        description: "Gary Jordan (Host):  Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, episode 64, Space Weather.  I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be host today.  So, in this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, and astronauts, all to let you know what's going on right here at NASA.  So, if you're familiar with us, you'll know that we recently just completed a five-part series on the hazards of human spaceflight.  One of those topics was on radiation and Dr. Zarana Patel gave us a great perspective on what's going on and what we're doing to learn what happens to the body when exposed to space radiation, especially for long periods of time.  So, today we're exploring what's being done right now to document radiation exposure, not only to make us-- to make sure our astronauts are healthy, but to really understand it.  So, Dr. Steve Johnson is one of the senior scientists of the space radiation analysis group.  Does not only that, but designs hardware, conducts physics modeling and 3D modeling and uses data to plan for future missions.  But first I wanted to start with Dr. Patel, who gives us a nice overview of why studying this is so important.    Dr. Zarana Patel: So, to date, there are four health risks from space radiation exposure that we identify.  The first one is cancer, the risk of radiation-induced carcinogenesis and that includes epithelial cancers and leukemias, and this is actually the biggest contributor to this permissible exposure limit that-- that's the standard we set for our astronauts.  The next one is the risk of in-flight and late CNS decrement.  So, CNS is central nervous system, and basically it's the risk of behavioral or cognitive decrements, either in flight or late post-mission, which can manifest in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's.    Host: Oh, wow.    Dr. Zarana Patel: In this one, we're targeting pathology that can have commonalities between those disorders and cardiovascular disease, which brings me to the next risk, which is the risk of radiation-induced cardiovascular disease.  But it's not just cardiovascular disease, it includes things like cataracts and other degenerative tissue effects, such as immune decrements, respiratory and digestive dysfunction, early aging or premature aging.  And, finally, the last one is the risk of acute radiation syndromes.  This is really a specific one for solar flares or what we call solar particle events.  So, this one is a more intermittent, but large-dose exposure from a solar flare and you have things like skin burns, prodromal responses, nausea.  This one is fairly effectively shielded against.    Host: That was a clip from our first episode on the hazards of human space flight, radiation, but today we're diving deep into our real-time operations dealing with radiation and space weather with Dr. Steve Johnson.  So, with no further delay, let's get right to it.  Enjoy.    [ Music ]    Host:  Thanks for coming today, Steve.  This is an interesting topic.  I'm calling it space weather, but it's-- I don't think it's exactly what it sounds like.  When I think of weather, I think of rains, clouds, I think of thunder, but space weather is a little bit different, isn't it?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Well, it's a little different, yes, but it's similar in that it's a changing environment.  In this case, rather the changing environment of the atmosphere around us.  We're looking at how the environment is changing in space around us.  And, in this case, what the parameters that are changing are charged particles, magnetic fields, the solar wind-- a lot of different parameters, but in the end it's the charged particles and the radiation that we're most concerned about and we want to monitor how that changes with time and what drives us-- what drives all of these dynamic changes or changes that occur at the sun on various time scales.  And so we want to be kind of solar physicists in a way, but that's what starts the cold front and warm fronts or whatever, if you will.  They have the influences to change how the space environment changes around us.    Host: Really, so it's mainly an environmental thing.  The changing environment, that is the weather, but it seems like the sun is the primary source of that weather.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Yes, it is.    Host: OK.  So-- and you said-- I guess we'll start with radiation because radiation is probably one of the more significant things that you're looking at.  Right?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Well, that's our primary purpose is for-- we want to monitor the radiation environment for crew health purposes, for radiation health and protection.  We also advise the flight team when there are changes in the environment that may be of concern to people that have, say, hardware that are-- might have-- are sensitive to radiation, but our primary focus is working within-- at least for the operations crew within the space radiation analysis group.  The operations portion, that's our primary focus is to watch out for the crew.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And actually it kind of turns around the other way.  A lot of times it's watching out for the flight control team because everybody hears radiation and everybody goes hysterical.  You know?  And so a lot of times we're-- more often than not, we're preventing radiation hysteria and saying no, this isn't a big deal, just calm down and this is-- this is fine, you know, we don't need to do anything.  And so, more often than not, that's our story then the sky is falling.    Host: Yeah, exactly.  And it's not so much, you know, we have to worry about the folks here on Earth, it's the folks here on Earth worried about what's going on in space.  We've got a nice little protective bubble, the magnetic sphere, right, that keeps us kind of safe.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Between the atmosphere and the-- Earth's magnetic field, we get a lot of protection.  And the space-- and the space station gets a lot of protection from the magnetic field.  Most of the time we're protected.  Maybe say 95% of the time we're protected by the magnetic field and there's only 5% of the time that we intermittently kind of slip out from underneath this radiation protection umbrella and can see free space radiation and so those are the intervals of times that we're most concerned with.    Host: Interesting.  Yeah, we've talked about radiation before on the podcast, mostly from the biological perspective, but not so much from the operational.  The day-to-day, you know, here's what we're doing every day to make sure the crew is healthy onboard.  So, I kind of wanted to start with because radiation is such a big part of space weather, diving into that.  What is radiation?  Let's start there.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Well, radiation generally is-- in a generic sense, it's transferring-- it's transfer of energy.  In the case-- in our case, in our specific application, radiation are-- is composed of charged atomic nuclei.  Usually they're fully ionized, so they don't have any electrons.  And they have very high kinetic energies and they will move along at high velocities until they encounter matter of some sort and then they will have interactions primarily with the electrons of the substrate and then they will slowly give up their kinetic energy and when people become that mass that they're slowing down in, the energy is transferred to the electrons and the electrons are what create all the bonds of all the big molecules, so we're disrupting those bonds.  And when that's your DNA, if you disrupt those bonds, you're disrupting the cellular code and you might kill the cell outright or you may have some artifact that's been modified but still stable enough to be passed on to future generations.   And it's that type of damage that becomes-- the damage of highest concern is that some stable alteration in the DNA code could be carried on.    Host: Wow.  So, it's not really something you feel, kind of, an ever presence thing.  It's something that's small but high energy and has a lot of impacts over time.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Yeah, that's right.  It's-- you can't-- you can't feel it.    Host: Yeah.  Yeah.  So, is a lot of it, you said-- like you said, coming from the sun, but is there-- is there a part that's galactic cosmic rays, anything other than the sun too?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Well, the sun gives us the short bursts of radiation that-- of high-- well, there's always-- there's always charged particles coming off the sun and that's called the solar wind and it's benign.  It doesn't have the sufficient energy to be of concern ever.  It's just the short bursts that we get during solar proton events that protons are accelerated at high enough energies that they can penetrate the spacecraft and penetrate into the person and give them some exposure.    Host: Oh.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Normally, day-to-day, we have two primary sources of radiation.  One is the trapped radiation belts or the Van Allen belts, if you will.  Those are mostly trapped protons, trapped electrons, and we pass through a certain region of the orbit where that belt comes close to the Earth.  And we pass through that about six times a day.  And then the rest of the time it's just kind of this background radiation which is from the galactic cosmic radiation.    Host: Ah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And the source of that is from outside the-- outside the solar system, throughout the galaxy, maybe particles even from galaxies far, far away.  And they just have very-- you know, created maybe during supernovas and these nuclei are being accelerated at very high energies and much higher than the solar protons or the trapped radiation.  They're very, very penetrating and they're also-- it's about 90% protons, so you have 10% that's not protons.  And, as the atoms get heavier, they are capable of doing more damage biologically.  They're of more concern and so when we start leaving Earth's-- low Earth orbit to be in free space, whether you're on the moon or on the way to Mars, the GCR-- galactic cosmic radiation-- the GCR exposure is increased and becomes more of a threat that, you know, we might exceed what our current limits are.   There's no reprieve from this chronic low-level radiation that's very damaging and that becomes a big concern for those types of missions.    Host: You said daily dose of radiation is coming from the ever-present galactic cosmic radiation.  It's still not a lot because of the protection we have because we're in low Earth orbit versus being out-- deeper out into space.    Dr. Steve Johnson: It's modulated, so it's-- I don't know, maybe a third or a quarter of what it would be if we were in free space.  That's the total amount of GCR that we receive while we're in low Earth orbit is about a third or a quarter of what it might be in free space.    Host: Now, I didn't realize that the-- I thought the space station was pretty low, but it seems like it's peeking out into little bits of the Van Allen radiation belt ever-- a couple times a day you said, right?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Well, you can't-- the only way you can avoid the-- that region of the trapped radiation belts that comes down real low is known as the South Atlantic anomaly.    Host: Ah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And very conveniently, it is located over the South Atlantic near South America.  It's slowly drifting west with time, so I guess they may have to rename it after a few decades and-- but-- because it will be in a different position, but that's part of the weakening of the magnetic field.  The only way to avoid the trapped radiation is to fly at low altitudes and then you're flying where the atmosphere is thick enough still that it really reduces the amount of radiation from the trapped protons.  But if you go to higher altitudes, you get increasingly larger trapped doses.    Host: Yeah, 250 miles above the Earth is a pretty nice spot.  It's high enough where you don't have to really worry about atmospheric drag too much, just a little bit, you have to reboost every once in a while, but it's low enough where you're getting a decent amount of radiation protection.    Dr. Steve Johnson: It works both ways.    Host: Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: OK, less-- you know, the atmosphere being like-- the atmosphere being an influence on satellite drag, it's also a drag on protons, on the space radiation, so you have less satellite drag, you have less drag on the protons, so you really start having higher doses.  So, there winds up to be this trade that if you want to fly really high and not have reboosts because you're trying to avoid the drag of the spacecraft-- on the spacecraft-- you wind up getting more dose.  So, there is a-- there is a trade there that spacecraft drag wins in the pocketbooks.    Host: Yeah.  So, let's go into what your group does, the space radiation analysis group.  It's got quite a lot of different, I guess, areas that you're focusing on, but one of them-- one of the ones is the-- is what we mentioned up front, which is just the day-to-day operations of what's going on aboard the space station.  So, what are you doing to monitor the-- what's the radiation environment of the International Space Station?    Dr. Steve Johnson: We go-- we-- we're part of mission control and we go in every day.  We report to the flight surgeon and the flight director.    Host: OK.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And we go in every day and fire up our systems and make sure everything is running right, make-- check on all our instruments.  We have a half dozen radiation instruments that are on the space station.  We check on their status, check on the data trends, check on the space weather, what we see.  We coordinate with a group in the-- with NOA, National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.  They have a group that's called the Space Weather Prediction Center, which is kind of like the national space weather service, if you will.  And we talk to them-- and they're the experts-- and we compare notes about what we see for trends and it's up to us to kind of take what their total outlook is and apply it to our specific situation with our mission.  We also-- besides checking our instruments, make sure our computer codes are running, up and running.   Check on just the normal admin for being part of mission operations.  What's happen-- just what's happening, you know, on the ground or what the crew schedule is and such things and put that all together.  And then we're on-call.  We have two people that are always on-call every day and we're supposed to be able to respond back within 45 minutes if we get a page and one of our-- one of our systems is a server that is ingesting space weather data and if it pulls in values that are above thresholds that we've established, then we get email notifications which tells us to come in and NOAA SWPC, space weather predictions center, will also give us a call and let us know.  So, we have a little bit of redundancy in terms of how we get notified.  We have one server is prime.  We have another server that's doing the same job, but just checking to make sure the first one's running so it'll send us a note if it doesn't-- if the prime was not running.   And then the Space Weather Prediction Center has its own email and they follow up with a phone call.  So, we're not likely-- and we have two people, so we're not likely to miss a call in.  So, that's kind of our ops work in a nutshell.    Host: Nice.  So, this-- I'm trying to think about-- you said space weather and you'll get notified if something is happening.  What are some of the events that would be happening that you would get notified and says hey come in in 45 minutes?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Well, the primary thing would be for what we would call an energetic proton event and that would be a situation where an event has occurred on the sun and normally that event is a coronal mass ejection.  There's a couple ways to accelerate protons, but the ones that really generate the events that are the big threat to us are generated by the development of a coronal mass ejection and as that coronal mass is-- becomes disconnected magnetically from the photosphere and starts to rise, there's a shockwave that goes through the corona and accelerates the protons and then that's what arrives.  But, as that develops, there's a lot of energy that's being released across the, you know, electromagnetic spectrum.  There's big-- there's large x-ray flares, which becomes our first indication that something goes on-- that something's occurring.  You know, why-- you know, we get a page if it's above an M5 flare.   So, we have to go and look and see, well, why did we have that flare?  Is that something of importance?  Is it of-- is it at a location on the sun that's important or not?  And if it is important, we'll probably also have radio bursts, called type II radio sweeps, radio bursts, type IV, 10-centimeter bursts.  I like to refer to them as Dr. Pepper events, 10, two, and four, but if we get those-- and that's usually an indication collectively between a large x-ray flare and the radio burst that there is a proton event occurring and then with our knowledge of-- our situational awareness of where the regions are on the sun and what's the probable threat, we know pretty quick whether we might see protons, you know, quickly or slowly, but we kind of have a feel for being able to anticipate at that point and can respond.  And then when we cross those thresholds, SWPC also lets us know.   So, the Space Weather Prediction Center is letting us know the details of the flare, about where it is, how big it was.  If they think the protons are going to come up, they have a code that they run that helps try to predict what the probability is just based on the parameters that have been active with the flare as-- at the onset of the event.    Host: So, when-- I'm guessing you're getting this data all the time.  What do you see normally?  Is it kind of going off in all different directions and don't really have to worry about it coming towards Earth very frequently?    Dr. Steve Johnson: That's an interesting question.  There's a couple variants of that.  One is the sun is usually not very active, so--    Host: Oh, good thing for us, I guess.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Yeah, but it makes it boring for us.  You know?  Today's forecast is boring to mostly boring.  There's no sunspots on the sun today.  But on the threat end, just when something does occur, it can have a pretty wide longitudinal distribution in terms of influence.    Host: Wow.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Even though-- well, we have our best magnetic connection to somewhere on the western hemisphere of the sun.  So, if something happens there, we can have protons here almost right away.    Host: Oh.    Dr. Steve Johnson: If it's on the east side of the sun, we may get protons, but it may take a day or so for them to get above our action levels.  I mean we can see them slowly trickle up, but they're so far away they have to diffuse across the magnetic field lines of the sun and that just takes a while.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: So, in some cases we're directly connected, in some cases we're not so connected, but the influence can be very wide.    Host: Wow, that's kind of scary to think that something happening on the west hemisphere if-- you would see the effects almost immediately.  So, there's-- in that case, I guess, operationally there's nothing much that you can do?  You can't, you know, shelter in place or anything?    Dr. Steve Johnson: If-- when we're-- well, we have a very good example of one that-- such an event occurred back in January of 2005 and it's a good illustration.  The protons were arriving before the flare had even finished peaking, so that was unusual just in that fact alone.  Plus it was the highest protons that-- for a particular energy band that we looked at.  Energetic protons were higher than they've been in the space program, so we had all this occurring at the same time.  Now, the thing was is that the crew happened to be on orbital paths that it was not slipping out from underneath that protection anytime soon, so we had eight hours to-- for the orbit to process before we would have the risk of the crew being-- encountering extra exposure from the sun.  And so they had just gone to bed, so we didn't do anything.   There wasn't any shelter for them because there's no-- there wasn't any influence from the event because of the orbital track.    Host: I see.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And so by the time they got up, the event had decayed a lot and so they just let them do their normal business, which is, you know, working in the lab and such.  The lab is pretty well shielded, so it's a good place to be during an event.  It's a good place to be working so we can continue our ops, you know, we don't want to stop ops, but, you know, if we need to do that, we, you know, we can make that recommendation.  But anyway, we were protected most of the time, so there's this factor of where you are in your orbit that-- that's our first question when we realize something's going on is where are we in the orbit and are we approaching one of those regions where we slip out from being not protected and so we start counting down when that's going to occur because that's when if we were going to do some sort of shelter sort of thing, if you will, that's when we would need to take that protection.  And that protection would only be for maybe 10 minutes every 45 minutes for a few hours during the day.    Host: Yeah.  When you say orbit, do you mean the orbit of the space station around the Earth?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Yes.    Host: So, depending on that position, maybe the-- are you thinking the Earth is going to maybe protect the space station and the crew a little bit more?    Dr. Steve Johnson: No.  It's all the magnetic field.    Host: It's the magnetic field.    Dr. Steve Johnson: The magnetic field of the Earth is not aligned with the spin axis, so it's tilted.    Host: OK.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And it also doesn't intersect at the inner-- at the center of the planet and so it's-- that offset is-- well, that's part of what-- that tilt and offset is what creates the South Atlantic anomaly that we talked about earlier.    Host: I see.    Dr. Steve Johnson: But it also lowers the amount of magnetic protection over the north-- northern part of North America over Canada, that's not very well protected.    Host: OK.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And if you get over the Indian Ocean, west of Australia, that section in the Indian Ocean, when we cross those geographic points, we're crossing into areas that are not magnetically protected.    Host: I see.  So, that's your first question.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And so that-- so that is, you know, are we approaching those regions and if we're not approaching those regions, then we're protected.  Even if there's an EVA and we had a big proton event going, if we're not crossing those specific zones, then there's no danger, if you will, from the proton event during those--    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Until you do that.    Host: So, how much of it is watching out and watching the crew health and how much of it is watching the vehicle health?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Our role is to-- is crew health.    Host: Crew health.  So, what are you doing--    Dr. Steve Johnson: We just provide notification.  We just tell the-- we just tell the-- I mean the flight director knows anyway.  We say, oh, we're on recall because we had a-- we've got a proton event going on.  So, we go in, once we have an energetic proton event started, we're on 24-hour coverage.  Before, our daily-- our normal routine, we only go in for the mornings just to check on everything and then we're just on-call for the rest of the day and the weekend.    Host: I see.    Dr. Steve Johnson: But once we cross those thresholds for the protons, then we are there 24 hours.  But we will remind the flight director, oh, well, we have a proton event, you should notify the other flight control centers so that everybody knows.  So, if somebody's got equipment, you know, just put out that everybody-- just put out as a note that everybody can see when those times are and it's up to them to protect their equipment if they need to do that.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: But our purpose is the-- strict-- is primarily the crew.    Host: Yeah, and providing information to the teams and the crew.  Are you watching the crew's radiation-- I guess how much they're absorbing over time?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Well, we make estimates about what we think they're going to receive during the course of their mission.    Host: OK.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And then we monitor it daily.  We can't really-- we don't really monitor what their dose is exactly.  We monitor what the levels are.  So, if the dose rates are higher than we expected, then we know they're probably getting a little more dose than what we projected at the beginning or vice versa.    Host: OK.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And-- so we watch those trends.  We watch for those trends to see if there's a change throughout the mission and once the mission is over we have some idea what the total radiation was just based on the instruments.  But more specifically, each crew member has a radiation badge that they wear, a personal dosimeter, and we get that back down when they arrive on the ground.    Host: Oh.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And then that gets analyzed and that gives us the value that will go into their medical records.    Host: OK.  OK, so it's documented, I guess, your total career exposure.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Yes.  It's tracked for all their-- each flight there'll be an entry for what their exposure is.  We track it-- we track their exposure in terms of percent risk and not necessarily so much dose.    Host: OK.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And so our limits are really based on risk levels.    Host: OK.  So, the limits would be-- I mean if you've flown in space x number of times and been up there x number of days, maybe you have-- you've absorbed enough radiation where that's probably your last flight.  Is that kind of how it works?    Dr. Steve Johnson: You could get to that point, hypothetically.    Host: OK.  Yeah, no, I mean there's astronauts with hundreds of days, so I know it's like-- it's not.    Dr. Steve Johnson: It's a function of-- the risk factors vary as you get older.    Host: Oh.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And it varies between the sexes.  Women are more radiosensitive than men.    Host: Oh.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And young people are more radiosensitive than old guys like me.    Host: Really?  The younger you are, the more sensitive you are to--    Dr. Steve Johnson: Right, because you've got your cells are turning over more rapidly and so you're going through more cell generations.  Whereas when-- as you get older, cells turn over much more slowly.  So, if you have some damage to a cell, there's-- it takes longer to go through those number of generations before you might see that effect, if an effect was to occur.  The other part is is that time in your life is that we also-- you can also kind of think of it as loss of life, so to speak, quality of life.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: If you're, you know, a 40-year-old astronaut and, you know, there's some cancer takes 40 years to develop once you've had some, you know, event occur, well that makes you 80.  Well, people live to be 80, so you're really kind of still kind of in that zone where that is kind of like a loss of quality of life impact.  Whereas if you were 60 years old and flew and takes 40 years for it to develop, you're 100.  Well, are you really having a quality of life issue at that point?  Well, no, you've kind of-- you're out there where, you know, most people don't live, so you're-- it's not really a loss of life effect, so to speak.  So, as you get older, there's less time in front of you for, you know, a cancer to develop or some cardiovascular sort of issue to develop.    Host: I see.  So, for a radiation perspective, you're looking at flying senior citizens.  Not so much?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Maybe not.    Host: There's a lot of other factors besides radiation, isn't there, for what makes an astronaut successful?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Yeah.    Host: So, I mean you're watching career exposures.  You're talking about some of the dosimeters and some of the hardware actually measuring these dose rates, both on the astronaut and you said there's six-- you said there's half a dozen--    Dr. Steve Johnson: I said there's about a half a dozen.    Host: About a half a dozen.    Dr. Steve Johnson: It kind of changes a little bit.    Host: So, what are the instruments and what are they doing?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Oh my.    Host: Big question.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Yeah, I should have brought a list.  Well, let's start with the simple things.    Host: OK.    Dr. Steve Johnson: The radiation badge sort of dosimeters, they use what's called TLDs, trans-- thermoluminescent dosimeters and they're little crystals that are radiation sensitive and you zero them out, if you will, fly them, let them get exposed, and you bring them down and then you read them.    Host: Oh.    Dr. Steve Johnson: So, yeah, but-- so you don't find out any information while they're flying.  You only get the data once you get them back down to the ground and analyze them.  And we change those out about twice a year.    Host: Oh.    Dr. Steve Johnson: So, every six months we make a measurement.  So, it's-- it just kind of gives us an idea of what the average dose is for the six months at different locations.  So, you have the same type of measurement over a half-- over-- I don't know, a couple dozen locations.  We're reducing that slowly because we've characterized the station well enough that we can just kind of go to a few reference points and keep track of the trends.  The crew also has a badge that's similar to that, so that goes up with them and comes down with them and we read that.    Host: OK.    Dr. Steve Johnson: The workhorse that we have is-- it's a-- it's known as a tissue equivalent gas proportional counter.  And that's kind of our workhorse.  It gives us-- it gives us the amount of-- the radiation dose rate.  It's telemeter data, so we're talking about an active instrument now.    Host: OK.    Dr. Steve Johnson: An active instrument-- when I say an active instrument, that means it requires electrical power of some sort.    Host: And you're getting data more frequently.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And we get data telemetered down every minute from it and so that allows us to check what the exposure rates are during proton events, so we're watching to see it, you know, how much it goes up when we hit those zones where we're not really protected in the orbit.  It also has a dose rate-- a high dose rate alarm for the crew.  If for some reason weren't in communication, they would at least get a-- some notification that there is a radiation event going on.  So, we had two-- we had two of those on-- we have two different models on station.  We also had some-- what are called charged particle telescopes, which are a series of silicon discs, wafers, not very thick, but a stack of them.  And so each one is a separate sensor and you line them up and it-- and you watch radiation as it goes, penetrates that stack of detectors and look at how much energy is deposited in each of the sensors.   There may be as many as, I don't know, 10 sensors, and we had a-- we've had a couple internal instruments that are of that type of design and we have one external instrument that had three units in it that's located outside.  And we've also got these newer instruments that-- they're about the size of little-- of a oversize USB stick that sticks inside the-- the instrument itself sticks into the side of a laptop and it's also a silicon detector that's-- when I say a silicon detector, I don't mean it's detecting silicon, I mean it's-- the material is silicon and you're watching the radiation as it hits the silicon.  And it's a semiconductor, so it's basically kind of like a big diode and so you're watching the signal that comes off, how much energy's being deposited in that silicon detector as, you know, the-- as the day goes on.   And so we have-- we're kind of shifting over to those because they're much-- they're much more compact sort of instruments than the tissue equivalent proportional counter-- TPECs as we acronymize them.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: The mass and volume are very important when we start considering going to the moon and to Mars, so having these larger detectors doesn't make sense from a mass standpoint, so we're kind of shifting over to using these smaller detectors and having those spread out around the station instead of the little passives.  For a variety of reasons.    Host: Yeah.  Seems like there's a lot of instruments, a lot of data, a lot of recording, a lot of monitoring.  Is there a database that you're keeping track of with all of these things?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Yeah, we can go back and-- I mean I do it frequently when I'm analyzing old events or whatever.  I can always go back and pull up the data from any of the proton events that we've had or at any time and look at what the trend was, what the background was for whatever purposes I'm trying to analyze.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And we can do that for all of our instruments.    Host: Is there-- is there any sort of predictive models where based on the information you have you can make guesses on what kinds of space weather is going to be happening or is it really just kind of reactive?  It just-- that's just the way it is.    Dr. Steve Johnson: In terms of space weather, we're really in what would be called a nowcast situation.  So, we have to watch things evolve.  However, we have situational awareness that allows that-- we try to develop the skill to now when we have high threats and low threats and most of the time it's easy to discern that it's a low threat because these proton events and what leads to them are very, you know, specific sort of situations that aren't-- don't develop frequently.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: So, from that standpoint, we have to, you know, on a day-to-day basis it's nowcasting.  But overall, for the solar cycle, there's a cycle effect on what the dose rates are to the-- to the crews of the station and so as the sun goes through its cycle of being from solar min to solar max, the dose rates are changing as a function of that.  And so, based on where we are in the solar cycle, we may adjust what we might project for their dose rate for their mission.  And we have some models that try to do that, but it's not an easy thing to do.    Host: What's solar min and solar max?  What's happening there?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Part of the sun's dynamics is it goes through this long-term cycle that we call the solar cycle and it goes from a period of time when there is virtually no sun spots, no features on the sun, and we call that solar minimum.    Host: Minimum activity.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Minimum activity.  And the-- what's happening is the sun's-- I was amazed when I-- when I learned this.  The sun's magnetic pole is reversing every 11 years.    Host: Whoa.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And so, as it goes through this process of reversing, kind of in the middle of that process when it's kind of-- kind of more toward being neutral, if you will.  It's not really neutral, but kind of in the middle of that, that's when we start having all the hot-- a large number of sun spots and active regions on the sun and the sun is prone to producing these proton events.  And then that's solar maximum.  And then the field continues to flip and we get back to a solar minimum.  And so, from minimum to minimum, your magnetic polarity reverses.  And to get it back to where it was to start with, you really have to go through the cycle twice to get the pole to flip again.    Host: Yeah, that's right.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And so there's even and odd cycles.  Well-- in conjunction with that activity, there is-- there is a way-- there's-- the output in ultraviolet in a particular wavelength changes between solar min and solar max and that wavelength is ultraviolet and it's readily absorbed by the atmosphere and it causes the atmosphere to expand.  So, when we go to solar minimum, we don't have as much of that UV radiation coming in and being absorbed by the atmosphere and the atmosphere cools and contracts.  And that makes for less spacecraft drag.    Host: Oh.    Dr. Steve Johnson: And so, when-- during solar maximum, that ultraviolet output increases, atmosphere expands and becomes drag on the spacecraft.  So, that's why we have this solar min solar max drag on the spacecraft sort of thing.  And just as I mentioned earlier, drag on the spacecraft is drag on protons, so when you have less drag on the protons, the dose goes up.  The more drag, it goes down.  So, during solar minimum-- it sounds backwards, but during solar minimum our dose rates may be twice as high as they would be during solar maximum for our day-to-day doses.    Host: Because you have less atmospheric protection because it's--    Dr. Steve Johnson: Because-- yes.  Yes.    Host: Wow.  That is-- that does sound kind of backwards, but then I guess--    Dr. Steve Johnson: And it also-- on a larger scale, it's not due to the ultraviolet, but over-- - due to the activity of the sun and the solar wind and such.  You also wind up having the same sort of cycle on the galactic cosmic radiation that it also is higher during solar minimum periods than it is during solar maximum periods.  So, solar minimum are-- we have our highest doses and then solar maximum we have lower doses, but we have the risk of these short bursts from proton events that may add to the crew exposures.    Host: Is it the-- is it the increased activity in the sun during solar maximum that's sort of pushing away the galactic cosmic rays?  Is that what-- is that kind of what's happening there?  Or is it something else?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Yeah, in a way.  It's the solar wind and a combination of a few things that, you know, the-- you know, the particles are coming from very far away and they see-- you know, there's just a little bit of influence and it changes and it just-- this far into the solar system, it does make a big difference.    Host: So, this makes me think about deep space missions.  If you were planning a deep space mission, from a radiation perspective, what's the right time?  What's the more appropriate time to send people out to-- let's just say we have gateway around the moon to send people to around the moon.  Is it during solar minimum or maximum?  Does radiation even play a part in the planning?    Dr. Steve Johnson: It does play a part in the planning because we have to address the issue.  Does it determine the timing?  Well, if you want to make this a long-term project to be on the moon and go to Mars and not just have one shot sort of things, then you've got to just be able to deal with the risk of the exposures.  Going during solar minimum times, you're getting a lot more exposure from the GCR and that's not-- that's not a good thing, so we have to find ways to kind of try to minimize that dose somehow.    Host: Right.    Dr. Steve Johnson: It's not easy to shield, but, you know, you go to Mars, you've got a big spacecraft, got a lot of mass, so maybe using that mass prudently, maybe you can give yourself more protection.  You get a little more protection on the surface of the moon because you've got the planetary body giving you, you know, some sort of shielding.    Host: Sure.    Dr. Steve Johnson: But you have to consider it, but I'm not sure you can say one's a better time than the other.  You know?    Host: What about the risk of solar flares or coronal mass ejections?  Do you have to-- would you want to travel during a minimum just to avoid the off chance that you could be affected during transit?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Well, the thing is is that the solar proton events are easier to shield.    Host: Really?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Because they're lower energy.  So, you can make a shelter, if you will, that can make a significant impact on the short-term events.  So, in some ways, you know, the better time to go might be during-- if you're just trying to pick one time, you know, solar maximum may be a kind of a better time because--    Host: Lower overall dose, maybe?    Dr. Steve Johnson: That-- the low-- the background radiation levels are at their lowest, which is what you really care about, and then the short-term bursts that are maybe high dose rate, you can shield against them.  Plus their-- the damaging capability of the protons is not the same as the higher atomic number of species that you have in the GCR.    Host: So, are you looking at mostly low Earth orbit when you're looking at all this data for radiation and monitoring the crew health, or are you really looking further out into space, you know, beyond the Earth, maybe towards the moon, Mars, in-between, to understand the environment for deep space missions?    Dr. Steve Johnson: Well, I think we get a feel for what the environment is in general.  I mean specifically we're flying low Earth orbit, so our application is for low Earth orbit, but it's also-- we know what's happening here locally and the moon's not that far away, really, so what we see here is-- would-- is also same thing for the moon.  So, whatever our practices are in terms of monitoring-- kind of in the cislunar neighborhood, we're good.    Host: That's good.  Yeah, you don't have to rewrite everything.  Yeah.  That's good.  What-- and now for Mars, I'm assuming it's just going to be a little bit different.  Maybe communication is an issue because if a solar activity happens, you have to deal with the communication delay.    Dr. Steve Johnson: That-- we're not-- we're still kind of working through how we might want to deal with such things.  We also need more longitudinal monitoring of the sun from other angles because what we see here on Earth may not be what's being influencing a spacecraft on it's way to Mars or at Mars.  So, it may-- you know, more resources are going to be needed in order to be able to do some-- to do-- just to monitor the space weather so we can do our forecasting and analysis and keep the crew advised.    Host: So, are you talking about like satellites and probes to go out kind of towards different areas and fill in those gaps?  OK.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Be able to see the sun from different angles.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Steve Johnson: We had that opportunity over the last decade or so that we've had what was called the stereo mission, which sent a pair a of space weather monitoring spacecraft, one ahead in orbit and one kind of lagging the Earth orbit and going around the sun very slowly.  It took a decade or so to get to the far side of the sun and then they switched and now they're kind of coming back.  But, that other perspective of the sun-- we need to be able to see from those other angles to really-- to do the right job to support a Mars mission.    Host: So, thinking about that-- and we can sort of wrap up with this idea-- what sorts of other gaps do we need to fill to make a deep space mission, like a one to Mars, successful?  Especially from a radiation perspective.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Well, I think the physics-- we kind of know the physics.  So, we know-- we have the type of technical information to work on shields and maybe try to optimize some shield designs to try to provide a little bit of more protection.  The big question-- and I think we can respond to the short-term influences of proton events and such, but the big question is going to be the effects of the chronic exposure to the galactic cosmic radiation.  The radiobiology, I think there's just a lot that we still don't know.  That doesn't mean we-- I don't know that that stops us from going, but-- I don't know that we'll ever have all the answers, but I think trying to get a handle on some of that is a very big challenge.   Exposures to-- I mean we understand that-- well, I say we understand-- I mean-- radiation and cancer, that's kind of understood in a way.  I mean it's a stochastic process in that it's random whether you get an exposure and whether cancer develops, but some other things-- some other effects-- there's not really a good way to quantify them and-- for example, the neurological effects, getting radiation damage to your neural systems, what, you know, neurons don't grow back very quickly.  You know?  So, if you wind up killing off neurons here and there, that's not good.  And there may be other effects that are-- maybe with time that, you know, we'll know more about, but I think they're still hard to quantify, some of them, and those will always be a-- those will always be a challenge I think that's going to be hanging out there to understand.    Host: That seems to be a theme is there is so much that we don't know and that's the-- I guess the beauty of science is the more you learn, the more you realize that there's more to learn.  And-- but that should never stop you from exploring and I think that's what's awesome about NASA is you just kind of keep going.  You keep pursuing and it's this drive to explore that keeps us going out further.  I love it.  So, thank you, Steve, for coming on and talking about space weather and radiation, opening our eyes to this-- I guess not-seen part of spaceflight that's essential to understand to make it successful, so I appreciate you coming on.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Yeah.  Well, it is kind of an unseen thing.  We sit in the back room and nobody sees us as we come and go.  I could go throw in a story for that real quick.    Host: Yeah, do it.    Dr. Steve Johnson: Just to finish on a-- maybe a fun note.  I was-- I don't know, I think it was the fourth of July and I was in on the holiday.  We-- because at the time we went in every single day and-- like I said, we sit in a back room, so we're never really seen.  And gone down to the Coke machine and get something to drink and the flight director comes out of the bathroom and she walks up and she sees me standing there and looks and are you-- are you one of the radiation guys?  And I go oh, yes, yes, yes, she knows who I am.  Yes.  Yes, I'm one of the radiation guys.  She goes is it a bad thing that you're here?  No, no, we're just here for our regular shift.  She was concerned that there was some proton event going on and it wasn't going to be a quiet day.  So, OK, no.  It's a nice day on the sun.    Host: All right.  Well, I guess maybe soon it will be a good day whenever people see you come out of the back room a little bit.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.    Dr. Steve Johnson: OK.  Thank you.    [ Music ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So, today we talked with Dr. Steve Johnson.  We talked about space weather, radiation, and really understanding the sun and how that affects our day-to-day operations for human space flight.  We talked earlier about the hazards of human space flight.  We have a couple episodes on those, five to be exact, plus a little intro.  So, you can go back and watch-- or listen-- to those episodes.  The five hazards of human space flight, nasa.gov/johnson/HWHAP, that is our site.  Or wherever you're subscribed to Houston, We Have a Podcast.  We also work with the human research program to come up with some supplementary materials for those.  So, if you go to nasa.gov/HRP, they have a section there called the five hazards of human spaceflight and you can click on the radiation section, space radiation, and they have a lot of extra materials if you want to really learn more about the radiation environment.  Otherwise, you can go to nasa.gov/iss or one of our many social media accounts for the International Space Station on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to know what's going on 250 miles above our heads.

        description: ">> Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the nasa johnson space center, episode 7: total eclipse over america. I m gary jordan and i ll be your host today. So this is the podcast where we bring in the experts-- nasa scientists, engineers, astronauts-- all to tell you the coolest stuff about nasa. So today we re talking about eclipses with mark matney. He s a space debris scientist here at the nasa johnson space center in houston texas, and he also has degrees in astronomy and space physics, and is an avid eclipse aficionado. We had a great discussion about what an eclipse is, some of the history of eclipses, and some of the science that we ve learned and continue to learn from them. This is an exciting conversation, especially because on august 21, 2017, a total solar eclipse will sweep across america. Mark and i talked about where the eclipse will pass through and how you ll be able to see it. They don t happen very often-- the last time a total solar eclipse happened over the states was back in 1991, and we won t see another until 2024. Anyway, we ll get into all that good stuff during this episode. So with no further delay, let s go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with dr. Mark matney. Enjoy. [ Music ] >> t minus five seconds and counting. Mark. [ Indistinct radio chatter ] >> houston, we have a podcast. [ Music ] >> all right, well, mark, thank you for coming on the podcast today. Perfect timing, because very soon we re going to have a total solar eclipse that s going to pass over the united states. And so i think this is a good chance for us to sit down and talk about eclipses. And you went above and beyond for this one, mark, because you have a lot of different things. I mean, we re talking a lot of science, we re talking a long and detailed history of eclipses. You know, this is not just a, ooh, look at that. Pretty eclipse. No, nasa s going all out for this-- is that fair to say? >> Well, i think this is-- i mean, eclipses have been part of human history as far back as we can record. People have been fascinated, scared, terrified by eclipses. >> Oh, sure. >> And a lot of important scientific discoveries have been driven by eclipses. I think today-- we re doing some science today, but much of the important science was done in the past. But this kind of links us in some sort of way to those early scientists who were trying to puzzle out the mysteries of the universe by using this amazing sight in the sky. So we have some science that s going on, we have some citizen science that s going on, and there s going to be a whole lot of people traveling to see this eclipse. In fact, i was reading that this eclipse is the first cross continent eclipse across the united states since the interstate system was built. >> Oh, wow. >> And so we might see one of the largest migrations of americans in a short period of time that we ve ever seen. [ Laughter ] because there s going to be a lot of people, perhaps tens of millions of people, traveling to see this eclipse. >> That s very true, and they re all going to be, i mean, closer to that nice, thin line-- we re talking about that path of totality, and we ll get into that really shortly, but you know, let s go and start at the very beginning, right? So we re talking about a total solar eclipse-- this is great-- passing over the united states. But what is that? What is a total solar eclipse? >> So a total eclipse is when the disk of the sun is completely covered by the moon. So the moon s size is maybe slightly larger than the sun, so we can get complete coverage. This particular eclipse is going to be about two and a half minutes of totality. Some eclipses are as high as seven minutes. Some of them are just a few seconds. >> And it s just the way things are aligning? >> Well, it turns out that the moon is actually not on a perfectly circular orbit. It s in a slightly elliptical orbit. So sometimes it s a little closer, and sometimes it s a little farther. >> Oh, i see. >> And so [ indistinct ] a little farther, it doesn t quite cover the surface of the sun. And what you end up with is a narrow ring all around. That s called an annular eclipse. And if the moon s a little larger-- in other words, a little closer, it appears a little larger in the sky, you get a total eclipse. And sometimes we actually have what s called a hybrid eclipse where you get an annular eclipse, but the mountains on the moon make it so it s actually a broken ring in the sky. It s so close, because actually, the mountains peeking up cover part of that sun ring. >> So can you see some of the sun peeking through those alleys, i guess? >> That s right, yes. >> Oh, interesting. >> And then that one, turns out if you could get higher in the altitude, in a balloon or plane, you might see a total eclipse in those kinds. But that s a special kind of eclipse that s actually quite rare. >> Wow. >> And then we also have a partial eclipse, and that s what-- it turns out this eclipse is interesting-- as far as i can tell, anyone in any of the 50 united states-- weather permitting-- should be able to see a partial eclipse, including alaska and hawaii. The partial eclipse is where the disk of the moon covers part of the sun but doesn t actually get to-- it s off to one side. >> Okay. >> And so you-- we re going to get a pretty good partial eclipse here from houston, but i think everybody, like i said, somewhere in the united states, one of the 50 states, should be able to see a partial eclipse. >> That ll be cool. >> So by the way, it s august 21st-- we didn t say the date. >> Yeah, so august 21st. And this will come out august 18th, so this ll be like-- >> oh, okay-- perfect. >> This ll be right next to it, yeah, absolutely. So a partial eclipse-- is there-- how-- is there a way that is very apparent to observe that? Like, will the sky get a little bit darker, or-- >> it depends on the percentage. When it s like about 50%, it s hard to notice. But once you get on to 60, 70, 80, 90%, the sky takes on an unusual color. And in fact, that s one of the things i m going to recommend eclipse observers-- just kind of note how the sky changes color, because it s a very interesting phenomenon. >> Yeah. >> But unless it s really-- in ancient times, people did not even notice a partial eclipse unless it was like 80, 90% because they started to see the sun dim, and they would look up at the sun and see there was no longer a disk in the sky. >> Wow. Okay, so from here in houston, what are we expecting percentage-wise? >> Well, i tried-- it s about somewhere around 70%. I don t know the exact area, but there s several tables. Also, that s another thing, is where you are, where the maximum eclipse changes on the clock. So there are computer resources where you can look and put in your location or your city and find out when the maximum eclipse is and how much. >> Oh, okay. Very cool. That s a lot of good stuff. All right, so that s 70%. We ll be able to see-- >> something like 70, yeah. >> A somewhat noticeable change in the sky, then, at least here from houston. That s really cool. So yeah, you said total versus partial. This is the solar eclipse, though, right? >> Right. >> This is when the moon is going in between the earth and the sun. >> Right. >> Like you said, they re relatively the same size in the sky, just based on distance and size, and so it only blocks off this tiny little strip of shadow that s going to go across the united states. And it goes-- you said it happens quite often, but just i guess at different parts of the world. >> Correct. >> It just so happens that it s going to line up this time going from coast to coast. >> And sometimes it s an annular, and sometimes-- but it turns out we get from three to five eclipses, solar eclipses, every year. >> Oh, okay. >> Which is actually kind of surprising. >> We meaning the earth. >> Someone on the earth, in other words, can see an eclipse. We actually have fewer-- there s another kind of eclipse called a lunar eclipse, and the lunar eclipse is when the earth gets between the moon and the sun. >> Right. >> And so as the moon moves into the shadow, it starts to turn dark, and sometimes has an interesting red color. >> Yeah. >> It turns out there are actually fewer of those than solar eclipses. >> Really? >> But because a whole hemisphere can see it, they re much-- you can see them much more often than solar eclipses. >> Oh, that-- okay. >> Because you re looking up in the sky and seeing the moon eclipse, so anybody on that side of the earth can see it-- weather permitting, of course. >> Wow. Why is it that color, though? >> Well, that s an interesting phenomenon. As you know, the sky is blue from the scattering of particles in the atmosphere-- it scatters the blue light. But the red is transmitted just like we see in a red sunset. Well, the earth s atmosphere actually refracts the red light, and so if you were standing on the moon during a lunar eclipse, the earth, of course, would block the sun, but you would see this red ring around the earth, which is the atmosphere refracting the light of the sun. >> So that s the red ring of the earth refracting off the surface of the moon? >> No, no, it s-- the light is coming through the atmosphere and refracting slightly to your position on the moon. >> Oh. >> So you would see this narrow, narrow red glowing ring around the earth. >> Oh, wow. >> So it s-- but of course, no one s ever seen that. >> Yeah. >> Maybe someday when we have a base on the moon. >> Oh, and so wait-- okay, so this is assuming that-- yeah, you re assuming that you are an observer on the moon. >> You re an astronaut standing on the moon, right. >> I see, and there s a red ring. So what about the lunar eclipse-- the perception from the earth? Doesn t a lunar eclipse-- the moon looks a little orange? >> Yeah, it s orange-ish, sometimes. It actually depends on-- it depends on what s happening in the atmosphere. >> Oh, okay. >> For instance, i saw an eclipse in 1982. We were expecting the red moon, but in fact, the moon looked charcoal gray. And that was right after the el chichon volcano in mexico erupted. And so the dust from the volcano had changed the dust in the atmosphere, so we didn t get much red. >> Oh. >> So it actually-- you never know what you re going to see when you see a lunar eclipse, but they re often red. And again, that s the red light that is bent by the earth s atmosphere and shines on the moon. >> Yeah, and it s reflecting-- interesting. So it s all entirely about perception, then, it s about the-- so you re a person on the earth, and this is what you perceive from the perspective of earth. If you were outside floating millions of miles away just observing it from afar, it would just look like the earth and the moon-- the moon wouldn t look a certain color. >> Well, you could see the color, because it s lit up with that color. Let me-- let s change it around. Let s say you were on the moon looking at the earth during a solar eclipse. And we have some photographs from the iss of previous eclipses, and you actually see a-- you can actually see the dark shadow. You can t see the sharp edge of the shadow, but you see this fuzzy black thing on the surface of the earth. And so you would see-- but instead of being the whole earth swallowed up, you just see this black fuzzy spot moving across the earth from space. >> Interesting. >> So hopefully-- it depends on where the iss will be at the time of the eclipse, but hopefully they ll be able to photograph it from-- they probably will not be in the eclipse path, but they could look down on the earth and see the shadow, hopefully, of the eclipse. >> Yeah, i think-- i think they are predicting that the iss is going to be somewhere over canada but will have a nice view of the states whenever it s actually the solar eclipse. >> It would be very, very coincidental if we happened to fly through the shadow, because the shadow is very narrow. It could happen, but i mean-- >> the odds are against us. >> The odds are against us. So a lunar eclipse happens at the full moon. >> Okay. >> When, of course, the sun is on the other side of the earth and the moon is-- if you re standing on the earth, the sun is behind you, because it s nighttime, and you see the-- and a solar eclipse happens at a new moon, when the moon is-- you can t really see it in the sky, because you re seeing the dark side of the moon. >> So you ll never see a crescent moon in a lunar eclipse? >> No, no, it s definitely a full moon, so as full as it gets. Another thing is lunar and solar eclipses are often paired, because that tilt of the moon s orbit, the point when it crosses the earth-sun orbit plane, is on both sides. And so usually we get an accompanying lunar eclipse with a solar eclipse. And in fact, the accompanying lunar eclipse for this eclipse is on august 7th, and will be visible from europe, africa, asia, and australia. >> Oh, okay. Well, there you go. >> Or was visible, i guess. >> August 7th, yeah. I guess-- aw. >> You want me to say that again? [ Laughter ] >> if we could go back in time okay, so i mean, that s kind of from the perspective of earth, right? We ve got solar eclipses, and when the moon is in between us here on earth and the sun, and then the opposite for the lunar eclipse. In general, if you had to give like a general overview, where else in the universe do eclipses happen? >> Everywhere. >> How about that. >> Anywhere where you have bodies moving around, one will often eclipse the view of another. But usually, what you-- you won t get to see the amazing sight on earth, because it s very rare that the object eclipsing looks in the sky the same size as the sun. >> Oh. >> So we know, for instance, there are eclipses caused by jupiter s moons as it orbits jupiter, and you can see the shadow on the surface of jupiter-- or the clouds, actually, of jupiter. >> Right. >> And in fact, there was a fellow named ole r mer-- if i m pronouncing correctly-- back in the 1600s that first detected the finite speed of light by looking at the timing of those eclipses on jupiter. So that s one of those science things that eclipses have allowed us to do. >> That s amazing-- just by looking at shadows across the universe, you can get all this crazy science. >> And sometimes-- i know we ve done occultations of stars, where a planet moves between us and the starlight of a star, and by measuring that star, we ve seen, like-- we ve found the rings of uranus, as the star would twinkle or would blink out just before uranus crossed the star. >> Oh. >> So you can actually do things like look for difficult to see rings, or also, as the light comes through the atmosphere, sometimes you can see the absorption of different chemicals in the atmosphere of the planet. >> And then understand the composition of the planet itself. >> Exactly. >> That s amazing. >> Let me add one thing we hadn t talked about. >> Yeah, sure. >> I found an interesting statistic, and it said that if you picked a random spot on the earth and you just stayed right there, you would see a solar eclipse about once every 375 years, on average. >> Okay, so you should move a little bit. >> Yeah, well-- you re not following. [ Laughter ] so during a normal person s long lifetime-- say, 70 years-- we re looking at a 20-25% chance that you would sometime in your lifetime see an eclipse, a total eclipse of the sun. So yes, it s rare, but not totally unknown. >> Yeah. >> So i just know that one never comes by my house, so i have to go chase it down. [ Laughter ] >> well, that s the great thing, is we have nasa-- we folks at nasa are actually looking at this stuff and making predictions. We know exactly where it s going to be on august 21st. >> That s correct, that s right. >> Yeah, so that kind of will help you see it a little bit, too. [ Laughter ] i think one of my favorites, though, when it comes to eclipses across the universe, is kepler, right? So if you think about-- you said occultations as one of them. That s when something passes in front of a star and changes the light that we re receiving. >> Right. >> That s how we are detecting planets outside of our solar system, correct? >> That s correct, yeah. The kepler mission is looking at a large group of stars and monitoring them constantly. And it has very, very sensitive instruments, so they can look at very small dips in the light as a planet-- a previously unknown planet-- transits the face of that star. And we ve been able-- and when they see them repeating, they can work out the relative sizes of the planets and their period, and work out where they are in orbit around that star. And we ve seen-- i don t know what the count is-- a thousand? >> Yeah, yeah. We keep finding more and more. >> There s a bunch of them. So this is actually one of the most interesting discoveries, i think, astronomers have made in the last several years, is that our galaxy is full of stars with planets. And it s pretty exciting-- it s kind of star trek stuff. >> It is! Especially just recently, the discovery of the trappist-1 system. >> Yes, indeed. >> And those-- we re talking about earth-like planets, and some of which are in what we like to call the goldilocks zone, right? >> That s right. >> And that s-- you know, water doesn t freeze, it doesn t-- >> that s right, it s not too hot, not too cold. >> Not too cold, right, and liquid water can exist. And that s conditions for life, and it s very exciting. >> It is. >> That s what we re looking for, right-- life outside of the universe. >> And i ll also mention we also have transits here, just like what we see with kepler, of the planets mercury and venus, which are inside the orbit of earth. And we recently had a venus transit visible from the us. >> Yeah, 2012, right?? >> That s right, i think it was 2012. And i ve also seen mercury transits as well. Those have an interesting history, because scientists in the 18th century were trying-- they d figured out the relative distance to the different planets, but they didn t know an absolute distance. And they were actually going to use different observers on the earth to measure the transit of venus to try and get an absolute scale. And so that was the cutting edge science in the 18th century. >> Wow. [ Laughter ] >> but so that s another point where transits and eclipses have been an important part of the history of science. >> Amazing. I mean, that s kind of a big theme here, right, especially for eclipses, is the science that we can get from observing these phenomena. >> That s right. >> So i mean, from here on the ground, what are some of the things that we can learn-- and i guess in the instance of a solar eclipse, but you know, eclipses in general-- what are some of the things that we can learn from studying these? >> Well, let s kind of go through some of the discoveries that were made with eclipses. >> Sure. >> So from ecl-- we all look up at the sun and see a bright disk. That s called the photosphere. It s very, very bright, and we ll talk about that a little bit. That s the part we re familiar with. It s about 10,000 degrees fahrenheit-- it s nice and hot. But during eclipses, astronomers notice some red layer-- a thin red layer around the sun. And that s known as the chromosphere. And that was discovered by eclipses, and it turns out chromosphere is due to emissions from atomic hydrogen in the sun s atmosphere. >> Okay. >> And so if you-- the soho spacecraft sometimes show-- i mean-- the soho spacecraft show-- is constantly monitoring the sun. And one of its instruments is a hydrogen alpha filter, and you can see what that chromosphere looks like. It s a very thin layer of the sun, again, that we discovered by looking at eclipses. The next section-- oh, by the way, some scientists-- in 1868, there was a new instrument that was developed called the spectroscope. And the spectroscope splits light into its component colors. And they had discovered that there were specific lines, almost like a fingerprint, that defined-- that were unique to each chemical, to each chemical element. >> Okay. >> And so there were-- some scientists were very excited to use the spectroscope to look at the eclipse. And in the chromosphere, they saw some lines from an element that they had never seen before. And they couldn t figure out what it was. So one of the scientists named it after the greek word for the sun-- helios. They named it helium. >> Oh! [ Laughter ] >> and it was several decades before helium was finally isolated and studied on the earth, but it was first discovered in the sun s atmosphere. >> How about that. That s-- is it called spectroscopy? >> Spectroscopy, yeah. They use a spectroscope for spectroscopy. >> Yeah, yeah, and studying the-- i guess there s little gaps in the light, and they look like gaps in the-- >> sometimes there s bright lines, sometimes there s dark lines. >> Okay. >> It depends on the situation. But the point is these lines are like a fingerprint. And that s how we understand the components of stars millions of lightyears away. We can-- >> so you said photosphere, and then you discovered the chromosphere, right? >> Chromosphere. >> So what s the difference between those? >> Well, the chromosphere is actually a very thin layer-- it s actually-- starts as cooler than the photosphere, and then it heats up again. >> Ooh. >> Solar astronomers are always trying to figure out the exact details, but what gets interesting is when you look up at the eclipse when it s total eclipse, there s what looks like a halo, or a garland, or a crown around it, and that s called the corona. So the chromosphere s a transition between the hot photosphere and the much hotter corona. And the corona is up to-- it s more than 100 times hotter than the photosphere. It s very, very hot. >> Wow. >> And that s, like i said, this halo that you see around the sun. That is actually very important-- to monitor that part of the sun-- in predicting solar storms. >> Oh. >> And solar storms affect things like satellites and our communication and our power systems. And so there are solar astronomers who are constantly monitoring the sun looking for these types of solar storms. But the corona was discovered by looking at eclipses. >> Wow. >> And in fact, it s so important that we ve launched satellites that create artificial eclipses. They put a little obstacle in the way so that we can monitor the chromosphere-- i m sorry, the corona-- at all times. >> So i guess, are they hard to predict, solar storms? >> They re getting better at it. The big thing is they need to be able to see on the far side of the sun. So we ve actually launched a couple of spacecraft called stereo, and they re now on the far side of the sun-- not totally-- they re part way around the earth s orbit, but they can see the other parts of the sun, and we can see storms developing as the sun rotates around. The sun actually rotates, also. >> Wow. So what happens if-- say there s an instance, if there s a solar storm, and it does disrupt satellite communications coverage, whatever it is. What can we expect if that were to happen? Are you talking about cell phones? Are you talking about-- what would happen here on earth? >> Well, one of the worst things we re worried about is a really, really big solar storm which could knock out power grids in certain areas. >> Wow. >> And so you could actually have power outages. >> That s heavy. >> But usually satellites, they put them in safe mode. But it can damage satellites. And as you know, telecommunications is a multi-million dollar business. >> Right. >> So there s a lot of interest in solar storms. >> But they have a safe mode to-- >> yep, that s right. >> That s amazing, okay. So they just put it in there if they see something bad coming. >> It s still dangerous, but they can put it in a safer mode. [ Laughter ] one other thing that was observed during eclipses is there s sometimes these little arcs-- they re not little-- they re bigger than the earth, but these little arcs of plasma jutting off the sun. And you ve probably seen pictures of them. They look like arches or flames coming off the sun. >> Yeah. >> They re called prominences, and they re plasma in the strong magnetic field of the sun moving through the atmosphere. And they re really quite spectacular. >> Yeah, i ve seen some images and videos of them-- they really are. It s amazing. >> Again, those were discovered by eclipses. And i ll tell you another set of experiments. It turned out that by the mid 1800s, scientists had started working out the mathematics of planets, and had noticed when a planet gets perturbed and sort of gets nudged a little bit, they said, well, that must mean another planet that s tugging on it with its gravity. And that s how neptune was discovered. They saw the perturbation in the motion of uranus. And they noticed that there was a slight perturbation in the orbit of mercury. So scientists began speculating that that was due to another planet even closer in to the sun, which they nicknamed vulcan. So what happened was they then sent-- in the 1860s and 1870s, scientists deployed around the world for some eclipses to try and look for vulcan. And they didn t find anything, which puzzled them. They looked at multiple eclipses, multiple times-- no vulcan. But in 1915, albert einstein began publishing-- began communicating his work on the general theory of relativity. And einstein had postulated that gravity is caused by the bending of spacetime. And one of his-- one of his-- one of the predictions of his theory was that you would see this perturbation of the orbit of mercury. So he explained that with his general theory of relativity. But another prediction was that this bending of spacetime would actually bend light. So he showed why there wasn t a vulcan, but then he said, if you look at an eclipse of the sun, and look at the light of stars very, very close to the disk of the sun, you should be able to see the light bent in a way that it displaces the apparent position of the star. In 1919, arthur eddington, the british astronomer, deployed for an eclipse out on an island in the atlantic ocean. And they actually measured this slight change in the apparent position of the stars. And it was a huge event, because when einstein postulated his theory of general relativity, it was crazy. It was overturning newton. And here they actually-- his prediction turned true, and that s sort of what propelled einstein into his fame, was that discovery. So that was perhaps the most important scientific discovery ever during an eclipse, was showing how the light of stars is bent by the presence of the mass of the sun. >> And that-- so it was just the mass of the sun. >> That's right. >> And there was no vulcan. >> No vulcan. [ Laughter ] although, there are two eclipse stories related, sort of quasi-related to the same thing there. >> But everything comes together, right? That s why we re-- like, going back to the general theme here, a lot of science to learn from eclipses. >> A lot of science. Let me talk about a couple things that are going on with the science this time around. >> Okay. >> We have one group that s going to have a series of telescopic cameras set up along the eclipse path. And they re going to try and take video of the inner corona, which is very difficult to see except during the eclipse. And the idea is one camera will record a little segment of the inner corona, and the next camera will record the next segment, and they can stitch them together and have a rather extended video of the corona. >> Oh. >> So for scientists who study the interaction of the corona. Another one is some other scientists are going to be studying the polarization. Some light is polarized in different directions that tells us information about the magnetic fields and other things. But they re going to be looking at the spectrum and the polarization of the-- again, the inner corona, which is difficult to measure in other ways, because it s difficult to get so close-- to measure such dim phenomena so close to the disk of the sun. >> And this is-- going back, i m sorry-- you might ve already addressed this, but these are nasa telescopes, or these are others? >> It s a variety of-- nasa s cooperating on some of these, and some of them are universities, and some of them are amateur. So it s actually a whole team of different kinds of people. >> Wow, okay. >> Nasa s helping to coordinate some of these. >> Yeah, all working together, okay. Cool. >> We ve got another group that are actually going to repeat the general theory of relativity experiment with some more modern digital equipment with more sensitive cameras to look for some very dim stars, again, to try and fine tune those measurements to see how close einstein got to the prediction. >> Wow. >> And then, we also have some radio enthusiasts who are-- during the daylight, the sun ionizes gas in the upper atmosphere and we have an ionosphere. And it, both enhances and sometimes interferes with radio communications. So these scientists are going to look at how the ionosphere changes as the sun gets eclipsed, and the sunlight starts to drop off, and then go back up again. So, they re going to observe how the ionosphere changes. >> Interesting. >> So lots of interesting experiments. And of course-- and many of these are by these amatuer citizen scientists, which is kind of a fun thing, too. >> Yeah, absolutely. So, we re measuring the earth s atmosphere, we re measuring a lot of about the sun. >> Mm-hmm. >> I know out of here, the wb-57, those high altitude planes, they re going to be flying above most of the atmosphere, about 90% of it, and they re going to take a look at the sun and study the sun s corona. >> Yeah, a bit. >> And measure how energy goes through the sun s atmosphere, but then also take a look at mercury. >> Oh, that s right. >> Yeah. >> I wanted to tell you, when you see the eclipse you will see a number of planets visible in the sky. >> Oh. >> So, if you get a chance, you ll see stars. Venus is off to the west, mars is even closer. It s-- venus is about 35 degrees to the west, mars is about 10 degrees to the west, mercury s about 10 degrees to the east, and jupiter s way over on the other side of the sky at 60 degrees to the east. And the star, regulus, which is a bright star, will be about 5 degrees to the east of the sun, so you can see if you can see that. >> And this will happen during totality, right? >> During totality, because the stars will come out. >> Wow, amazing. So you ll be able to see all of these, and you re talking about from the perspective if you re looking up and-- the sun-- >> right. >> Once it goes to totality-- and we can get to safety in a minute, but i do know, once it gets to totality you can take off your glasses for about that two minutes, right? >> That s right. Yeah. >> And then, that s when you ll be able to see all those different parts. >> Yes. >> That s really cool. >> Yeah, that s it. Let s talk a little about the history, because there s some interesting history, of course. >> Sure, yeah. >> The most famous story, which is probably legendary, but the story about a chinese astronomer, or possibly two chinese astronomers, named xi he, who was hired by the king. He was the high astronomer, the head astronomer. >> Mm-hmm. >> To make predictions about primarily with astrology to make sure that nothing bad was going to happen to the king. Well, apparently there was a solar eclipse he did not predict. >> Oh. >> And apparently, he had had a little too much to drink and he wasn t on the job when the time came. >> Oh. >> And the chinese actually thought, and a lot of ancient cultures thought, that something bad was happening. The chinese thought a dragon was swallowing the sun, and they would bang on pots and pans to scare the dragon away. And that s actually still practiced in many parts of the world, the bang on pots and pans. >> Yeah, they don t know the-- like, the science behind this total solar eclipse, so they re-- >> that s right. >> Yeah, right, go ahead. >> I think part of this tradition is passed on. >> Yeah, tradition, yeah. >> Well, unfortunately, this poor chinese astronomer that didn t do his job, he got executed. >> Oh. >> So, fortunately, we don t hold our scientists to this same level there. >> I m very thankful of that. >> Yes. >> I m sure we are. Yeah. >> But, lots of ancient people were scared of eclipses because they thought they-- i mean, it s a very amazing thing to happen in the sky and they were worried about it. It s warning of some tragedy. >> Mm-hmm. >> So early scientists in multiple cultures-- the mayans, the babylonians, the chinese-- studied eclipses and tried to understand and predict when they would occur. It turned out there was a greek by the name of thales who predicted an eclipse in 585 b.c. And this was recorded and the greek historian, herodotus, there was a big battle going on between two countries. There were the medes and the lydians, in what s now turkey. >> Hmm. >> And there was a war going on and they had lined up for battle. And they were about to do battle and suddenly there was a solar eclipse. >> Oh. >> Os, needless to say, the two generals met in the middle of the field and said, maybe we ought not to fight today. And so they drew up a peace treaty and those two countries never fought again. So just a-- >> all right. So an example of solar eclipse saving lives. >> That s right. Indeed, indeed. And so, but what happened was, a lot of these-- as people began to learn to write things down-- the babylonians on clay tablets, and the chinese court records, and the greek historians-- people began to pull together this information to understand how to predict eclipses and understand how the cycles occur. And that helped the-- that sort of spawned the whole science of astronomy. How do you-- how d the mathematics occur on these objects. >> Hmm. >> And one of the things they discovered was called the saros cycle, and this actually-- edmond halley named it the saros cycle. They didn t-- they had different names in ancient times. But what they discovered was that an eclipse will recur approximately every 6,585.3 days, which is 18 years, 11 days, and 8 hours. So it turns out that the eclipse we re about to have is part of a saros cycle that occurred-- the last one was in europe in august 11, 1999, and the next one will be in asia and the pacific one september 2nd, 2035. And it looks almost exactly the same except shifted by 8 hours around the other, 123 degrees in longitude. >> Oh. >> So these repeating cycles were how the ancients were able to predict eclipses. >> How about that. Wow. >> And it s just all the different cycles of the sun and the moon add up to this repeating cycle of eclipses. >> Interesting. >> Another thing that science that was done in ancient times was the greeks looked up at a lunar eclipse-- when we re talking about how the moon moves into the shadow of the earth. And what they discovered is when the moon is near the horizon and eclipsed the shadow of the earth is not a line, if the earth were flat. It s still round. So the greeks realized that the earth must be a sphere based on-- based on the shadow of the earth on the moon under an eclipse. >> Oh, wow. >> So that was the first scientific discovery that the earth was indeed a sphere. >> Back in the mayan-- wow, okay. >> Back in the greek times, that was. >> Oh, that was greek times. >> Yeah, it was. >> Okay, okay. Interesting. Wow! >> There s a lot of interesting history associated with eclipses. >> Absolutely. >> That-- so we ve learned a lot through history. I mean, we re talking about, yeah, the shape of the earth. We re talking about-- it stopped a battle. >> Nature of the sun, yeah. >> The nature of the sun. >> Yup. The earliest eclipse that was-- that, as far as we know, was recorded, that chinese eclipse was probably about 2000 b.c. And there was maybe the one in 2137 b.c. But, the one we re sure about was there was an eclipse recorded in the town of ugerit, or ugarit, on-- in what is now, i believe, syria. >> Hmm. >> It was may 3rd, 1375 b.c. It was recorded that the sun grew dark. >> Oh. >> So there s a number of those recorded in ancient texts and tablets. >> Okay. So, wait, so the chinese one was not recorded? It was just-- >> well, just know it s actually probably semi legendary. We re not sure. >> Got it, okay. >> But this is the one we know for sure we can date the eclipse. >> Yeah. >> And actually-- oh, that was what i was going to tell you, is we have a number of these dated eclipses-- eclipse of thales, we talked about. >> Mm-hmm. >> Eclipse in ugarit. And what happens if you just run-- if you just take your computer models and putting gravity and everything and just run the sun and moon backwards in time, it turns out the eclipse is in the wrong place. So, from that, what we ve learned is that the earth rotation very, very gradually starting to slow down. >> Hmm. >> Starting to, it s been a long time. It s mainly due to the tidal effects of the moon. It s actually dragging the earth slightly down. So it s actually in those several thousand years the earth has slowed down a little bit, a fraction of an-- a fraction of a rotation. >> Oh. >> But, keep in mind, we re talking about-- we re talking about 800,000 rotations or something like that since those times. And so, we ve-- the earth s rotation has changed just a little bit in those times. But, that s another discovery we ve made that you need that long time scale to see this very gradual slowing down of the earth s rotation. >> So, over that long period of time, you said a fraction of a day, is it like an hour? Couple of hours? >> A couple of hours i think, yeah. >> Wow. >> But, and recently, some scientists have gone back and looked at chinese records, and again, been able to fine tune that. So that s a-- that s using ancient records to fine tune some modern science, so. >> All right. Cool. Okay, so let s go to this eclipse coming up on the 21st. >> All right, do you want to talk about safety or what to expect? >> All of it. Let s do it. >> All right. All right, let s talk about-- >> however you want to start. >> Let s talk about safety a little bit. >> Okay, safety. >> Okay, everybody has heard, don t look at an eclipse, you ll go blind, right? We ve all heard that. >> Yeah. >> And i remember as a boy, puzzling and puzzling over that. What is it about an eclipse that makes it so dangerous? >> Mm-hmm. >> Well, it turns out, you don t want to stare at the sun ever. It s bad for your eyes. Your eyes are not designed to be-- handle direct sunlight for any length of time. >> I feel like it s a good general rule. >> It s a good general rule. And when our kids go outside, we say, now, kids, don t look at the sun, you ll go blind. It s true, you don t want them looking at the sun. >> Yeah, yeah. >> The reason why-- the eclipse is not any different. It s just you're more likely to stare at the sun during an eclipse because you want to see what s happening. >> Oh. >> So, this really-- there s people that think there is some sort of mysterious rays coming off the sun. The only thing is just the sun like we're normally familiar with, you just don t want to stare at it. Okay. >> Okay. >> All right, so that s the first thing. So any time the bright disk, that photosphere of the sun, any time the bright disk is visible, even just a little sliver, you really don t want to look at the sun with your unaided eye. It s dangerous. You want to keep your eye for a long -- your eyes for a long time, right? >> Yeah, i would hope so. >> But we have special-- nowadays, we have special eclipse glasses that you can get in museums and different places. >> Yeah. >> That are-- it s perfectly safe to put those on and look. By the way, don t do what i did. I was checking my eclipse glasses the other day. I looked up at the sun, i said, yeah. And i pulled the eclipse glasses off before i stopped looking at the sun, so then i had a bright blob. Just for a second, i had a bright blob in my eyes for a little while. So be careful with them. They re often made of aluminized mylar and they look-- they re kind of silvery. >> Okay. >> And also, don t put any pinholes or anything in them. That-- you want to-- you want to keep them like they are. >> Keep them-- so what are the special eclipse glasses? They have-- they re just like really intense sunglasses? Is that kind of what i think? >> Yeah, it s kind of super sunglasses. >> Okay. >> Which here s the thing, you want to avoid any homemade glasses. >> Oh. >> Don t put on multiple sunglasses or something. Don t use smoked glass, or photographic film, or neutral density filters, or anything like that. You re not sure there s enough there to block the light to make it safe. >> Okay. >> So stick with the-- with the-- with the kind that you can get. They re not very expensive and you can-- you can get them online and other places. >> Okay. >> One exception is number 14 welder s glass is safe, because that s designed also for very bright. Like the welders use. >> Oh, okay. >> All right, so that s okay. And the-- and even more important part is don t look at the sun-- don t look at the bright disk of the sun with any instruments, with telescopes or binoculars without proper filters on them, because those things actually magnify the strength of the sun. >> Ooh. They ll your-- >> and just like when i was a boy, i used to use the magnifying glass on the ants, you know? That could do that to your eye, so you need to be very, very careful. >> Yeah. >> So i would avoid-- i would avoid those, unless you have properly designed equipment. Now, don t like take your binoculars and put your sunglasses at the eyepiece, because it s so intense it could burn right through your special glasses. So there s-- be very, very careful unless you know what you re doing with binoculars and telescopes. Don t even use those. >> Right, and that s, again, that s only a two minute eclipse. >> It s only a two and a half minute at the most. >> Yeah. >> So, that s-- that little window of time during totality, after the moon has completely covered the disk of the sun-- >> mm-hmm. >> --That is the only time you can look safely without glasses. >> Okay. >> And it-- and the brightness of the-- of the eclipsed sun and the corona-- it s like the brightness of a full moon, so there s no dangerous rays. You just don t want to be staring at the sun when the sun re-emerges. So, okay. So, just good rules of thumb. >> So, when you re looking at it-- say you have the glasses on. >> Mm-hmm. >> Is there a specific amount of time that we can say is safe to have the glasses on and be looking at the moon about to cover the sun? >> Well, what s going to happen-- >> you don t want to stare at it for hours. >> No, no. Well, what you re probably looking for is as the sun-- as the very last piece of the sun starts to disappear, you ll see actually little dots that form, and those are called baily s beads. >> Hmm. >> And it s an interesting phenomena of what-- it has to do with the different brightnesses on the edge of the sun, and also the mountains on the moon. >> Mm-hmm. >> When those disappear, that s the time you can take your glasses off and-- so you don t want to be-- because that s actually tiny little pieces of the photosphere of the sun. >> Right. >> Oh, there s the other way-- if you don t have the glasses, there s some other ways you can look at-- and it s-- by the way, if you re seeing a partial eclipse, you just want to use the glasses. You don t want to look at the sun directly. >> Will you be able to see the moon partially covering the sun with the glasses? >> Yes, it ll look like a cookie with a bite taken out of it. >> How about that. That s cool. >> That s pretty cool. One method you probably heard of is a pinhole projector, and it s very easy to make. You need some opaque material, like cardboard, and you make a pinhole, and then you project onto like a white sheet of paper an image of the sun. A pinhole acts like a lens. And i think it s important, don t actually look through the pinhole with your eye. It s not intended to look inside. It s a projector. It s a little projector. >> You look at the paper. >> You look at the paper and you ll see a little image of the sun with that. And you can see the progress of the eclipse. Another method i used to do when i was in high school, is if you take a very small mirror or a large mirror with a piece of paper with a circular hole cut out, and you can reflect the image on the sun-- of the sun onto a shaded wall, and you can watch the eclipse that way. >> Oh. >> And i tell the story, i was in-- i was in history class when there was an eclipse of the sun when i was in high school, and i asked the teacher, i said, is it okay if i put this in the window and we can watch the eclipse during class time? The teacher said, okay. So we put it in the window and it put an image of the sun during the eclipse up on the ceiling. We just went along with class and you could watch the progress of the eclipse. >> All right. >> So those are-- so the mirror, there s the projector, or your glasses are the three ways to watch the eclipse. And then, the only time, again, to watch the sun-- watch the eclipse unaided is during totality, that little short period of time. >> Okay, and totality is by far the most narrow section of the u.s. >> That s right. >> So you really have to be in that spot and we-- you can go to the website eclipse2017.nasa.gov and find out exactly where that s going to be passing through. >> That s right. And it starts-- i think i started this, but it comes on the west coast. >> Oh, right. >> It arrives in oregon, it goes across oregon, idaho, wyoming, nebraska, missouri, kentucky, tennessee, south carolina. It s a nice path that goes right through the middle of the united states. >> All right. >> And it s a relatively narrow-- relatively narrow path and, of course, it s actually moving. It s a round shadow that s moving across the surface of the earth. >> Mm-hmm. >> And if you re actually anywhere in that band you will see a total eclipse. The closer you are to the center, the longer it will last. Up to a max of two and a half minutes. >> All right. >> The other thing though is the weather. >> Oh, yeah. >> Yeah. So, it turns out that what eclipse aficionados like to do is they ll look at the historical weather at that point in the u.s. At that time of year and it turns out some of the areas are more likely to have-- to have clouds than others. So it turns out, eastern oregon is a really good place. They tend to have nice clear weather at that time of year. >> Okay. >> Wyoming, nebraska, missouri, all the way to tennessee, tend to be pretty cloud free at that time of year. And then, there s another-- as it goes over the appalachians, they tend to be cloudier. And then the little section of south carolina will also have, hopefully, less clouds than other places. But again, you never know. It;s the weather. >> Yeah. Oh, yeah. >> All you can do is roll the dice and figure-- and hope that you re lucky, because if-- there have been many eclipses that people have gone-- scientists have gone specific trips to see and it s been interfered-- the weather interferes. >> Yeah, that s just-- yeah, poor luck. But that s based on data of this day over time at this place. >> That s right. How often has it been cloudy on this day at this place. >> Yeah, and so you re really rolling the dice, but playing the odds. But those based on statistical data are better off than others. >> Right. >> Very cool. Is there any particular spot during the path of totality that may be would be better? Like, for example, is it better to go to like a state park and be away from city lights or anything? Or is being in the city just as fine? >> It s just as fine. >> Okay. >> It doesn t get totality dark during an eclipse. >> Okay. >> It gets dark, but i don t think that s-- i don t think that part of it is particularly important. >> Okay. >> The main thing, it s actually much more practical, you want to be somewhere where you re close to restrooms. >> Okay. >> The eclipse itself lasts three hours and there may be a lot of traffic, so the ability to get around maybe limited. >> Ooh, yeah. >> So, just very practical things-- are you close to food> are you close to supplies? Things like that. >> Mm-hmm. >> So let s talk a little bit about what to expect. >> Yeah. >> As i said, there may be a lot of heavy traffic so you want to get to where you want to go early. >> Okay. >> And bring things that you re going to need-- your glasses-- your eclipse glasses, a camera if you re going to bring a camera, chairs, sunscreen, water, food, toilet paper, anything that you think you might need while you re on the road. >> Wow, yeah. >> I once had to evacuate here in houston during hurricane rita, and it s maybe a little bit like that and may be stuck on the road with heavy traffic if you re not careful. >> Wow! Are you talking about people stopping on the highway just to-- >> no, just talking about large numbers of people moving to see the eclipse. >> To see-- to be in the path of totality. >> If you re traveling-- for instance, i m going to be in the carolinas. >> Mm-hmm. >> And every eclipse watched on the atlantic coast is going to be headed for south carolina. >> Yeah. >> So the interstates are going to be pretty full. >> Wow. >> So just allow plenty of time. The total eclipse-- i mean, the entire eclipse lasts about three hours, so it s about an hour and a half leading up to totality and an hour and a half until the moon completely uncovers the sun. >> Okay, okay. >> But again, i-- and one of the things i thought was interesting was the eclipse veterans gave some very sage advice. They said, if this is your first eclipse, don t try to photograph it. Don t try to take telephotos of it. You ll be so worried about your camera, you ll miss the spectacular nature of the eclipse. So i think that s good advice. And so, if you re a veteran eclipse guy and you want to-- and you want to make photographs of things, that s fine. >> Yeah. >> Let the professionals do it. Just enjoy the experience. >> Yeah. >> I think that s a good idea. >> I m sure there s going to be plenty of imagery coming out from all over the u.s. >> Oh, there will. I bet there s going to be lots of selfies with people with the moon and the eclipsed sun behind them. But that s fine. >> Do you think selfies will come out, at least during totality? Maybe when it s dark enough it ll be okay. >> You may need a flash on yourself. >> Oh, okay. A flash on yourself, okay. >> A couple of suggestions to do, so a little citizen science you can do. >> Okay. >> One of them is, notice how the sky colors change. >> Hmm. >> They re very unusual colors that you don t normally see, so that s an interesting thing. Also, when there s a tree casting shadows, there are lots of little tiny holes between the leaves that act like pinhole cameras. So sometimes you can see little crescent suns during the partial eclipse on the ground. So you can look for that. It s kind of fun to take pictures of that. >> Oh, that s really cool. >> Does the temperature change? Does it feel cooler during the eclipse? Does the wind pick up or calm down during the eclipse? Just some kind of scientific things you can observe. >> Just is there-- are there things that we know of that-- what atmospheric changes in the earth? Like-- >> it will-- it does change the heating of the earth from the sun. >> Oh, it does? >> Yeah, and you will feel colder. And people actually have noticed it feels considerably cooler, which will be pleasant probably on august 21st, especially in south carolina. So just things to notice. Again, the other thing is as totality approaches observers have sometimes noticed what s called shadow bands, and these are alternating light and dark bands that quickly move across the ground, especially where you have light colored surfaces. >> Hmm. >> They occur just before totality and after totality. They re-- actually, we don t fully understand how they work. They probably have something to do with the atmosphere, the same reason the stars twinkle. But if you can see them-- sometimes they re seen, and sometimes they re not. Something to look for. >> Hmm. >> Another thing to observe is right a s the totality is beginning, there s just a tiny little sliver of the sun, and it looks very much like a diamond ring in the sky, and it s called the diamond ring effect. And that s definitely when the diamond ring occurs at the end of the eclipse. So the baily s beads-- that s the time to put your sunglasses-- your special eclipse glasses back on. >> Oh, okay. >> But, as the eclipse is about to happen you ll see the diamond ring effect, and then the diamond will go away, the baily s beads will go away, and then you ll see the full totality. And again, you can take your eclipse glasses off during totality, but be ready to put them back on. >> Yeah. >> And another thing you can look around is take a moment-- while you re enjoying the eclipse, take a moment to observe people around you. See how people react to it. >> Yeah. >> The expressions on their face. Another thing, is sometimes animals behave strangely during eclipses. >> Chicken shave been known to roost, birds behave differently. Even wasps and bees sometimes behave strangely. >> Wow. >> Cows, insect-- dogs, insects, anything you can think of that s close by, just for fun, observe and see if you notice anything. >> It is a strange and rare phenomenon to them. >> It is strange and they re confused by it. >> Yeah, yeah. >> And by the way, after totality, the whole sequence will reverse it. So you have all those sequence of things, the partial eclipse, the diamond ring, the baily s beads. >> Mm-hmm. >> And that will reverse as the moon uncovers the sun. >> Wow. Amazing. >> So if you miss this eclipse, or the weather doesn t cooperate, we have another chance in 7 years from now. >> All right. >> In 2024, there will be an eclipse that will move through texas and up through new england, and it will be another total eclipse of the sun. So we have two in a very short period of time, but it s been a long time since we ve had an eclipse. >> All right, yeah. >> So, we re due. We re due. We get two-- so, two chances, and my wife said, well, why don t we just go to the one in 7 years? And i said, well, we don t know what our lives are going to be like in 7 years. >> Yeah. >> So i said, carpe eclipsum. Seize the eclipse. So this is your chance. >> Fantastic. Yeah, no, i mean, i m-- if anything, why not both, right? >> Well, why not? We can try both. I may become an eclipse junkie, i guess. >> Yeah, yeah. No, i mean, it s so cool. And the fact that we re able to predict them, and we can go and-- we have a bunch of best practices on how you can observe the eclipse, the best that you can possibly do it. >> Yeah. >> I know, going back, just one quick thing. Well, you said early. Arrive to your destination early. >> Yeah, if you can, yes. >> How early are you-- are you talking about like days, or day, or hours? >> Well, it s difficult to arrive days early now, because virtually every hotel is booked along the eclipse path. >> Oh. >> We re going to be some distance away from the eclipse, so we re going to have to start early. The eclipse is maximum in south carolina about 2:30, so i figure if we get off at 8:00 in the morning that gives us about 6 hours to get there. And that may or may not be enough time. We ll just have to do the best we can. That was just where we-- i m staying with relatives, so that s-- >> okay. >> But, a lot of people i know have their hotel rooms booked in the-- at-- underneath the eclipse, so they can just step outside and watch it. >> Yeah, that s the-- oh, i wish i planned ahead there. That would ve been nice just get a nice, like, resort or something and just lay by the pool, watch the eclipse go by. That d be pretty cool. >> Actually, what i had originally planned-- i ve been planning for this eclipse since i was in graduate school many, many years ago. >> Wow. >> And i noticed that it would actually go through grand teton national park. And i thought, that s what i ll do. I ll go to the grand tetons and see the eclipse. But it turns out, the weather s not so-- it s a higher probability of clouds there, so i backed away from that. >> Wow. >> Good luck to those of you that-- the tetons. But that would be a beautiful photograph, actually, to see the eclipse over the grand tetons. >> Oh, absolutely. Let s keep our fingers crossed for that good weather all across the board. >> Hopefully it ll be clear all across the united states. >> Yeah. >> And everybody will be able to enjoy the eclipse. >> That would be fantastic. Well, i think that s all the time we have, unless you have one more story. But-- anything? >> I have other stories, but-- there are lots of good stories. >> Well, hey, yeah. Actually, we have a website and if you stay tuned until after the music here, we ll tell you where you can go and check out some more info on the eclipse and learn a little bit more about the history, the science, and all kinds of cool stuff, including the citizen science that mark was talking about here and how you can-- what you can do to observe some phenomena about this eclipse. So stay tuned for after the music there. Mark, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today. >> You re welcome. >> I feel like that was-- i m not going to say everything about the eclipse, because like you said, there s definitely more. But that s the-- i feel like i have a good understanding about eclipses and the science that goes behind it. So there s a lot about eclipses and a lot that we can learn just from shadows, and it s just amazing that there s so much behind it. So thanks for coming on the podcast and talking all about it. And everyone, i hope you enjoy the eclipse on the august 21st. So thanks again, mark. >> Thank you. [ Music ] >> houston, go ahead. >> I m on the space shuttle. >> Roger, zero-g and i feel fine. >> Shuttle has cleared the tower. >> We came in peace for all mankind. >> It s actually a huge honor to break the record like this. >> Not because they are easy, but because they are hard. >> Houston, welcome to space. >> Hey, thanks for sticking around. So, once again, this monday, august 21st, a total solar eclipse will sweep across america. If you want to know all the information that we have, if this podcast was not enough for you, go to eclipse2017.nasa.gov. You can find out all the science of eclipses, even more than we talked about with mark matney today, where it will be, and then how to safely view it from the ground. Just be sure to make sure that you check the glasses and make sure that they are nasa certified. After talking with mark matney after the show, we found out that the shadow itself is going to be 68 miles wide, and then that shadow travels faster than 1,000 miles per hour. So, he went back and he was trying to find the width of the shadow. It s actually a little bit smaller than you would imagine, but how fast it travels-- i mean, we re talking about some of those planes that are going to be following the shadow and studying it, they re only going to get only a few extra minutes out of it because the shadow s traveling so fast. But, if you think about it, it s the moon going around the earth, so it s probably going to be a little bit faster than you would think. Anyway, you can find out more about the eclipse by following us on social media. Obviously, our nasa accounts will be talking about this, but also here at the nasa johnson space center you can follow our accounts there. We ll be talking about it. If you follow international space station you can see some of the imagery. You ll get from there 250 miles above the earth. And then also, aries astral materials research, you ll find them on multiple accounts and you can talk-- they will be talking mostly about the science of eclipses, and they are also based here in the johnson space center. All of these are on either facebook, twitter, and instagram. If you want to join the conversation for-- and maybe submit some pictures that you are taking from wherever you re going to be observing the eclipse, and then also sort of see what everyone else is doing, the official hashtag for this event is #eclipse2017. Just use that on your favorite platform and share your experience and maybe ask a couple questions in case all of the information we told you today and anything you can t find on the website we can still answer even more questions that you have. So this podcast was recorded on july 19th, 2017. Thanks to alex perryman, john stoll, and tracy calhoun. And thanks again to dr. Mark matney for coming on the show. We ll be back next week.",

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host):  \"Houston We Have a Podcast.\"  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 66, 5,000° Fahrenheit.  I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today.  On this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, and astronauts, all to let you know the coolest information about what's going on right here at NASA.  So today, we're discussing Orion, the vehicle that will take humans out into deep space.  Specifically, we're talking about how Orion deals with serious temperatures.  It might not be super-apparent, but it has some serious swings out in space.  In sunlight, structures can be exposed to temperatures as high as 500 degrees Fahrenheit, minus 150 in the shade.  And that's just out in space.  When Orion comes screaming back into Earth's atmosphere at 25,000 miles per hour, the heat shield will have to protect the spacecraft and, more importantly, the astronauts inside from temperatures around 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit.  That's twice as hot as molten lava and half as hot as the Sun.  Discussing this topic is Ronny Baccus, Orion structures and thermal protection system functional area manager.   We go into how Orion is designed to handle all of this and keep the astronauts safe from intense heat.  So with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with Mr. Ronny Baccus.  Enjoy.    [ Music ]    Host: Well thank you for coming on the podcast today, Ronny.  We really appreciate your time.    Ronny Baccus: Oh, thanks Gary.  Glad to be on.    Host: So we've had guests that talked about Orion before but we haven't gone specifically into this, into what it takes to withstand serious temperatures -- I mean, high temperatures, especially during reentry, which we'll get into, but also just temperature swings, of being in space and the difference that it takes with deep space travel.  We talked a little bit about it on the Space Station, but Orion is kind of a different beast.  So let's just start with kind of just -- kind of set the scene.  Just overall, what do we know so far about the temperature of space?  Because I don't think it's -- you don't really think of that, like if you're watching a space movie, you see someone just kind of floating out in space, right?  You don't really realize the temperature swings, especially in and out of the Sun.  So what do we know so far?    Ronny Baccus: Well, let's see.  So we're talking about in space temperatures.    Host: Yeah.    Ronny Baccus: And the temperature swings that you get on orbit vary quite a bit, right?  And really, what I'm talking about, the temperatures that you see in space, there's kind of two phases that are important to consider.  One is just the on-orbit environment.  Once you get up, you know, out of the atmosphere and you're in orbit around the Earth either on the way to the Moon or somewhere, then you've got a thermal management problem that you have to maintain, that you have to manage, okay?  And there are a wide range of temperatures that you -- that the spacecraft will see while it's in orbit or in space.  Then you also, of course, have the energy associated with the thermal environment for the reentry phase, right, at the end of the mission, which of course the Space Station doesn't have to deal with.  So those are kind of two distinct but related problems to solve, okay?  And so, on our team, so in my role as the Orion manager of the structure of the spacecraft and also the thermal protection system, we deal with the heat shield primarily and then the backshell, which I'll get into what that is.   But basically the external shielding to protect the spacecraft and the occupants, of course, from the reentry environment.  But the larger spacecraft, in its entire mission, we have to manage that temperature obviously from start to finish.  We have several teams that are engaged and work together, you know, to kind of hand off that responsibility depending on the mission phase.  And so getting back to your question about, you know, once you get up into space, let's take low Earth orbit, just as a starting point.    Host: Okay.    Ronny Baccus: And you will see, you know, when you're on the side that's -- when you're facing the Sun, obviously you're getting all that thermal energy.  The surface temperatures -- we talk about the temperature of space but the really important thing is what the temperature of the spacecraft is getting when it's exposed to that solar radiation.  And so you can see temperatures as high as, you know, 500 degrees or so on the surface and then you come around on the backside or if you're just in the shade, then there's a very steep gradient where it drops down to, you know, minus 150 or so at the coldest point.   And temperature varies throughout the, you know, all over the spacecraft surface.  It's a distribution.  It's a function of what materials you choose, what the optical properties of the outer surface are and how much light and solar energy get reflected, how much gets absorbed -- all of those are important design considerations in managing how much heat is coming into the spacecraft and also how much heat is going out of the spacecraft, right?  In the terms of the crew inside, you know, we like to keep a nice room temperature, you know, short sleeve environment for them.  And so it's as much about making sure it doesn't get too cold or too hot, right?  So when you're going in orbit, you have these temperature swings in low Earth orbit 16 times a day, you know?  Every 90 minutes you're going around.  Host: Yeah.    Ronny Baccus: And so that is a design consideration that has to be accounted for.  Once you're in transit to, let's say talk about the missions to the Moon, upcoming EM missions for Orion for example or for Apollo, they didn't have temperature swings that frequently but you had to account for the fact of which side is facing the Sun? Which side is in shadow?  And account for what that does to the spacecraft in the design.    Host: Yeah, that's right.  So when you talk about orbital, you're thinking about the Earth having one side mostly facing towards the Sun.  That's where you're getting those positive temperatures, those really, really hot temperatures.  It's really the Sun and what maybe the lack of an atmosphere really that's not protecting you against those extreme temperatures.  So the sunshine's.    Ronny Baccus: Right, you're getting that direct radiation.    Host: Exactly.  So the Sun is shining on the side of the structure.  That structure is heating up to 500 degrees.  And then on the shade side, yeah, pretty darn cold, negative 150.  That's not a brisk winter, that's something else.  So what -- how do you -- I guess we'll start with what materials -- what kind of materials you need to think about in the way that a spacecraft is designed to deal with that?    Ronny Baccus: So when you're trying to manage the temperatures that you have in the spacecraft, you know, you have to look at, you know, maybe the surface temperature is one thing and it's also the how does that temperature, that thermal energy, transmit inside to the components that you really care, right?  The crew, obviously.    Host: Oh yeah.    Ronny Baccus: And any other components that are sensitive to temperature.  And so that's managed through, I mean, the primary structure of the spacecraft, typically the materials that we select for, you know, on-orbit temperatures aren't primary drivers for the design of the structure itself.  The materials can typically handle that.  We have carbon composite materials.  We have, you know, other high-temperature materials and metals in the spacecraft.  Those are -- those do have temperature limits.  We have a layer -- typically what we'll do, like take for example the Orion crew module and Apollo had this as well.  We put an external layer of basically it's a Kapton tape or a film that has very specifically chosen optical properties so that you're minimizing how much thermal energy is coming -- you know, you're reflecting a lot of that energy back out into space, or if it's reaching a certain amount of energy or temperature, then it will emit some of that energy off just as part of its natural physical properties.   And so that's a very important parameter that is defined.  And then once the analysts who have done all of the thermal modeling and analysis -- they've defined, well, here's what we need so that we can maintain the environment that we need inside.  Then that drove the decision for the specific material or the Kapton tape -- basically like tape.  It looks like aluminum foil and there's different variations of it, and pick the one that works best for our mission.    Host: So really, it's -- when you say optical, that's kind of the reflective component to it.  Literally, if you want to get rid of some of the heat, you're going to reflect it -- reflect that sunlight.    Ronny Baccus: Right, right.    Host: Okay.  So that actually has a serious effect then on getting rid of some of that heat from the Sun?    Ronny Baccus: Sure.  And certainly, you still have those temperatures.  Some of that heat will still conduct in.  But actually, when you're on orbit, the bigger challenge is cooling, right?  Even though you may have one side that's facing the Sun, like for the Orion crew module as the example, the real driver is making sure that the heat that's inside the crew module doesn't drop too much because that conduction path goes both ways.  So you can have the heat start to conduct out to the surface and radiate out from those outer layers, so we had to kind of strike a balance between making sure we have the right range of temperatures inside.  We control -- we have systems that will monitor the temperature inside and will -- you know, if we need to activate heaters to offset that to some amount, we will.  That was part of a factor that drove the selection of the outer layer, for example.   This is an integrated problem where if it's radiating too much out or if the -- if it's emitting or the emissivity is the primer that we're interested in is too high, that can drive how much heater power that you have to provide to keep the temperature inside what you need.  Well then that draws more power from the electrical system and then there's a ripple effect, right?  So we have to look at this from a systems engineering problem to make sure the choices that we make work for the vehicle as a whole.    Host: Yeah, it's a chain reaction.  So you're talking about not only from the outside, thinking about the temperature of the Sun coming and hitting the spacecraft, now the inside, you want to maintain that temperature.  So, as a summary, is it in the colder temperatures in the shade you have -- you want to make sure that heat is more contained and that it's not escaping?  That's really what it comes down to.  Okay, so you're constantly thinking about that.    Ronny Baccus: That actually turns out to be more of the design driver.    Host: Really?    Ronny Baccus: Yeah.    Host: Okay -- well, the crew, right?  You want to protect the crew.    Ronny Baccus: Right, absolutely.    Host: Do you find yourself fighting with the power guys who want to face the solar arrays a certain way but have thermal constraints on the structure of the vehicle?    Ronny Baccus: So we do consider, you know, what is the overall spacecraft pointing needs, the solar arrays can obviously point us in whatever direction is most favorable.    Host: Oh, there you go.    Ronny Baccus: Particularly when you're in transit.  For the most part, you'll be tail to Sun.  Like if you're going from the Earth to the Moon on the Orion spacecraft, primarily you're going from the Earth to the Sun.  So you kind of have that study sunlight on one side and that's -- you know, we're drawing power from the solar arrays and we're able to have an integrated solution that doesn't violate any thermal constraints that we have for the spacecraft while still generating the power that we need.    Host: There you go.    Ronny Baccus: And there are factors as you go.  Depending on what phase of the mission you're in, you may need to do an attitude adjustment to change how you’re pointing of the spacecraft or the solar arrays.    Host: Yeah.  So we should probably go back and address the fact that this Orion spacecraft is -- the first few missions, we're planning on going to the Moon, right?  We're going to go around the Moon.  That's where the vehicle is going to be tested.  We have some knowledge from going to the Moon before.  The Apollo capsule had humans that went to the Moon and have kind of a similar profile, you know?  You're launching, you're going around the Earth and then, bam!  Translunar injection to the Moon.  What do we know from some of those missions, learning from past experiences on how to deal with going to the Moon and the thermal constraints there?  And then coming back too, especially with reentry?    Ronny Baccus: Right, right.  Yeah, certainly the Orion spacecraft has -- genealogy can trace back to [Apollo] in many areas.  We definitely have looked at that design and the lessons learned and the leverage that experience base in informing the design choices that we make, what works best for Orion.  There are some differences, certainly.  Orion didn't -- I mean, pardon me, the Apollo had fuel cells on board to generate the electrical power rather than solar arrays, which Orion has.    Host: Ah, okay.    Ronny Baccus: There are pros and cons with that.  The benefits of solar arrays is that basically the sustained power that you can get for long-duration missions.  [Apollo] had fuel cells so they didn't necessarily have the same attitude constraints that would be associated with solar array pointing than we would have for Orion.  Just as one example, there were a number of lessons learned if we talk about reentry in particular.  The heat shield that [Apollo] had, we did a lot of research in looking at the Orion design and determining what is the most -- what would be the most effective and efficient heat shield for reentry for the missions that we're looking at?  Of course, we have this experience base with Apollo and the system that was developed during that program, and the material systems that were a part of that is a material called AVCOAT.   It was developed during the '60s.  We are maintaining a lot of that knowledge -- corporate knowledge within the agency -- and have applied that to the Orion spacecraft because it works very well.    Host: There you go.    Ronny Baccus: For lunar returns.    Host: So what's AVCOAT?    Ronny Baccus: So AVCOAT is a material system that is used to -- it's basically the outer layer.  So if you're looking at the spacecraft, whether you're looking at Apollo or the Orion crew module, basically the outer layer of the heat shield that you see before you put this thin film of Kapton on that I mentioned earlier is the AVCOAT material.  That's your primary barrier that protects the crew module from the hostile environment of the reentry trajectories that we'll fly.  It's a material that will shed heat as you reenter the atmosphere.  The temperature goes up, you get up to the surface temperature of about 5000 degrees Fahrenheit.  On the back side, these -- this is probably, depending on where you are on the heat shield, it's an inch or two inches thick.   By the time you get to the layer where it's attached to the internal structure, it's no more than a few hundred degrees, right?  So it's very effective at isolating heat from the areas that you need to protect and not exceeding any temperature limits.  And the way it works is, as the heating is increased, then you get these chemical reactions that happen at the surface that's taking the brunt of the reentry environment.  And you have these, basically these small particles that will start to be liberated from the surface as that heat increases.  What that does is you're taking -- small amounts of mass are leaving or eroding off of the heat shield.  It's taking heat with it.  And so that's a way -- it's basically dumping the heat as it's applied, or dumping it overboard into the wake of the spacecraft as it flies in the reentry and that is very effective at controlling how much remaining thermal energy makes its way into the spacecraft.    Host: Wow!  So literally -- you said it's about an inch-thick, right?  And it's just -- it's meant to burn away?    Ronny Baccus: Right.    Host: And that's how it protects?  You're literally -- the heat comes and you just throw it off the back, huh.    Ronny Baccus: Right.  I think at the hottest spot on the heat shield, it's called the stagnation point, and that's basically where you're hitting the wind stream basically head-on, 90 degrees.  That's the taking the brunt of it.  I think in that location it's about two inches thick at its thickest.   Host: Okay  Ronny Baccus: And as you get to regions where the heating is reduced, that thickness will taper that down to only be as thick as it needs to be with the appropriate amount of margin.    Host: Right.    Ronny Baccus: So that was a system that was developed in the '60s, just at the fundamental material level.  We did a very extensive trade study at the beginning of the Orion program to evaluate a number of different candidate materials to determine which one would be the most effective for our use and AVCOAT was one of the contenders -- and went through a lot of testing and analysis to determine what's the best fit.  And for our purposes, the physics are really the same as they were back then and it really is a robust system that is very effective at what we're doing.   The shape of the crew module, certainly for those that are -- have some familiarity with the Orion spacecraft, it looks very similar to the Apollo capsule design.  It's a larger spacecraft in general, but the shape is the same essentially.   Host: Yeah.    Ronny Baccus: So it flies through the atmosphere in the same way.  The curvature of the heat shield is the same, just scaled up.  And it's the curvature of these blunt-body capsules inherently provides you an additional level of thermal control, if you will.  And the way it does that is that as you're pushing through the atmosphere, it creates this shockwave in front.  There's this bow wave in front.  And as you get farther away from the heat shield and get into where that shock-layer is, the temperatures are much higher than 5,000 -- we were talking about 5,000 degrees being very hot, they're many thousands of degrees hotter than that.   You get to temperatures of the Sun kind of temperatures.  You never want that flow to actually directly attach to the heat shield, right?  You'll immediately have a problem.    Host: Right.    Ronny Baccus: So the shape of the capsule is very important in keeping that shockwave offset from the spacecraft.    Host: Huh!    Ronny Baccus: And so then you have -- and so the heating environment that's inside that shockwave is much less.  It's \"only\" 5000 degrees on the surface.  So that -- so then we have to manage that surface temperature in terms of how the heat shield system itself will reject the heat and minimize heat conduction so that by the time you get to the bondline where the heat shield material is bonded to the structure, it's at most allowed to get to about 500 degrees again like we talked about before, by the time you get to splashdown, right?  And so then we just changed the thickness of the blocks depending on where you are so that you're always protecting that temperature limit inside the structure.    Host: Yeah, wow!  I didn't think about that.  Upon reentry, there are higher temperatures than 5,000 degrees, which is absurd to think about in the first place.  But just the shape of the vehicle and the way that it's designed protects the vehicle itself from those temperatures just based on physics.    Ronny Baccus: Right.    Host: Wow!  Okay.    Ronny Baccus: Yeah, and you think about how much energy there is and you watch the vehicle, you know, a vehicle that's bound for the Moon launch on a -- it's got to be on a big rocket.  There's a lot of energy that is expended to be converted into the kinetic energy or the velocity required to get all the way out to the Moon and all the way back.  Well, we still have that energy, it's in the system, it's just in a different form.  And we have to slow down to, you know, levels that are within the range of what the parachutes can take over from and all of that energy dissipation is done through just dissipating it through thermal dissipation, I guess from the heat shield primarily.  And so you've got all this work that's done.  As you're pushing through the atmosphere, you're reducing the velocity as you're pushing all these hot gases away and out in front of this shockwave.  And then energy of just liberating this material from the AVCOAT system to carry the heat away and minimize how much heat is coming in.    Host: Yeah.    Ronny Baccus: And by the time you get down low enough, if we've done our job right, you're nice and starting off let's say 25,000 miles an hour at the start, and by the time you get down in the lower atmosphere, you're maybe 1,000 miles an hour or so, a little bit less.  You're within range of where the parachute system would then start to take over.    Host: Okay, yeah.  The atmosphere is a great kind of way to slow down.    Ronny Baccus: Right.    Host: So the heat shield -- it's designed, if you're thinking about this capsule shape, it's designed to take that heat.  It's designed to withstand the 5000 -- or sort of withstand it.  It's supposed to kind of shed it and -- but on the other side, that doesn't have a heat shield as well and the reason is just because of the shape, because a lot of the heat is on this side.  So what's happening on the other side as the temperature's within that 500 degree?    Ronny Baccus: So on the back side, where the conical portion of the capsule -- so the temperatures are much lower back there because you're in the wake of the spacecraft as it's plowing through the atmosphere.  But we still have to provide thermal protection back there.  And this is a case where, for the Orion vehicle, we've leveraged our experience with shuttle and actually have an array of -- very similar to the shuttle tile system back there.  So the temperatures back there, you know, 1600 degrees Fahrenheit on the surface roughly, you know, it varies depending on location, but that's within range of what a tile system could do.  So we put these blocks on there in typical fashion and that provides the protection that we need for the back shell.    Host: And then you said there's tape on top of that?    Ronny Baccus: Then on top of that, we put the layer of the Kapton tape, the shiny metallic, looks like aluminum foil.  It's the very thin layers on the outside and then that gets us back to the optical properties that we need to help manage the thermal environment when we're in orbit.  So it all ties together -- the system.    Host: Yeah.  So having the sort of reflective tape on top to -- when you're out in space, that's going to be reflecting a lot of the heat because the tile itself is black, right?  And you don't want black tiles when you're out in space, right?  That's going to absorb too much heat.  So then what's the heat shield made out of?  If there's these tiles up top, what's underneath this AVCOAT?    Ronny Baccus: So underneath the AVCOAT, then you're getting into the primary structure of the vehicle.  And so the heat shield is basically a giant dish.  It's a composite -- carbon-composite material.  So it's fabricated.  You basically have these layers of these plies of material that you can lay -- and think of like fiberglass in a boat, right?  They will lay these layers in at different angles.  The fibers come in these rolls of -- it's basically like a roll of -- think of like a roll of carpet or something, two-feet wide or something.  And you lay it down in these strips and you build up these layers, you know, 40, 50 plies thick.  And then that goes into an oven or an autoclave and that cooks it.  And then all the resin and everything that's in that system will harden and then you've got a structure that's stiff and strong and can handle the loads at splashdown, can handle the aerodynamic pressure during reentry and all the other load cases that we have to deal with.   So that's the primary skin that the AVCOAT is bonded to.  Then there's some supporting members inside that made out of titanium that provide additional stiffness and then they attach points to the rest of the crew module.    Host: Oh, okay.  Yeah, because the heat shield not only has to deal with heat but you're talking about a lot of other factors too that you have to test.    Ronny Baccus: Right.  Yeah, it's an integrated problem for sure because, you know, the thermal environment -- and obviously managing and discarding the heat as you're coming into the atmosphere is a key part of it -- but you do see temperature differences internal to the structure.  You also have to consider this in space where, if you have materials that are made from -- or if you have structural elements that are made of different materials, they may expand and contract a little bit differently from each other.  And if they're attached together, then that will induce some stresses in the structure that we have to make sure we design for and account for.  So that's all part of the analysis and testing that we do to ensure that we understand how the design works as an integrated system.    Host: That's right.  Because you have all these issues to solve so you just have to make sure that your solutions are going to not only solve them but then work together.    Ronny Baccus: Right, exactly.    Host: Wow!  So this -- it sounds like the heat shield this is just a solid piece, like you described it as a dish.  Is that how the Apollo heat shield was as well?    Ronny Baccus: The Apollo design was a little bit different.  The structure was different.  They had a -- it was basically a metallic honeycomb -- they call it a honeycomb sandwich panel.  So if you were to look at a cross-section of it, you'd see a very thin sheet of steel and then you'd have this honeycomb material in between.  And then on the other side, you'd have another layer of steel is what they had for Apollo, at high-temperature capability.  So that's very stiff.  The reason for the honeycomb structure is to take some of the weight out.  If it was just a solid material, it would be very heavy.  You wouldn't be able to lift it off the pad.  And so you can separate these two sheets, make them very thin, put this honeycomb material in between, and then you get a nice, stiff structure.   Host: Okay.  Ronny Baccus: We use similar versions of that design for, like, the backshell panels on the conical section. We use composites instead but we use -- the sandwich construction is very efficient for handling load.  It wasn't the best fit for the Orion heat shield.  The size of the dish made it more efficient for us to just basically make a single skin and then reinforce it with some metallic beams inside -- stiffeners.  That was a more efficient solution for our size.  It's one of those things -- when you look at the Apollo design, the Apollo design is a 12 1/2 or so feet diameter heat shield.  The Orion vehicle is larger.  It's 16 1/2 feet or so in diameter.  It's the largest heat shield of its kind.  You can't just take the old design and, you know, scale up everything as it was on the Apollo drawings and have it necessarily work, right?  There are other things that come into play with scaling up.  And so we made a decision to have a different structural configuration that worked better for the size that we were going to be using in terms of its ability to be manufactured.  And so that drove the structural differences.   The AVCOAT material itself is very similar to Apollo.  The biggest difference in the Orion design now is in how the architecture of the system -- and what I mean by that is the -- if you look at the Apollo design, if you're familiar with the Apollo design, you have this -- so you have this structure, the sandwich structure that I mentioned.  And then bonded to the outside of that is another layer of honeycomb material.  And it's open cell.  So if you were to -- and you can go over -- if you ever go over to Space Center Houston and look at the crew module that they've got over there of the Apollo 17 vehicle, you can see the individual cells.  It looks like a honeycomb.  I mean, you see these little cells -- kind of the pattern is on the outer surface of the heat shield.    Host: Cool.    Ronny Baccus: Now there's a lot of manual touch labor that's involved with a design like that.  So the way they did it was they had this honeycomb.  It was open cell material and then they had a -- think of like a -- almost like a glorified caulking gun.  And they had a technician manually inject every single little cell to cover the entire spacecraft with this AVCOAT material in its uncured form, so it's like a paste.    Host: Okay.    Ronny Baccus: Okay and then, once they get every cell filled up, they put it in the oven and cook it.  Then after it's cured, fully cured, then it's ready for flight.  It's got the properties that we need to then ablate.  We started with that design for Orion as well.  So in fact, the EFT-1 mission that flew back in December of 2014, we started with that design as well.  So we had the, you know, much larger heat shield.   We had this honeycomb system and, same process basically, injected every single -- so there's like 300,000 of these individual cells.    Host: Ah, so fun!    Ronny Baccus: On the heat shield that was then cured.  What we've learned from that is, as part of the scaling up process, is that there are some challenges in terms of manufacturing that design presented us with.  So, once we cured the entire heat shield, we saw some cracks had formed in certain areas -- not desirable to have cracks on a heat shield, right?    Host: No!    Ronny Baccus: And so the good news is we had repair methods that did have, you know, Apollo heritage that we could employ to basically fill those cracks.  We had a series of plugs that were applied to fill in all of these cracks and we got a nice heat shield out of it, had a very successful flight and the heat shield performed beautifully.  It was amazing.   Host: Cool.    Ronny Baccus: But it was an experience that kind of led us to think about, well maybe there's an opportunity here to evolve the design a little bit.  And so we were looking at other programs and other experiences that we had with block heat shield systems that have flown since Apollo.  An example of this would be some of the Mars probes that have flown, like the MSL mission, you know, a few years ago.  They had basically a block system that you cure the individual blocks of a blader into these chunks of maybe two inches or -- I'm sorry, two feet by two feet or so in size.   And then you can -- and then you basically bond those on a piece at a time.  And so the advantages of that is that the amount of touch labor is reduced, so trying to be good stewards of the taxpayer dollar.  The cost comes down in terms of production, but it also got us away from some of these failure modes that were kind of an inherent with this honeycomb system, to get some more reliability out of it.  And the reason that that's helpful is with the honeycomb design, you basically had to build the entire heat shield and then you cured it all at once. And then you kind of found out at the end, how did it turn out?  You know, did the cake bake the way we planned?  And with the block system now where if you can make these the AVCOAT in these individual pieces, you can cure them separately and you can do an inspection of each block and say, oh, this is a good block, let's bond it onto the spacecraft.   Oh, this one's got a flaw in it or this has an issue -- throw it out, right?  So it allows us to kind of screen out as we go and get some efficiency out of the system and get some confidence in that, as we are building up the heat shield, that we're going to have a system that's going to work for us.  So there's a combination of, you know, looking for ways to take what we've learned from Apollo and not lose that benefit because the material is very effective at what it does, but look for opportunities to enhance its performance and its ability to, you know, from a practical perspective, from manufacturing and getting costs down and other things that is working well for us now.  That's one of the key things looking forward that we're going to be looking for on this EM-1 mission, which is our next flight, is a flight demonstration of this block version of the AVCOAT system.    Host: Okay.  There you go.  Well, that's the wonderful thing about testing, right?  So EFT-1 kind of revealed, well, maybe let's reinvestigate this honeycomb thing, and now you've got the blocks.  So we're going to try that out.  That's wonderful.    Ronny Baccus: Exactly.    Host: Yeah, thinking about more efficient ways of doing things, I love that.  So where is -- I guess kind of along those lines, since we're on the heat shield, you're talking about these blocks being designed, where is everything happening?  Where are the blocks being manufactured and tested and all that?    Ronny Baccus: So we have -- so our team is -- we've got facilities at multiple locations kind of across the country.  The primary design center for the -- with our partners, Lockheed Martin, that is developing the design and doing the fabrication for the spacecraft is in their facility in Denver, Colorado.  All the design activity happens there.  The primary structure is all fabricated there.  It's tested there for strength to verify that it's going to perform the way we want.  And then all of that hardware is delivered to the Kennedy Space Center.  The AVCOAT system is manufactured -- now that we've moved to this block architecture, we have the capability down at the NASA Michoud Facility down in New Orleans -- so Lockheed Martin has got a team there as well and they've got production capability.  And we've over the past few years built up the capability to build the heat shield material, thermal protection material, in these AVCOAT blocks at Michoud in New Orleans.   And all those blocks are delivered to Kennedy Space Center for installation onto the structure.  And then of course the tile system that we have on the backshell, you know, we have maintained that production capability.  Those tiles were, during the shuttle era, all fabricated at Kennedy Space Center and we're maintaining that for our uses as well.    Host: There you go.    Ronny Baccus: We've got pieces everywhere and it all comes together at KSC and getting ready for flight.    Host: Awesome!  So this is an interesting question because 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit is -- that's pretty hot -- and even you said, there's temperatures that are even higher than that but they're not on the vehicle itself.  How do you test the material to make sure it's going to withstand those high temperatures?    Ronny Baccus: Right.  So our biggest workhorse test facility for evaluating designs for how are they going to stand up to the reentry thermal environment is at Arc Jet Facility at Ames Research Center in California.  There are -- the Arc Jet Facility, there are several facilities there that can provide, depending on what environment that you're targeting -- you know, what kind of a heating duration and magnitude are you trying to get?  Then that kind of determines, well, which facility will I go into?  Primarily, our testing runs through our team members at Ames who perform those tests for us and we evaluate a lot of different design features.  If we're looking at just the basic performance of the material, is it recessing or ablating away at the rate that we predict?  Are the temperatures following the predictions -- all of those things that are important to validating the design.   We'll take a sample of this AVCOAT material and put it in this chamber and then you've got this superheated plasma essentially, dissociated gas that will simulate the reentry environment.  This arc heater will, basically like a big torch that can get up to very high temperatures.    Host: So cool.    Ronny Baccus: And then you define, well how long do I want to stay at this temperature and you define this profile, and then you can compare the results of the test with your analytical predictions and see how am I doing?  Do I need to change the model and how I'm assuming how thick does it have to be, right?  So we've gone through, you know, hundreds of tests, looking at different things that have gone through the Arc Jet Facility.  We've also looked at -- we've done some tests up at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base at our research lab there.  They have a unique capability to apply a very high-energy thermal environment using lasers.  Now it's a different mode of getting heat in but you can get very hot and also put mechanical load, or you can basically bend the sample at the same time as you're heating it.  So you're getting that sort of combined effect now, right?    Host: Right, there you go.    Ronny Baccus: Because you're coming in.  You're entering the atmosphere, you know, all this heating on.  But at the same time, you've got air pressure building up and so you're flexing the heat shield at the same time as you're heating it up.  So that's a way to kind of check the -- sort of the combined effects of those two things at once.    Host: There you go.    Ronny Baccus: And so we've run quite a few tests through there.  We've got testing capabilities at Johnson Space Center here.  We've got a radiant test facility that we'll put thermal energy in, depending on what we're trying to do.  Those are the main areas that we've done testing for and we're -- you know, in addition to just testing the material system itself, there are things like, well now we've got this block system.  Well, what do you do at the interface from one block to the next, right?  You've got a -- you can't have a crack.  You can't have a groove.  So to fill it in, we have what's called RTV, which stands for room-temperature-vulcanized -- it's a type of rubber, basically.  And we put some special ingredients in the mix to make sure it preforms and stretches the way we want.  But we have to make sure that there's not some unique failure mode hiding in the design, you know, at these features or at these interfaces, right?  So we spend a lot of time testing out the gap filler and how is it performing in these environments as well.   So that's been a key part of our demonstration and getting confidence in this block system before we put it up in the air.    Host: Yeah.  Because when you're talking about testing -- the reason I ask is I find this so fascinating is you talked about, you know, you go through all of these tests and then finally you fly EFT-1 and then find improvements, you know?  You have this big test, the actual flight that reveals something.  You just can't -- no matter how many times you test, once you do it, you still learn so much.    Ronny Baccus: Absolutely.    Host: So that's one of the incredible things about testing, and that's why I'm so looking forward to these upcoming tests, you know, EM-1, EFT-1.  What are you looking forward to with these upcoming things to finding out?    Ronny Baccus: Well, certainly the EM-1 mission is going to be huge for the entire team of course but looking kind of from my knothole, how does the structure perform?  And in particular, how does the thermal protection system perform?  For EFT-1, we had a very high heating environment, you know, by design.  We lofted the orbit up 3,000 miles up in apogee, I think it was, and then came in and really dug into the atmosphere to really try to put a stressing environment on the heat shield and learned a lot of things from how did it perform and how did it compare with our predictions?  Well, for EM-1, that -- we're going out even further, right?  We're going out to the Moon and back.  And by the time you get back, those velocities, you know, you're back up to 25,000 plus miles an hour.  How is the heating environment going to interact with our design, right?  And so we've really done a lot of testing on the ground but it's not a replacement for flying it.   You see it, you know, how is it going to do?  We've made assumptions.  There are certain things that we know you can't test on the ground -- certain corners of the design box, if you will, that we can't duplicate on the ground.  The only way you get it is if you fly.  And so for those areas, you know, we may carry some additional uncertainty in our analysis and how we're sizing the system to handle those loads.  So we're really looking forward to getting some real flight data on this system and we can go and compare.  You know, maybe after I see how it flies a time or two, I can start to reduce those uncertainties in that area and confirm that there's no hidden, you know, failure modes or something that we need to pay attention to, you know?  There's a lot of good things coming out of EM-1 and we're really looking forward to getting that data and getting it in the hands of the engineers.    Host: Yeah, like an altered design, right?  You're testing it a lot, but really -- it'll be exciting to see that thing come through the atmosphere and deploy the parachutes, yay!  You know?  You did it.    Ronny Baccus: Absolutely.    Host: So that's going to be pretty exciting.  You know, this is where we're talking about these test flights but then, beyond that, we're talking about missions to the Moon, missions to Mars.  What needs to change to make those successful, or is this something that we can apply to future deep space missions?    Ronny Baccus: Right.  So we have -- just from the very beginning of the design of the Orion vehicle -- have purposely designed it to be as capable and as robust as we can so that we keep our options open as far as destinations, right?  We want to make sure we're providing ourselves with that latitude so that if, you know, if we're doing lunar missions, right?  So we've got these upcoming missions -- EM-1 and EM-2.  EM-1 will basically be our big shakedown flight, you know, coming back at lunar velocity -- return velocities, obviously.  EM-2, we'll have crew on board, right?  That'll be huge.  And then if you're looking -- and so we've designed the vehicle from the get-go for those environments.  If you're looking at the later missions, you know, we're evolving to this gateway concept of having an outpost out on the other side of the Moon, those return velocities are still very similar, well within the capability of what the Orion heat shield can handle once we get -- and we demonstrate that up front with these test flights.   And then, of course, off in the horizon, we've got our eye on Mars and, you know, there may be -- day-to-day, we're working the immediate problems but that's -- Mars is always there, right, in our minds.  And so looking at the return velocities from Mars, there are a number of different ways you can go to and from Mars.  Some of the return trajectories will be way too fast for really any material to handle, but there are a nice class of trajectories that our guidance and navigation control team can put us in that will be within reach of the current design that we have.  And what's interesting about the way this material works, you know, let's say you're coming back on a Mars mission.  The typical class of trajectories that we would be looking at may be 10 or 15% higher in velocity, roughly.  Okay, so it is faster but it's not inordinately faster.   And so, at those kind of speeds, the surface temperature, just based on the physics of how the oblation works, is still at 5,000 degrees.  It's essentially the same temperature even though you're coming in a little bit faster.  But what's happening is you still have more energy coming into the system.  And so for that case as we evolve towards beyond the Moon and evolve towards Mars capability, we're expecting that the thickness will have to increase a little bit so that we maintain that backside temperature limit is how we'll manage that.  So we do have some knobs we can turn to make sure we, even for Mars missions, that we are able to reenter safely and protect the spacecraft and the crew from a mission like that.    Host: I like that phrase, \"just turning some knobs,\" right?  You're working towards these deep space missions but really just, you know, a few tweaks based on the knowledge we have now and you can -- you're talking about a mission to Mars and even beyond.  That's really exciting.  So Ronny, thank you so much for coming on the show today.    Ronny Baccus: You bet!    Host: And explaining this.  I've never really gotten a chance to sit down and go this deep into just how a spacecraft is not only going to survive in space but then dealing with these insane temperatures.  It's pretty exciting stuff, so I appreciate you coming on.    Ronny Baccus: You bet!    [ Music ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So today we talked with Mr. Ronny Baccus about the Orion and the temperatures that it's going to have to withstand out in missions to the Moon and even beyond but then, more importantly, that 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit temperature screaming back into Earth's atmosphere -- that's going to be wild.  We've talked about Orion before on the podcast on a couple of episodes, so you can go back and listen to some of them.  You don't really have to do it in any particular order.  But we do a nice overview for Episode 17.  We talk about how the crew is going to operate inside on missions that can go up to three weeks for Episode 28.  And then you can actually listen to Episode 35 and take a ride inside the capsule.  We bring audio from EFT-1, the mission that we talked about during today's episode, and bring it inside that episode and just -- you can just sort of sit back and feel what it's like to launch on Orion and reenter Earth's atmosphere and even splashdown.  I've been talking to a lot of Orion folks lately, so you can go to nasa.gov/orion and search for an article called \"The Top Five Technologies Needed for a Spacecraft to Survive Deep Space.\"   This heat shield is one of them and we're going to address a lot of them just kind of scattered on this podcast.  But you can go and read that right now, it's a great article.  You can follow Orion on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.  Use the #AskNASA on your favorite platform to submit an idea for \"Houston We Have a Podcast.\"  Make sure to mention that in the post so we can go look for it and maybe answer it on the show or bring in an expert to answer it for us.  So this episode was recorded on August 28, 2018.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, Bill Stafford, Pat Ryan, Laura Rochon, and Rachel Kraft.  Thanks again to Mr. Ronny Baccus for coming on the show.  We'll be back next week.",

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, We Have A Podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 30, Infamous Meteorites.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  So on this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know the coolest stuff about what's going on right here at NASA.  So today, we're talking about some of the more unique findings that have been discovered in meteorites with David Mittlefehldt, goes by Duck.  He's a planetary scientist here at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and we had a great discussion about curious findings in meteorites, and the adventures that are endured to procure them.  So, with no further delay, let's go lightspeed and jump right ahead to our talk with Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt.  Enjoy!     [ Music & Radio Transmissions ]   Host: Duck, thanks for coming to the podcast today.  I know we've -- we've talked about searching for life and meteorites before, and it's -- it's such a fascinating topic, but I really wanted to dive deeper, just into like the meteorites portion.  We really -- we really actually had a great conversation with Dr. Aaron Burton and -- and Dr. Marc Fries, not too long ago, actually, about life, but really just about the meteorites themselves.  There's a -- there's a big story there, and you're one of the explorers that are going down and actually finding these meteorites, huh?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Yeah, yeah.  I've done that on a number of occasions.    Host: Yeah.  And it's -- is it -- is it mostly in Antarctica, or are you going other places?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Well, okay, so most of the times I've been searching for meteorites has been in Antarctica, so I've been down there five times, meteorite collecting expeditions, but I -- I've [pause] -- I was on vacation in Israel once, and I met up with a couple of geologists at a coffee house, and one of them had just published a paper where they -- he described, you know, old surfaces in the deserts of southern Israel that are, you know, have been stable for about 2 million years.  And I'm thinking, you know, over 2 million years, you can accumulate a lot of meteorites, so, I actually went there the foll -- later that year, and met up with them again, and we searched some of these areas that are -- have very ancient pavements on the desert, and hunting for meteorites.  We didn't find any, unfortunately, and, you know, I'm not quite sure why, there -- there should have been some there, but, you know, it was a small team searching large area over short time, so it may well be that they're there, but we just didn't find any, because the ones that, you know, are there are small.    The other is there were a number of issues with that particular location.  Meteorites, you know, when we find meteorites, they're typically black on the outside, because they've gone through the atmosphere and they're covered with this glassy, fusion crust, which is almost always black.  The area we had searched in southern Israel actually had a number of dark rocks in it, as well.  So, you know, the meteorites, if they were there, would not have stood out as -- like -- like, you know, the beacons that you see when you're in Antarctica, scooting across the bare ice, so.    Host: I guess that -- is that the main reason why Antarctica is such a great place to find meteorites?  Is because it's these black rocks against white snow?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Well, that certainly makes it easy, because [Gary laughing] you -- you can see, you know, a rock, I'm going to use metric units because that's what I'm used to, I'll try and remember to throw in inches and feet as I can, but, so, you know, you can find a -- a black rock, a couple of centimeters across or about an inch across, from a great distance in Antarctica on the ice.  And -- and, as you say, it's because you're looking at either pale blue ice or sometimes white snow, most of the meteorites we find are on the pale blue ice.  But even so, it's very bright in comparison to rock.  So they're easy to find there.  The other thing is in Antarctica, we have a convenient concentration mechanism, which is the actual flow and ablation of the ice across the continent, and where we go to find them the meteorites is -- is actually in locations where the ice movement has been stalled, and ablation by the Antarctic winds and -- and warming by the Antarctic sun, allow a lag deposit to develop on the surface.    So we're actually collecting meteorites that have been, you know, shoved from a great geographic area and then left behind in a smaller geographic area.  So we have, you know, base -- we have both the easy-to-spot and -- and the concentration mechanism working in our favor.    Host: Alright!  Yeah, they're -- they're plentiful down there.  So -- so you made quite a few trips.  How many was it?  You said five?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Yeah, I've been down five times.  The first time was in the '97, '98 field season.  That was my first Antarctic experience, and I loved it so much I kept volunteering to go back again.    Host: You loved Antarctica?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Oh yeah [Gary laughing], I -- I love it, you know, just -- just last week, well, here in Houston, we had temperatures that Houstonians think of, or Texans think of as cold, but, me, I see that as maybe a cold fall day.  Because I -- I was born and raised in western New York.    Host: Alright.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: And at the same time, you know, my hometown was getting temperatures, okay, again, I've got to do some conversion here, about maybe, you know, between 0 and 5 degrees Fahrenheit.  And, you know, that was the weather I grew up in winter, and I loved it.  Winter was always my favorite season when I was a kid.    Alright.  So maybe it's a deep love of winter that really -- because I just came from this -- we're just coming back from the holidays now, and it was -- it was negative 2 in Pittsburgh when I -- when I was flying home, and, I mean, I was -- I was born and raised in Pennsylvania, moved around a lot, but I'm not used to it by any means.  Like, I like the -- I like the, everyone, you know, saying, oh my gosh, 32 is really cold!  And I'm like, [laughing], I'm okay with just that.    Host: For me, I -- I loved the deep winter in western New York.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Alright, a lot of snow there too.    Host: So when was the last time you were down in Antarctica then?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: So I was down last year, 2016, 2017, it was kind of a disappointment for me, personally.    Host: Oh.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: I -- I -- because of my experience, I've been down four times before, I -- I left early and was going to go out on a recon sweep with the -- the mountaineer field safety officer for the ANSMET program.  ANSMET, by the way, stands for Antarctic Search for Meteorites, and that's the program that goes down to collect the rocks and has been doing so every year, but once, since 1976.    Host: Alright!    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: But, anyway, because of my experience, I was going to go down on this recon before the main season.  We were going to go to one area, check it out for potential systematic work in a future season, and then stay for the first half of the main season, going to a location deep along the Antarctic, transAntarctic mountains.  Well, it turns out logistics were badly broken last year.  And partly because of weather, partly because of problems with the aircraft and so on, so I got out into the field for a week, in preseason, I got back to McMurdo Station while we were gearing up for the main season, but the logistics just broke and so they were not going to go out where they originally planned.  The team ended up going to where I had been out on recon, but it was -- they got such a late start that it made more sense to ship me home early rather than, you know, go out for maybe a week and then come back into McMurdo and go home.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: So I -- I just spend one week out in the field last year.    Host: Ahh...    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Much -- much to my chagrin.    Host: [Laughing] So it was just the lack of time that you spent there, that was really the disappointment.    Yeah, yeah, it was [inaudible] time, and, you know, in the brief time that John Scott [phonetic] and I, he's the mountaineer, were out on the ice, you know, we -- we'd spend a week in the field, two and a half days we were tent-bound because the weather was so bad, but even so, we found 46 meteorites in the short time we were there.    Host: That's amazing!    Yeah.    Host: Wow.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: And -- and remind -- and remember, this was an area that had been heavily harvested back in the 80's, 70's and 80's, we were going to back to see whether there was still great potential for harvesting more meteorites there, and, in fact, I think last year they ended up coming -- picking up a total of 200 and some meteorites, even with, you know, going back to an area that had been searched before, and having a shortened season because the logistics.  So, I mean, that -- that kind of shows you the -- the quality of Antarctica as a -- as a site for bringing back space rocks.  It's just awesome!    Host: Incredible!  So is -- is that -- is it because there's just a fresh, I guess you could call it, supply of meteorites that are landing on the surface of Antarctica, or is it things are shifting?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: It's more things are shifting.  In part, you know, deflation of the surface continues, as ablation goes on, and so new meteorites are poking through.  In part, it's shifting winds blowing snow around, so an area that might have been snow covered earlier season, maybe now has been stripped bare and there's bare ice.  And so that allows you to see things.  So for a variety of reasons, you can go back to the same place you've searched once, and -- and still find meteorites out there.    Host: Incredible.  And hundreds of them, a little bit better than Israel, right?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Yeah [laughter].  Might have been better than my experience trying to find meteorites in the Negev Desert.    Host: [Laughing] So -- so you're saying a season.  When you're going down to Antarctica, I'm assuming it's the summer there, right?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Yeah, it's austral summer.    Host: Yeah.  So that means the sun is up 24/7, right?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Right.    Host: So you kind of have to deal with that when you're -- when you're down there, right?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Yeah, you know, I've -- I've become accustomed to that.  The first -- I was kind of -- there was a guy who used to work in our building who had been down I think a year or two before me, so I took advice from him, and he said, you know, one of the things is, you know, with the constant sunlight, sometimes sleep can be a problem.  So I bought a heavy, black knit hat, and, you know, I just put that on as my sleep hat, and then pulled the brim over my eyes, and so everything was black.  So I -- I could sleep fine down there.    Host: Oh, nice!    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: But the, you know, the main advantage is that because the sun's up 24/7, you're not really bound by the 9 to 5 time sequence.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: So, as I said, when we -- when I was out last year in the -- in the recon site, we were there for a week, you know, we -- we landed, got our gear, and then went, spent a half a day out, then the -- the winds blew in, it was too windy and cold to go out, so the winds broke around noon one day, or a little bit after noon.  We decided we would have an early supper and then go out and collect -- harvest meteorites.  So that day, we ended up getting out of the tents maybe 5 o'clock in the evening, and we worked about till 30, 2 in the morning.    Host: Woah!    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: The sun was up, it was perfectly fine, it was just my age and body crapping out at 30 [Gary laughing].  I, you know, I just couldn't pick up another meteorite if -- if they beat me with a stick.  You know, I was just so tired.  But then, you know, that's -- that's something you can do down there that you can't do here.    Host: Yeah, did you know the hours were going by, or did you have no sense of time with the -- with the sun being up?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Well, you know, you can trace the sun, if you pay attention, you can get a sense of the day, because the sun does a lazy loop in the sky, and...    Host: Oh.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt:...and so, you know, once you've located yourself, you know where north, south is, [pause] there is still north and south, even that close to the pole.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: But, you know, you know at midnight, the sun is going to be, you know -- you know, at one -- at the one position, so.    Host: Right.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: And it's kind of at the lowest point far north, and so, you know, you can track it that way, but basically I didn't pay attention.  We were just so busy, you know, driving from place to place harvesting meteorites that, you know, it was just constantly moving, doing the next one, taking the data, collecting it, you know, cleanly and safely and getting it in the bag and moving on to the next location.    Host: Oh, so are you -- are you not -- you're not stationary then when you -- when you kind of set up camp.  Are you -- are you kind of mobile, like with your camp, and you just move it from one meteorite site?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: No, no.    Host: Oh, okay.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: The camp is usually -- there are a couple -- there are a couple of ways that it is done.  When we do systematic searching, the camp is stationary in one spot, perhaps for the whole field season, and you just go out, day-to-day, to different locations.  And that's what we did here.  We were on recon, so we -- we plunked the tent down, then we searched within easy skidoo range of the camp.  Sometimes, and I've done this before, go down on a recon time, where -- where you go and you put camp down, you might prospect an area for two, three weeks, then you move camp to another area and prospect there for two or three weeks.  So, there -- there are -- those -- there are those two types of scenarios, and even in the recon mode, you know, you're -- the tent -- the camp is stationary for two or three weeks, and you're skidooing all around that area to -- to search it, and then you only pick up tents and camp and move to a far distant area to recon that general region.    Host: Alright!  Alright, well I'm guessing, you know, going down there so many times, you're quite an expert in making sure that, you know, you can survive weeks and weeks and weeks in Antarctica.  So, what are the -- some of the stuff that you're taking down there that I guess are unique to the Antarctic environment?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Okay, so, most of the gear you get, you get in Christchurch, so, you know, living in Houston, I don't have a winter coat.    Host: Oh!    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: So, at -- at the clothing distribution center in Christchurch, you'll get outkitted -- outfitted with, you know, heavy -- heavy jackets, all the gloves you can want, thermal pants, fleece liners, boots, hats, everything you need to survive, and then in McMurdo Station, you actually get the camping gear, the tents, the cook stoves, the dishes, the food, sleeping bags, that sort of stuff.  So all -- all the intrepid Antarctic explorer needs to take down with them are personal items, like I mentioned my knit hat, that -- that was mine, and that was because I knew I wanted something to sleep in.  I, you know, I bought extra pairs of thermal underwear, because the first time I went down, you know, they -- they give you two sets, but you're out in the field for six or seven weeks, so you want to change, you know, once in a while.  [Gary laughing] Other than that, you know, my glasses are prescription, and so I buy glasses that transition dark and sunlight, so I can just, you know, wear my normal glasses out on the skidoo, I have actually bought glacier glasses, so I have side shields and whatnot to block the light.   You want to -- one of the things that really is critical down there is to block all light from your eyeballs, you know, other than what gets filtered through a dark lens, because, otherwise, snow blindness is a problem.    Host: Oh, that's right!  It's so bright down there, right?  Yeah.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: So I do that, but, otherwise, you know, most of the gear they give you, they loan it to you for the time that you're out there, and -- and so, you know, you could survive on just what you get from the Antarctic program down in Antarctica.  It wouldn't necessarily be entirely comfortable wearing the same clothes, you know, for seven weeks, but you could do it.    Host: [Laughing] So -- so your -- this Antarctic program, that -- that's ANSMET, right?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Right.    Host: Okay, so what's the -- what's the relationship between ANSMET and NASA, and how that all works together?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Well, originally, ANSMET was set up as a three agency agreement.  So the -- the -- it was funded -- the actual Antarctic search for meteorites was funded through the National Science Foundation, because they have -- they do the scientific research in Antarctica.  NASA funded the curation and allocation of meteorite samples here at NASA Johnson Space Center, and then the Smithsonian Institution did the initial classification and was the long-term repository for the meteorites collected in Antarctica.  That, since -- since then, they've changed it, and now NASA actually funds the Antarctic, the ANSMET research component.  NSF still supplies the logistics, but NASA pays NSF for those, those logistics, because they -- they are the, I mean, they have all the logistics in Antarctica.    And -- and the rocks still go, ultimately, to the Smithsonian, a chip for initial classification, and rocks that are no longer actively being researched by scientists in the world end up being permanently curated at the Smithsonian Institution.  So that is -- that is still the way things are run.    Host: Alright.  So -- so is the ones that people are researching, and actively studying, are all of them housed here at the Johnson Space Center?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Yes.  With some exceptions.  We don't have the necessary facilities to easily deal with metal-rich meteorites.  So iron meteorites, stony iron meteorites, automatically go, ah, nope, I'm going to pull that back.  Iron meteorites automatically go to the Smithsonian Institution.  Because they are equipped for -- to cut metal and -- and make samples available.  We do do the stony meteorites here, I forgot about that, because I've gotten some from here.  So those that have a significant stony component are still worked on here until they become no longer of scientific interest.  But, you know, even though they go to the Smithsonian for permanent curation, they're -- they're not dead to science, so to speak.  So I can request samples that have been housed at Johnson Space Center for years, and now transfer -- transformed permanently to the Smithsonian if -- if I find, you know, an interesting project to do on one of these old samples.    And I actually have gotten, in the past, some samples from the Smithsonian that were originally from the Antarctic collection.    Host: Wow.  So back in Antarctica, when you're looking at these meteorites and you're trying to, you know, figure out what they are, are they, you know, more stony, more metal-rich, what are you using to -- to look at them, to find out more about them and say, yes, that's a meteorite that I want to get my hands on?  How do you know what's the good stuff?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Uh, decades of experience.    Host: There you go [laughing].    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: So, I, you know, I can look at a rock in Antarctica, and I can already make a preliminary classification.  Sometimes I'm wrong, and -- and, you know, the guy who has more experience than anyone is -- is our mountaineer field safety officer, John Scott, and, you know, he -- he can look at a rock, and, in many cases, give a pretty good guess as to what it's going to turn out to be.  And, you know, I can do that with a lot of different types of rocks, especially those that I'm interested in, but all in all, there -- there are always those meteorites that come back that either no one has ever seen before, because it's totally new, or it's enough different from the norm for that class that it just doesn't -- doesn't appear to be what you think it is, in hand sample.  So, and we don't -- and we don't, you know, in Antarctica, we don't do anymore than a very high-level classification.    Yes, this is a stony meteorite, it's probably a chondrite, this is probably a carbonaceous chondrite, this is probably an achondrite, which is a type of meteorite that's been melted.  This is probably a stony iron, an iron, and so forth.  And, to some extent, we need to do that because certain types of meteorites have more scientific value than others.  So -- so, for example, a very primitive carbonaceous chondrite is -- is probably going to get a lot of research attention when it's announced.  And so we collect those in a special way to try and minimize contamination by organic compounds.  And that's why we need to be able to say, oh, yeah, you know, stand back from this guy, we need to treat him differently than -- than this one over here.    Host: Alright.  And then, obviously, you know, knowing where to ship it too, right?  Because some of the metals one have to go the Smithsonian...?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: So that -- no, that's all done here.  Everything is shipped here to Johnson Space Center.    Host: Oh, everything comes here, okay.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: And -- but the difference is when they -- when they open some that are listed in the -- in the notes as probably being iron meteorites, they -- they will warm them up in the dry nitrogen cabinets, look at them, and if they agree, you know, they'll do an external description, you know, this is a brown rock, you know, 10 centimeters in size and weigh so much, and we don't see anything in it, you know, out of the ordinary, from the outside, then the whole thing will -- then that whole rock will get shipped to the Smithsonian at that point, and there, they'll cut it open with a wire saw, if it's, you know, indeed, probably metal, and then make a polished mount and etch it to bring out the texture and so forth.    Host: Alright!  And then that's what you mean by the facilities, right?  They have the -- the proper facilities to do that.  So what about here?  What kinds of equipment and facilities do we have to make sure that we're handling all of this properly?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: So, in the meteorite processing lab, we have [pause] -- we use tools of a very limited set of composition.  So, typically, stainless steel hammers and chisels, and -- and the reason is, you know, no matter what we do with a rock from space, we're going to contaminate with something from earth.  So the object is to, one, minimize that contamination.  So we use materials that we know are not going to, you know, just shed particles everywhere, for example, but also if we -- we use always the tools of the same -- of a given composition so that we know that if we see something like this in the rock, oh yeah, that must have come from the tool.  And, you know, I've seen this, rocks are hard to break, and so, you know, your -- your choices are to saw them open or to use a hammer and chisel, and I have seen on a rock that I've gotten, a flake from the chisel that rubbed off.    Metal, you know, it's soft, even hardened steel will rub off on occasion.  So, you know, I can see this, I can pull that contaminant off or isolate it, in the lab, but, you know, I know then I can do a simple test, yes, that's from the chisel, I don't have to worry about that.  I've taken care of it, the rest of the sample is fine.  So the object is to minimize contamination or to know what the potential contaminants are.  And, you know, there's no way you know of getting -- there's -- with modern technology, we can't, you know, we don't have magnetic levitation devices that we then use a laser to slice them open cleanly.  You know, we -- we do with what we got.  This isn't Star Trek here yet.    Host: [Laughing] We'll just stick with the hammer and chisel for now.  So, I mean, when you're cutting these open, and you open them up, what -- what are you looking at?  Are you looking at just the rock or are you taking even smaller chunks of that?  How is that working?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Well, that all depends on the question that you're trying to answer, and I've done both where I've asked for samples of a, what's called a bulk sample of the rock, so something as representative of the entire rock as possible, and I've looked for individual class in the rock, little fragments that are of a specific type within the rock.  All of this is basic 19th century geology, in many respects.  You know, in the 19th century, geologists would go out in the field with their hammers, they'd -- they'd beat on a rock and use a hands lens to look at the microscopic, yeah, microscopic texture, mineralogy in it, and, you know, a trained geologist can do the same with a meteorite, and say, yeah, okay, I can see -- I can see what this is, it's a certain type of rock type in there, and that's what I want, I don't want this part over here.  So, you know, the traditional geologic methods,but with modern equipment, can be used, and -- and, you know, there's -- there's nothing like the human eye in the brain for sorting out who's who in the zoo.    Host: [Laughing] So then how can you -- what -- what are some of the key differences for the -- for the non-geologically-trained eye for whenever you're looking at a rock and you can, you know, you cut it open and you look and you say, that's a meteorite, that's not from earth?  Or, this is definitely from earth?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Okay, the -- the first key is -- - is fusion crust.  I mentioned this earlier.    Host: Oh yeah.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: And that -- that's where, going through the atmosphere, friction with the air causes the outer surface to melt, and actually, you know, little bits are flying off all the time, the meteorite we get on the surface is just a small piece of what entered the atmosphere.  Most -- sometimes the vast majority of it just ablated away in the atmosphere into little droplets or dust.    Host: Wow.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: So, you know, if you see a fusion crust on the rock, right away, you know it's -- it's a meteorite, you don't have to go any farther than that.  In terms of determining what type it is, more primitive meteorites, these are a type that still have textures and mineralogy that were inherited from condensation and accretion in the solar nebula, that's where individual mineral grains formed out of a gas that -- that was the nebula before the planets were around.  And -- and then they glomerate together, these mineral grains, and in the -- in the solar nebula, the dust grains banged, you know, got melted into little, tiny objects which we call chondrules.  So, these typical textures are plainly evident to the human eye, even without a microscope.  But, you know, with a very low-power microscope you can see them quite easily.    Most meteorites, especially primitive ones, contain iron metal, it's actually iron nickel metal.  You know, you don't find that on earth except when humans have been involved in -- in smelting iron ore.  But so iron metal in a -- in a rock is kind of an indicator that it's quite likely from outer space.  Very few occurrences on earth of native metal in a rock.  And then, as I said, in the dust in the solar nebula, went through periods of melting and formation of these little, round globules of basically melt globules, which we call chondrules, and -- and from that, we get the name chondrite for these primitive rocks.  Well, those stand out in, you know, if you break open a rock, depending on -- on the type, you know, you can see those quite easily, and -- and that's a key.    Host: And these have never -- they've been in space for all of time, right?  They were formed in space and traveling through space, they've never -- they're not like from another planet or another, like, chipped off another...?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Well, most...no, actually, all meteorites, the only way we get meteorites is for bad things to happen in the asteroid belt.  Most meteorites are from asteroids, and when they collide, little fragments get knocked off, and it's -- it's from these fragments that we get meteorites.  So they were originally on much larger bodies, I mean, much larger meaning asteroid size, not planet size.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: And they were broken up and then distributed to the earth.  You know, one of the, sorry, I'm going to -- I'm going to sort of go back into -- and get into my way back machine and go back to when I was a grad student.    Host: Please do!    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: When I -- you know, when I first started learning about meteorites, one of the mysteries at the time was there was a group of chondrite meteorites called the L chondrites, L was just the name, you know, the -- the name applied to them.  That had ages on the order of 500 million years, and this was really odd, because all meteorites are about four and a half billion years old.  Well these, they -- they -- these meteorites were originally about four and a half million -- billion years old, but were somehow affected by an event that reset the ages about 500 million years ago.    Host: Woah.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: And so, you know, this was, you know, just kind of an anomaly.  We knew something bad had happened to an asteroid then, about that time, well, fast forward to, I think the 90's, a Swedish geologist started finding in terrestrial sediments fossil meteorites.  And, you know, all that's left is a few mineral grains.  You -- you can tell, they were found in fine grain limestone, you know, formed on an ocean floor, and all that you could see was this halo of odd stuff, please a few mineral grains that remained from the original meteorite.  Well, you know, this guy, and his compadres, studied these mineral grains and they -- they found out they were from the same type of meteorite as these chondrites that were about 500 million years old, and they were in layers in the rock of the earth that were about that age.  So, sometime, 500 million years ago, you know, a couple of asteroids collided, and a whole rain of meteorites of this type hit the earth at about, you know, within a few million years when that occurred, and we can find them now.    This layer in Sweden that's just chock full of these fossil meteorites.  And, you know, to me, that's one of these really neat kind of science stories.  Where everything starts tying together.  And then to get even further, astronomers looking at what they call asteroid families, so they -- they find an asteroid, they find a whole bunch in orbits similar to it, spectroscopically, they all look to be about the same, and so they -- they figure out, well, these are all, you know, fragments of something that broke apart.  Well, they found an asteroid that they figure, you know, based on the spectroscopy, it could be this type of, you know, that formed these L chondrites, and the -- they calculate the age of the family based on dispersion of the fragments, and it's about 500 million years.  So, you know, between, you know, meteorite scientists, terrestrial geologists, and astronomers, we -- we've kind of got a neat picture of somehow, you know, about the time of dawn of -- of multicellular life on earth, two asteroids smashed together, and rained down on the earth, and we're still finding fragments coming down to earth now that we can confidently date when this happened in terrestrial laboratories.    It's just kind of one of these things that, you know, I find fascinating!    Host: [Laughing] I find it -- I mean, a lot of this is over my head, because I don't have the same background as you, but I just find it fascinating that you can look at these rocks and -- and get a story, get a story out of it, you know?  Like the story of two asteroids around the time that cellular life was developing coming down to earth and raining down in these locations and telling their story, that's fantastic!    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Yeah, and multicellular.  So this is when...    Host: Multicellular.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: This is when, you know, fossils, shortly after the time when fossils started becoming really abundant in the terrestrial record.    Host: Wow.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: So, yeah, it's just a neat story, and, you know, basically I think that's what got me into geology, originally, was, you know, all you've got is -- is a rock on the surface and somehow you can, you know, if you're smart enough and -- and do the right work, you can start to piece together an entire story of what the earth was like at that time, and so, you know, that's kind of what drew me into geology.    Host: That's fantastic.  I love it!  Especially from -- from my background, marketing and journalistic sort of background, the story telling aspect is just fascinating to me.  And that's kind of like, that, you know, the title of this episode is going to be, Infamous Meteorites, and that's kind of like what I really wanted to dive into is, you know, we've talked about where you're finding these meteorites, and then what you're doing with then, you're actually cracking them open and studying them, but then what are you finding?  What are you finding inside of these meteorites?  What stories?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Yeah.  Well, exactly!    Host: Yeah, so, you know, one of the ones that I know that was brought to my attention was one of them called Allan Hills, and -- I'm going to -- is it 84001, or do you call it by something else?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: No, I call it that.    Host: 84001?  Okay.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Sometimes it's simply referred to as that rock.    Host: [Laughing] Because it's that infamous, huh?  Wow!  Alright, so what's the story behind -- behind this rock?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Okay, so, this came -- this was found in Antarctica in 1984.  And it -- it's [pause] -- it was originally classified as a -- as a type of asteroidal igneous rock that I, at the time, I was studying those -- those types of rocks.  You know, my -- my background is heavily-weighted towards an interest in magnetic processes on the earth, the moon, Mars, and asteroids, and -- and so that's why this one was particularly of interest to me.  So, I was studying that, along with a bunch of others, that were thought to be basically the same classification of rock, and, unfortunately, Allan Hill's had some puzzling features in it that were -- were a little bit off normal for -- for that rock type.  But not so much so that I -- I really stayed up at night worrying about it.    Host:  [Gary laughing]  Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: And so I wrote a paper on -- on this group of rocks, finally, and sent it in, and one of the reviewers said, well, you know, you point out that there's this anomaly in this rock, and you really ought to try and chase down why it's -- what's going on there, why it's different.  And, you know, being a -- a moderately good scientist, I said, okay.  I, you know, he has pointed out, it's a problem, I knew it was a problem, but now I've really got to do something about it.  So I started working at it, and, honestly, I -- I could not find out what was wrong with this particular rock.  It -- it -- there was one mineral phase in it just did not match what anyone would expect for the class.  Quite by chance, I got another sample of that rock for another reason.    And but it really wasn't the sample I had asked for.  So there was as mixup in the thin section.  So a thin section is a very thin slice of a rock, it's about 30 microns thick, doubly polished on both sides, and it's used by people who look through microscopes to look at the minerals and textures in a rock, and then you can put that section into an electron microprobe and actually do analyses of the mineral phases in it.    Host: Wow.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: And so I was -- that's what I was interested in.  And this particular rock, which I thought I had, I was interested in the composition of sulfide phases in the rock.  So I put the sample in the electron microprobe without actually looking at it in the microscope first, because I had seen this rock before, I knew what it was like, I knew what to expect, I just went straight to the electron microprobe, which actually probably was good because I may have turned the rock in and asked for a different one otherwise.  But I'm getting -- I'm looking at it in the microprobe, looking for the mineral phases I'm looking for, and they just really aren't there in the abundance that I expected.  Finally I found a grain and I'm -- I'm banging at it with the electron beam, collecting compositions, and the compositions weren't making sense.  I was expecting it to be, so I was looking for sulfide phases, so I was expecting to have iron monosulfide, so one iron, one sulfur atom, and the composition that was coming out just was not right.    And I checked the calibration, the calibration was perfect, so what's going on?  I was looking at the data, not in atoms, but in mass, so weight percent.  So when I converted it to atoms, I realized I had two sulfur atoms for every iron atom instead of one, and that's when it hit me what was wrong with this rock.  I then backed off, looked at the -- looked at the texture in more detail in the electron microprobe, and realized I had a sample of Allan Hill's, not the meteorite that I thought I had, and I knew which type of rocks had pyrate, the iron disulfide, instead of the iron monosulfide, and I knew those were martian rocks.  And so, you know, it was -- it was probably the most satisfying moment I've ever had in my life, excluding when my children were born, and -- and when I got married [Gary laughing], and if my wife listens to this, I hope she hears that, was, you know, suddenly it dawned on me that this was a martian rock that was totally unlike any other martian rock, except the key minerals were in it, and so, you know, it was just one of these aha moments that -- that you live for.   And, you know, it was just so much fun.    Host: Amazing.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: I tell you.    Host: So what were those -- the key minerals?  What -- what story did they tell?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: So the key was because it had the iron disulfide pyrate instead of the iron monosulfide troite, I knew it was martian, and it was a rock type not known amongst the martian meteorites.  So what it meant was we had a new type of martian rock that was going to tell us even more about the geologic evolution of Mars then we already knew.  And, you know, all of this hit me within like a fraction of a second when I realized what it was.    Host: Wow!    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: So, I mean, I immediately recognized it, it was an, you know, important meteorite.  And that it would tell us big things, and, in fact, you know, it has opened up a whole host of, you know, basically this rock ultimately became a founding member of what you might consider astrobiology, and that came when my colleagues here at Johnson Space Center, Dave McKay, Edward Gibson, and Kathie Thomas and now Simon Clemett is at it, and then there were Simon's dissertation advisors, Stanford was on the paper and several other people, you know, they -- they proposed that a certain both mineralogical and compositional and textural objects in this rock were possibly signs of microscopic life that existed on Mars at one point.    Host: Wow.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: And, you know, to some extent, then this really allowed the whole discipline of astrobiology to blossom because suddenly we had to figure out, you know, what -- how do we understand, how can we possibly search for life and other objects, other planets, you know, what do we need to look for?  Because we're used to looking for life on earth, you know, it's -- it's simple.  Just walking over here, I, you know, I had to wait while an opossum walked past me in front of, on the walkway.  You know, life is everywhere on earth, whereas on Mars, you know, maybe it's not everywhere, and if it was there, how are we going to tell that it was there?  What -- what do we need to do?  So I would say the import of Allan Hill's not so much that it was hypothesized that life -- fossils of life are in that rock, but that it caused scientists to really take a much more rigorous look at how they will search for life other places of the universe.    Host: Wow.  And that's -- that's kind of, you know, like you said, the birth, maybe not the birth, but really the blossoming, and that was the word you used of, of astrobiology, life forming outside of earth.  That's just a wild concept.  How is that even possible?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Yeah, and, you know, the other thing is it did, it was a strong impetus to driving NASA's Mars exploration program, you know, it is -- - a lot of it is geared towards finding evidence for habitability locations on Mars, and, ultimately, you know, from locations where we think there may have been a chance for life, you know, bringing back or -- or studying in situ samples for possible evidence of microbial or -- or larger life on Mars.    Host: Yeah, and you said you were, before we started recording, you said you actually were working with Opportunity too, one of the rovers on Mars.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Yeah.  I, in 2005, I got attached to the Mars Exploration Rover mission.  At the time, we had two rovers going, one Spirit in Gusev Crater, and the other, Opportunity, in Meridiani Planum.  Subsequently, Spirit froze to death one winter.  Basically, so Spirit lost mobility of one of its wheels, so we were driving backwards, dragging one of the front wheels like a boat anchor through the soil...    Host: Oh, man.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: And we, you know, the Rover drivers and scientists are very careful.  We drove over an area that looked like it was going to be solid, trafficable ground, but it turned out there was a basically a hardpan; layer on top of soil hardpan is kind of an indurated layer that's a little bit stiffer, so it didn't look like it was, you know, loose sand, but it turns out we broke through and got mired in a deep sandpit, basically, and we were unable to extract the rover from the sand, in spite of heroic efforts by the engineers, the Rover drivers at JPL, and the solar panel was tilted at a bad angle for, you know, the oncoming winter sun.  So when the sun started getting lower and lower, relative to the tile of the -- of the solar panel, we -- we simply were not getting enough power to keep the rover going and although we tried to contact it again after that winter, we never heard from it again, so it basically just froze to death on Mars.    Host: Oh, man, but is Opportunity its twin?  Is it the...    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Yep, Opportunity is it's twin.    Host: And that one's still going, right?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: And that one's still going.  We're now so -- we're not -- what day is today?    Host: The 8th.    Yeah, we're now about two weeks away from the anniversary, the 16the anniversary of landing on Mars for Opportunity.    Host: 14 years?  Wow!    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: It's still going strong, and we are still actively exploring the geology of Meridiani Planum.  We don't have all the instruments we had when we landed, but we're still making great scientific discoveries, even with the limited rover ability.    Host: How about that?  So how is -- how was, you know, working with a rover on Mars different from looking at meteorites?  Maybe even martian meteorites, like the Allan Hills, here on earth?  How is that different?    Well, so, you know, here on earth, I have the luxury of taking a sample into the lab and -- and using state-of-the-art scientific equipment to -- to tease out, tease out its story.  On Mars, we have cameras that we can use to image the terrain.  So right away, textures, and we have a microscopic camera, so textures allow us to, you know, make inferences about what the rock -- how the rock might have been formed.  We have a camera with 13 color filters on it, so we can do some limited spectroscopy of the rock that helps us compare a limited set of mineralogical variations in the rocks, and then we have the alpha particle x-ray spectrometer, which allows us to do bulk compositions of surfaces.  So, between them, we -- we can -- we can get a fairly good handle of the mineral -- well, mostly the textures and bulk composition, and, to some extent, neurology of a rock, and that helps us understand what processes might have formed the rock altogether.    And, you know, to some extent, where Opportunity is a high-tech version of a 19th century terrestrial geologist.  [Gary laughing] But, you know, the, obviously the spectrometer is better than what they had in the 19th century, and the chemical composition is as -- as good as we could do then and actually better for many elements, but we're still not at the cutting edge, as you -- as you could do if you had a, you know, a mobile laboratory up on Mars.    Host: Yeah, definitely.  And that's kind of your -- your trade-off, right?  Is like, here, you know, you can bring into a lab with all the latest equipment and -- and study these meteorites, but, like you said before, like there's a certain amount of contamination that's going on with just the fact that a meteorite has come through the atmosphere and hit the -- hit the -- surface of the earth, you know, you have to deal with that, but then you have limited instruments right there on -- on Mars.  So, I guess you just kind of have these tradeoffs [laughing].    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Yep.    Host: So another one that you mentioned, another infamous meteorite, was one called Orgueil, and that's one -- that one's much earlier than the Allan Hills one, right?    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: So Orgueil fell in France in 1864, if I -- if I remember right, and what's key here is it's a -- it's a very primitive type of meteorite.  It's a carbonaceous chondrite.  The -- the two letter name for it is a CI carbonate -- chondrite.  These are amongst the most primitive materials, primitive meteorites that we have for study.  They're bulk compositions, basically are identical to what we see for the photosphere of the sun, excluding the most volatile elements like -- like helium, hydrogen, and oxygen and so forth, but if you could take the sun, you know, a cubic kilometer of the sun and condense out all the condensable matter, it would -- the composition would be very much like a carbonaceous, CI carbonaceous chondrite.  So, these have always been the touchstone for understanding the chemical evolution of the solar system.  They are our -- our basis for seeing who has varied from the original composition.    But they're highly-altered, so they are almost completely made up of clays and other low-temperature alteration phases.  So the original high-temperature phases have been replaced.  So, at some point, these things were altered by water in their parent asteroid to the point where all that's left is -- is basically clay.  This makes them [sigh] -- this made Orgueil susceptible to nefarious individual, tempting to prove something, what don't know, because we don't know who that individual was, but, you know, I would call Orgueil the Piltdown Man of meteorites.  So Piltdown Man was -- was this fake fossil made in about 1912 I think to look like it had some of the attributes of an ape, but some of the attributes of a modern human, because someone that that's the way human evolution went, and they wanted to show that we had fossils that fit in within that theory.    Well, Orgueil, at some point, was broken open, and it turns out, because this is clay, you can -- if you get it good and wet, you can kind of break it open like clay, and then they had stuffed in terrestrial seeds and plant fragments and coal, and then put it back together, and coated the outside with glue to make it look like it still had the fusion crust on it.    Host: Oh my gosh!    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: And then this sample was sealed in a bell jar in a museum from 1864, so apparently it happened very early, we don't know who did it, or why, you know, what were they trying to accomplish by this?  Because it was going to be sealed in a bell jar, you know, did they think someone was going to then take it out and look at it, I don't know, but this -- this came to light in 1960's then.    Host: Oh!    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: And so, a well-known meteoriticist, by the name of Ed Anders, very famous, very smart man, he led a study that was published 100 years later, in 1964 in science, where he uncovered, you know, all of this forensic meteoritic work where he showed that, you know, the seeds were, you know, terrestrial seeds, the coal fragments were in there, that glue had been used to put it back together and make it look like it was whole, and -- and all of this, and -- and so that's why, you know, this is an infamous -- infamous meteorite for those who are in the know.  Most people won't have heard of it, but, you know, like I said, it's kind of the Piltdown Man of meteoritics.    Host: Wow!    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: So someone had an agenda, they wanted -- they, for some reason, they wanted to show that life could form on an asteroid or -- or in space, or something, I don't know, but, obviously, they had -- they had some agenda when they did this.    Host: Yeah, I know, but seeds and glue are not really a good way to convince people [laughter].   Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: No.  You know, back in the, you know, mid-19th century, you know, had it been opened up and studied then, maybe it would have caused quite a furor, but, as far as I know, this was only discovered in, you know, a century later.    Host: Wow!  A hundred years of people thinking this is some kind of like capsule of extraterrestrial life, how about that?  So, you know, all of these kind of tell a story and, unfortunately, some of them, this [laughing] -- this particular one is a little bit of a lie, but, you know, we are cracking these open to search for evidence of -- of whatever we can find, right?  Maybe -- maybe the formation of a planet, maybe the formation of solar system, maybe the formation of life.  So, you know, what, in a perfect world, I guess, what would you like to do -- what would you like to study?  What would you like to see and do to really maximize what you can find about learning more about our solar system and about life in the universe    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Well, I mean, that -- that's kind of a difficult question for a scientist to answer, because, you know, truth be told, we're all paid to pursue our hobbies, and so we all have our own hobby horses.  So, as I -- as I mentioned, you know, my particular interests are in igneous processes, I, you know, on the earth, moon, Mars, asteroids, I -- I like magmatic rocks, and, you know, I couldn't tell you why, it's just the way I am [Gary laughing].  So, one of the things -- one of the things that's very curious about asteroidal igneous rocks is that asteroids were melted very early in the solar system, probably within a couple million years of the formation of the earliest-known solids in the solar system.  So something had to heat up relatively small objects, maybe a few hundred kilometers, you know, 200 miles in -- or in radius, something like that, to the point where they were melted and then cooled down and then they completely shut off after that.    So, it was a very, very intense heat source that acted early, died out, and then never came back.  You know, we think we know what -- what caused this, but there, you know, and so the -- the leading contender is radioactive heating by a very short-lived isotope of aluminum.  It has a half-life of about 730 million years, and so, and aluminum is a -- is a major element in rocks, so, if you -- if you accumulate an asteroid early enough, when there's this aluminum-27 still alive, you've, you know, -- you've then encapsulated a very potent heat source inside that rock.  And so that's what we think happened, but, still, you know, we can admit, as scientists, we can imagine this process going on, but geology is always much more complicated than our imaginations.  So there are things that I don't understand, things that, as far as I know, no one really understands about how asteroids went from being primitive objects that accumulated from minerals formed in the solar nebula to basically a molten ball that then crystallized out igneous magmatic rocks, similar to what we see on earth.    I would desperately like to get, you know, be able to find out more about how -- what was going on, you know, what have we missed, because we, you know, we tend to think of things in -- in the simplest terms, you know, it was heated up, melted, crystallized, that's it, well, we know that -- that's not all the story.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: And I think all meteoriticists have, in the back of their minds, for their particular hobby horses, just things they don't quite understand.  They know the -- the broader picture, but what are the finer details that went into -- to this.  We -- we know we've got the basic story, but what are, you know, all the chapter and verse that go into this basic story?    Host: Wow.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: So, you know, that's what drives me, and it's all -- it's all a matter of, you know, learning something new that -- that, you know, pushes forth human knowledge.  You know, what I do is -- is nowhere near applied science.  It's pure basic science.  So I can't -- I can't talk to someone and say, you know, tomorrow, you're going to be able to have a better life because of what I do, only if, you know, unless you think a better life means knowing more [Gary laughing].  But you never know, because, in -- in general, a large fraction of basic research ultimately does find an application.  Right now, I don't know what that application might be, but I won't say there's never going to be some application for what I do, but, for me, it's -- it's this sense of learning something that -- that drives me.    Host: Yeah.  Why learn if you don't think it's going to end up, you know, giving you a better life.  I mean, honestly, like, you know, learning things kind of helps you understand things, helps things come together, to me, that makes me pretty happy.  So I could see that, you know, better understanding, giving me a better life.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Yeah, well, I mean, you know, humans have always been curious, and, you know, I suspect the reason we're curious is because it's beneficial for survival, because, you know, when -- when you're out on the savannah hunting lions, or hunting gazelles, if you see something moving the weeds over there, you know, okay, is that a gazelle or is that a lion about to eat me instead?  So, you know, humans are geared to being curious about their environment, because it's a survival mechanism.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: And, for scientists, we have now transposed that, you know, away from worrying about whether we're going to be eaten to just, you know, a broad knowledge in general.    Host: [Laughing] Well, I think last time we sat down with Dr. Burton, he said, he kept talking about this time machine, how easy it would be -- how nice it would be to just kind of hop in a time machine, watch these processes take place, and be like, ah [snapping fingers], that's how -- that's how it takes place.  I mean, and then there's whole philosophical idea of, well, is that going to alter the universe if you go back in time and watch these things?  So, you know, that was another tangient we could have gone on and we didn't, but [laughter], but it would be nice to, you know, for the, you know, to improve our knowledge a little bit of how all this stuff works and comes together.  Alright, so, Duck, I think -- I think that about wraps it up for today.  So, thank you so much for coming on the podcast and kind of...    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: It's been a pleasure.  I hope I've imparted something that makes sense to the listeners and -- and that they will find interesting.    Host: It's actually you know, you know, we're talking about rocks, if you think about it, but it's absolutely fascinating, what you can found and the stories behind these rocks and what they tell you about the universe, and even just your trips to Antarctica are pretty fascinating as well, so, again, thanks so much for coming on and telling the stories of these beautiful rocks and your trips to Antarctica, and, yeah, hopefully we'll -- we'll find some cool evidence of life or, you know, you'll find that key ingredient as to why, you know, the asteroids did what they did.    Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt: Yeah, well, I hope so, and thank you very much for the invite!    Host: Absolutely.    [ Music & Radio Transmissions ]  Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So, today, we talked with Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt about some of the cooler, infamous meteorites that have been discovered throughout the years, and then some interesting stories about Antarctica and how he's finding them, it's really a cool process, and he works with the ANSMET, it's the Antarctic Search for Meteorites.  So if you want to learn more about ANSMET and some of the adventures that are going on in Antarctica, and some of the curious findings in these meteorites, especially some that may or may not be life, it turns out there was some, you know, fake meteorites at the end of there, which is kind of disappointing, but that's okay.    You can go to ares.jsc.nasa.gov to get the full scoop on all of these cool meteorites, and -- and you can learn how to get your hands on one of these meteorite samples to study them.  If you go to social media on the NASA Johnson Space Center accounts, or if you go to ARES, or astromaterials, NASA astromaterials, we got pages on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram where we like to share these stories, just use the hashtag, ask NASA, on -- on your favorite platform to submit an idea, or if you have a question about meteorites, or if you want to submit a new topic for the show, to make sure to mention it's for, Houston, We Have A Podcast.  So this podcast was recorded on January 8th, 2018.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, Greg Wiseman, Tracy Calhoun, and Jenny Knots, and thanks again to Dr. Duck Mittlefehldt for coming on the show!  We'll be back next week!",

        description: "Production Transcript for Ep31_The James Webb Space Telescope.mp3     [00:00:00] >> Houston!  We have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 31, the James Webb Space Telescope.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  So on this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, bring them right here on the show to tell you everything about NASA.  So today we are talking about the James Webb Space Telescope with Jonathan Homan.  He's the Johnson Space Center Project Manager for Webb's Chamber A testing.  Chamber A is the giant vacuum chamber that we have here in Texas.  So Jonathan and I had a great discussion about what the James Webb Space Telescope is.  Some of the testing that was actually done actually wrapped up two weeks ago here in Houston, but also some of the testing in other centers, as well as what the telescope is destined to find.  So with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with Mr. Jonathan Homan.  Enjoy.    [00:00:53] [ Music ]    [00:01:01] >> T minus five seconds and counting...  [inaudible].    [00:01:08] >> Houston!  We have a podcast.    [00:01:12] [ Music ]    [00:01:17] >> Jonathan, thanks so much for coming today on the podcast.  I know you are a very busy man right now, especially because the James Webb is kind of wrapping up its testing operations here at Johnson, is that right?    [00:01:29] >> That is correct.  No, I'm glad to be here, and yeah, we wrapped up the testing probably right before Thanksgiving.    [00:01:38] >> All right.    [00:01:38] >> And now we're in kind of what we're calling like the de-integration phase from how we had to test it to packaging it up so it can get ready for its next step of its project, getting ready for launch.    [00:01:50] >> And that's happening soon, right?    [00:01:51] >> Oh yeah.  No, it's-- we're actually putting it in its shipping container tomorrow and--    [00:01:56] >> Yeah!    [00:01:57] >> It will be leaving the Johnson Space Center late Monday night, probably Tuesday morning.    [00:02:05] >> Okay.    [00:02:05] >> And leaving Ellington on Thursday.    [00:02:07] >> Sweet!  All right!  So that's it!    [00:02:09] >> That's it!    [00:02:10] >> Go out for a drink after that, celebrate, I am done!    [00:02:13] >> Correct [laughs].    [00:02:13] >> And then head off to the next guy.  Where's it going next actually?    [00:02:17] >> So it's flying to Los Angeles, and will be at the Northup Bremen facility in Redondo Beach, south of LAX, where it gets integrated with the sun shield and the spacecraft bus, so the, you know, the sun shield has been, you know, one of the huge parts of the telescope and one of the most important parts, so it has a series of testing once its fully integrated, mostly deployments and some acoustic testing.    [00:02:46] >> All right, well fantastic.  That's why I think you're the perfect person to have here, since you've been here working with the James Webb Space Telescope for quite some time now, so you kind of have a good sense of not only the testing, but a little bit more about just what is this telescope and what is it going to do?  So I kind of want to just kind of dive into that, just the whole overview of what is the James Webb space telescope?  So let's start with that.  What is it?    [00:03:12] >> Okay so you know James Webb is kind of a general purpose science tool.  It is part of the next generation of great observatories NASA is working on, so if you think of like the Hubble, Hubble was probably the biggest known great observatory of its generation, so you think like, you know, you had Chandah, Hubble, Spitzer, and I think a few other ones that were, you know, smaller, but Hubble was the big one.    [00:03:38] >> Yeah.    [00:03:39] >> And that's kind of NASA's plan for, you know, the science mission and some of their observations and James Webb is that big, big observatory, so it is not a replacement for Hubble, but a successor.    [00:03:56] >> Okay.  So from what I know about the telescopes, and I'm definitely not a scientist or physicist or anything, so this is kind of, like Hubble can read things in the visual spectrum, and then Chandra is more kind of x-ray, and Spitzer is more infrared.    [00:04:12] >> Correct.    [00:04:12] >> Or did I mix those up?    [00:04:13] >> No, you're absolutely correct, very good yeah.    [00:04:15] >> So then Webb would be the visual spectrum then?    [00:04:18] >> No, no, Webb is infrared.    [00:04:20] >> I see, okay, infrared.    [00:04:22] >> So Hubble is known for being a little bit of ultraviolet, visible was kind of its main spectrum, but it also has a deep field, so it did some infrared type imaging, so if you think of the deep field image it took, where you look at a black spot, and all of a sudden, all these galaxies showed up over time--    [00:04:39] >> Yes, it was like if this really small spot in the sky zoomed in super far, and got--    [00:04:44] >> Yes, that's kind of where James Webb is picking up.    [00:04:46] >> Okay, I see.    [00:04:47] >> So it is definitely looking at the deeper, further, older light of the universe, so...    [00:04:53] >> Fantastic.  So what is the benefit of infrared over visual light?    [00:04:57] >> Well your infrared, because of its mission objectives, you know, it really needs to be in the infrared spectrum.  You know, those objectives are the first light of the universe, when, you know--    [00:05:08] >> Okay, pretty good objective [laughter].    [00:05:10] >> Yeah, yeah, where you have stars and galaxies first pulling things together, lighting up, you know, looking for the-- how the evolution of galaxies and star systems, the birth of stars, you think of things like the Eagle Nebula, that you know, Hubble has given us these great images of, but when you see the infrared, you can start seeing through it, and you see stars actually forming, stabilizing, or possibly even lighting up sometimes in there.  And James Webb can look right through those types of dust clouds and see, you know, what's going on with young stars, because they haven't cleared their space around them, like our star of course has.  Or you've got a clear kind of open area, and it's a little bit older system than a younger area where there's still lots of mass and gravity or mass and elements that can pull stars together that are available.    [00:06:04] >> There you go.  So it's kind of more like pulling back the curtains and saying okay what is going on, what can't we see with the visual spectrum?    [00:06:11] >> That, and also, yeah, as we note, with the universe expanding, you get the red shift, and because infrared is the red shift.  That's why it's so cold, that's why we tested it here at Johnson, at these really cold temperatures, because you need the observatory to be as cold or colder than the light you're trying to look at.  Because everything, you know, our bodies give off an infrared spectrum, so if you're trying to detect something else, you don't want the observatory itself to be warmer, and that's why it's designed the say it is, why we tested it the way it is, and of course, you know, like I said, you're looking at really old, light, old, old galaxies and stars.    [00:06:50] >> Yeah, you're looking at the history of the universe just by going farther and farther out.    [00:06:54] >> Yes.    [00:06:54] >> Fantastic.  So, kind of, I mean, I really want to get into the testing too because that's like, just the kind of testing that we're doing here is phenomenal, and you're the project manager for it, so perfect person to have here, but kind of-- I wanted to, before that, go into a little bit of the history, just, you know, where this all came up, because apparently, like you said, you have Hubble, you have Spitzer, you have Chandra, you have all these great telescopes that are looking out, but this was the next step.  So when did this start coming together, the James Webb?    [00:07:23] >> So it used to be called the Next Generation Space Telescope.    [00:07:26] >> Okay.    [00:07:27] >> And it probably started like pulling together ideas, what we could do, how, what kind of requirements we needed, probably in the 90s.    [00:07:39] >> Oh right!    [00:07:40] >> Yeah, I would say soon after possibly the first Hubble repair mission, I want to say 95, 96 was kind of the first really pulling together of here's an architecture that we think would work for the next great observatory and then I think in 2002, they actually awarded the first big contract, north of Bremen, to be the prime contractor for delivering this telescope to NASA.    [00:08:06] >> There you go, to build it.  Sweet!    [00:08:07] >> Yeah, to build it and of course, you know the telescope portion of it was actually managed a lot through-- by Goddard and NASA, and is being delivered to them.  So I mean kind of the high risk instruments and all that was kind of a collaboration of the different contractors, but also really managed tightly by NASA and with a partnership of both ESA and Canada.    [00:08:31] >> So I mean, like you said, it came shortly after Hubble, was it kind of the excitement of Hubble?  And just like, whoa, these are the images we're seeing?  We want more, right now, and that's what kind of sped up the process maybe?    [00:08:44] >> I wish I knew the actual answer [laughter], I don't know the actual answer, but I could definitely see that that is probably, you know, a good logical reasoning, and yeah, and definitely Hubble just-- I think people were blown away even when it wasn't totally in focus, with the lens that had the astigmatism that it had.    [00:09:01] >> Right.    [00:09:01] >> You know, we're-- so just started looking and going hey, you know, we could spread the light out and get some great science off things we didn't know about, and then once you had the repair mission, what a, you know, huge testimony it was to the Johnson Space Center, working with other centers to, you know, go up there and repair, and now we've got a-- probably at the time, and you know, the best telescope there is, because of its location being outside of the atmosphere, and the size that it was at the time so--    [00:09:27] >> Yes!  And the James Webb is going to kind of take that a step further, and we can kind of go into like, how this thing looks, because when you think about Hubble, it's like this school bus sized tube, right?  That is kind of orbiting outside a little bit higher than the international space station is right now, in terms of an orbit, but James Webb is going to go further out, and it looks very different.  So what's like, the make up of how James Webb looks?  This is an audio podcast, so kind of describe it?  I guess one of the first features that would be prominent are these shiny mirrors, right?    [00:10:00] >> Yeah, so if you see the entire space craft when it's fully deployed, it has the three big segments to it.    [00:10:04] >> Yes.    [00:10:05] >> One they call the spacecraft bus, which is like most satellites, it's got all the communications, the power, the cooling, everything that is requiring a lot of energy, and it is facing the sun and earth, and then of course, you have the separation of that huge sunshield.  The sunshield is like the size of a tennis court when it's fully deployed.  You know, bigger, it's got five layers of aluminized Kapton, and that separates of course the sun and earth and moon from the last part, which is the telescope element, which we call Otis right now, which stands for OTE and ISIM, OTE being Optical Telescope Element, and ISIM being Integrated Science Instrument Module, and the two of them make OTE, because at NASA just love to take acronyms and turn them into more acronyms.    [00:10:50] >> Yeah, why not [laughter].    [00:10:51] >> So that is the portion that actually has the primary mirror.  So OTE is the optics.  So the primary mirror.  That is 18 large hexagonal segments.  The secondary mirror, which is a smaller, probably still almost size of Hubble, but you know, a large-- no, not that, sorry about a two foot in diameter, another brilliant mirror that all the light is focused on, and then it goes through the center, and has a tertiary mirror.  From there, it goes back and is the-- that tertiary mirror will send it to one of the science instruments.    [00:11:27] >> Okay.    [00:11:27] >> And so you have five different science instruments, one delivered by the Canadians, the fine guidance system, two delivered by the Europeans, and then two were developed by NASA in the United States, so...    [00:11:38] >> All right, so very international kind of collaboration going on, and behind the scenes there, so it goes, tertiary right?  So mirror, mirror, mirror, and then it's sending it to all of these great instruments to measure different things.    [00:11:51] >> Yeah.  So it's a reflective mirror.  So all the lights collected on the primary, focused off a secondary and passed back through, versus like the old tube style, where it's strictly just lights coming through and passing from one to the next, and focused on a final source, you know.    [00:12:05] >> Okay.  So that first set of mirrors is like you said there, that hexagonal shape, they're just a series of gold-looking hexagons all kind of fitted together.    [00:12:13] >> Correct.    [00:12:13] >> So what was the design logic behind that?  Why the hexagons?    [00:12:17] >> It looks super cool, but-- when you need a mirror that big, it's really hard to produce a single monolith.    [00:12:24] >> Ah.    [00:12:25] >> So, even on the ground, there's like if you go to some other observatories that are more modern, that they're segmented, even, you know, ground things out like a Keck observatory in Hawaii, they have large mirrors that they've patched together, and hexagons make nice ability to kind of fit things in a nice shape, and essentially get, not necessarily a circle, but you can get the area you want covered pretty well, and make them in segments that are large, but not so big that they're difficult to manufacture.    [00:13:01] >> Okay.    [00:13:02] >> And then the other big thing is you know, Hubble is like two and a half meters in diameter, 2.4, or something.    [00:13:09] >> Okay.    [00:13:09] >> I don't know, it's larger than 2 meters.    [00:13:12] >> Yeah.    [00:13:13] >> And like James Webb is like six and a half meters in diameter.  So it's significantly bigger you know, Hubble was all polished glass.  This one is a, you know, lightweight beryllium.  They used beryllium because it's really stiff, it has a great thermal performance, so you know, you know it has to get cold, beryllium tends to be very consistent as it cools down or heats up and to go to the right shape, where you think like, an aluminum pan, heating, cooling, it might bend and warp.    [00:13:44] >> Yeah.    [00:13:45] >> Beryllium, you know, all metals kind of change shape a little bit, but beryllium is very consistent in holding its shape, so we know they're actually perfect mirrors when they're cryogenic, and they're not perfect mirrors right now at room temperature, and that was one of the things we had to do here at Johnson was to test it that way, but-- so you know, that was one of the reasons for using the beryllium, and then of course, the gold coating was put on there, because gold does a great job of reflecting infrared light.  So...    [00:14:13] >> Okay.    [00:14:14] >> Yeah, not absorbing the wavelength they're really looking for.  So.    [00:14:17] >> All right.  So that's an interesting point, the way that they're designed is to be imperfect here, so when you're testing it, they're imperfect because you know once it gets to space where you want it to do all of its work is actually going to form into the mirror that you want it to be.    [00:14:33] >> Correct.  When it gets down to below, you know, 40 Kelvin it's essentially a perfect mirror, and that was one of the technologies that was developed on that, was you know, they polished them as perfect mirrors.  They were tested at Huntsville, at the XRS CF chamber, which is where Chandah was originally tested, which wasn't big enough to test the entire telescope like we had at Johnson, but it was big enough that they could test the mirror segments.    [00:15:00] >> Okay.    [00:15:00] >> And map them, when they mapped them at cold temperatures, you could see, oh yeah, now it warped and moved, and is imperfect.  They took it back.  Purposefully polished in the imperfections.  Took them back to Huntsville, and tested them again, and showed that once they got to temperature, that imperfection they put into the mirror turned out to be a perfect mirror at the right temperature, if that makes sense.    [00:15:23] >> [Laughs] Yeah, no totally makes sense, you've got to design it for, you know, its ultimate destination and right now I'm sure you're looking at it just like, ah, I want you to be perfect, but--    [00:15:31] >> The other, sorry, going back to your first question--    [00:15:33] >> Yeah, sure.    [00:15:34] >> About the hexagonal shape, the other big part of that is also, you know, it's launching in a rocket ferring.    [00:15:39] >> Yeah.    [00:15:39] >> You know, you've got an area in 5, it's a 5 meter ferring, and you've got a primary mirror that is six and a half meters in diameter so it's bigger than the rocket it's going on, and the ferring, so you had to be able to come up with a design where you would fold those wings in, and fold the whole telescope up, so that it would fit in the rocket ferring, and then of course deploy in space, so...    [00:16:01] >> That's actually an interesting topic, is just the whole deployment secrets because it's kind of-- it's going to, like you said, fold in on itself, and then you're going to put it in this rocket and launch it, so actually before I go into the unfolding, where is it going to go?    [00:16:14] >> So after it leaves Northrup Grumman, part of the European agreement is they're providing the rocket, which is an Arian 5, it's launching out of French Guyana in South America.    [00:16:25] >> Okay.    [00:16:26] >> So that's its next last destination here on earth.    [00:16:30] >> Yeah.    [00:16:31] >> And before it starts observing the cosmos.    [00:16:34] >> Yeah [laughs], and then go out to is it-- a Lagrange Point?  Or...    [00:16:37] >> Correct.    [00:16:38] >> And which one?    [00:16:39] >> So it's an earth sun Lagrange Point 2.    [00:16:41] >> Okay.    [00:16:42] >> So that is about a million miles, about a million and a half kilometers on the backside of the earth, away from the sun.  So it will orbit the sun with the earth.  And it has about a half million mile diameter loop that it's doing.  I think about 8,000 kilometers around that gravitational point.  So it looks like, from the earth, it's doing this small circle, but from the sun, it's kind of doing a small sign wave.    [00:17:05] >> Oh, okay.    [00:17:06] >> If you see it.  And so it does require a little bit of energy, but it's not perfectly staying out at one spot.  It's kind of doing this really slow orbit around that Lagrange point.    [00:17:18] >> Okay.    [00:17:18] >> And it's a great place to be, because one, you're way out there, they're very thermally stable, because your view of the earth and the moon and the sun don't really affect its thermal performance much like you would if you're low earth orbit and once side you're on the sun, and the next time you're pretty well shaded.  Basic, you know, this thing is pretty well, the part that is looking at Earth, we know the thermal input that it's going to see, in solar and then we know the backside of that sun shield, so it's also very clean.  Much cleaner than, you know, low earth orbit in terms of micro meteoroids and objects like that.    [00:17:53] >> Ah, right.    [00:17:54] >> And it's very stable, you know, and of course the big thing too is now we're not orbiting the earth and having to protect the optics, you're just looking for as long as you want to look, and so, you know, you have to-- you're going around the sun and have to decide, okay what's my next object I'm going to look at, so--    [00:18:10] >> That's right because that sun shield is just going to be facing, you know, towards the sun the whole time, kind of blocking the light coming straight from the sun, so you've got this nice, clear view, nothing, nothing obstructing your view, and then you can kind of point it wherever you need, as long as it's not, you know, directly at the sun [laughs].    [00:18:25] >> Correct, correct, yeah.    [00:18:28] >> So, but that unfolding sequence is going to be kind of cool, right, because if you look at it, it's just like this giant mirror kind of hexagon, gold thing, and it's going to unfold into that shape, and then the pole comes out, the sunshields deploy.  That's going to be quite a sequence, right?    [00:18:46] >> Yeah, actually the sun shields are some of the early large deployments that happen.    [00:18:50] >> Sweet.    [00:18:51] >> So yeah, launches, you know, first thing it does is it deploys its solar panels, starts making sure it has got plenty of energy for the rest of the trip and for the rest of the actuations, and then you know, antennas and stuff like that deploy pretty early on as well for communication purposes, and then you know, yeah, you've got that sunshield, that's, like I said, probably the size of a basketball court, tennis court, it's massive when it's fully deployed.  All folded up into something that is, you know, probably less than, like I said, three or four meters in diameter, and you're going, you know, so you know, has to unfold, deploy all the sunshields, then because of the temperature difference, we actually have a deployable tower that separates the mirror from the spacecraft bus, and then it helps provide, again, a long length for some thermal isolation there.    [00:19:46] >> Oh!    [00:19:46] >> And then once all that is done then, you know, the secondary mirror would deploy, and the primary mirror would finish out.  And then there's a few more radiators on the actual spacecraft by the science instrument, on the telescope portion that would continue to do some deployments until it's out there.  But there's about two weeks of deployments.  I think there's 183 actuators that are going off, I mean it's a lot.    [00:20:14] >> Yeah.    [00:20:15] >> Things happening and a lot of anxiety [laughter] to go out there, it takes about 30 days to actually get from French Guyana to L2.    [00:20:24] >> Okay.    [00:20:25] >> So it's like 29--    [00:20:26] >> Thirty days to get to L2, and then--    [00:20:29] >> Yeah, about a month.    [00:20:30] >> And then you've got another how long until it's fully deployed?    [00:20:34] >> So on its way out there it is deploying.    [00:20:36] >> Oh, I see.    [00:20:36] >> So yeah, it's doing most of its major deployments on its way out there, allowing the mirrors to cool, and--    [00:20:42] >> Okay.    [00:20:43] >> And so yeah, you've got about two weeks of hoping everything goes well, and then like I said, another month to make sure it's actually getting into the right orbit, or about a month to make sure it's in the right orbit, and then from there it starts taking images, and then hopefully the scientists will tell us when they think they've seen the first light of the universe and start sending back really cool pictures.    [00:21:09] >> Yes, I'm very excited for that for sure, but I'm sure that whole trip is going to be very, very stressful [laughter].    [00:21:15] >> Yeah.    [00:21:16] >> A lot going on there.  But just the mission itself is just phenomenal, like what it's trying to do, and then the amount of work going into it, just all over the U.S. and is it being tested outside the U.S. too, or is it just being launched from outside the U.S.?    [00:21:32] >> It's just being launched from outside the U.S., so like I said, two of the science instruments were delivered by corporations under ESO, so European companies, and so they were-- you know, they had to go through their own certification program, but they were eventually all integrated into the final science package, and that went through its thermal document testing up by Goddard--    [00:21:55] >> Oh, okay.    [00:21:55] >> So yeah, they're SES chamber there, and like I said, a lot of the meter development work was done using Hubble, I mean, excuse me, the Chandah facility there, the XRCF at Huntsville.    [00:22:06] >> Okay.    [00:22:07] >> The mirrors have traveled all over the United States, you know, mirrors, technology was really, I think developed by Ball Aerospace in Boulder, Colorado.  They did testing there as well.  So, I mean the mirrors went from the company that polished them in California and San Francisco to testing at Huntsville, to be back to California to be re-polished, to testing in Huntsville, to be fully integrated with all their actuators to be tested at Huntsville, to be, you know, sent to Goddard, to be integrated as a system, then, you know, down here to Johnson, out to Northrup Grumman, and so I mean, the mirrors have traveled the United States, and you know, quite a bit, and like I said, then like I said the science instruments, some were from Germany, the Netherlands, and Ireland, were all in collaboration as part-- under ESA to deliver stuff, and then the Canadian space agency delivered a fine guidance system.  Those parts were tested up in Ottawa, at their CSA facility there, in their chamber, so--    [00:23:12] >> Wow.    [00:23:13] >> So a lot of work throughout the United States on this.    [00:23:17] >> Yes.    [00:23:17] >> KPL is managing the cryocooler that is used for the mirror instrument, and that is the longest wavelength that they're going to be looking at.    [00:23:24] >> Okay.    [00:23:25] >> And so it's the coldest, so it actually runs about 5, 6, 7 degrees Kelvin.    [00:23:30] >> Whew!  All right!    [00:23:30] >> And yeah, when we were doing our testing we were at 20 degrees, so you know it's like minus 4, 23 Fahrenheit, there, really close to absolute zero.    [00:23:38] >> Yeah!    [00:23:38] >> So yeah, looking at really long, older wavelengths.  And you know, that's stuff that has never been observed before, would be really interesting to see what shows up in that spectra, so.    [00:23:48] >> Exactly.  It's just amazing what you can find just from some of these telescopes now, I mean, they're discovering planets just by these small dips in light and you can discover, you know, planets now, there's hundreds of exoplanets that have been discovered all over the universe, so looking at the beginning of the universe and things that have not been looked at before, it's just an exciting concept.    [00:24:09] >> Yeah, you know, and speaking of that, of course, one of the science objectives of James Webb now is looking at planets.  Not necessarily looking for planets, but it would look at planets, be able to-- it's going to look within our solar system for traces of water, and carbon type structures, on the different planets, and how, you know, maybe some type of ring that maybe exists within our solar system, then be able to look for that in other solar systems, and go oh!  There's signs of, you know, life-giving properties around the solar system, and then it can also look at planets, and look at the spectra around that, and tell you maybe what an atmosphere is made of, and hopefully, like I said, maybe discover a planet that has water, nitrogen, oxygen, type of you know, things that would show signs of life, you know, carbon dioxide and things like that.    [00:24:55] >> Okay that's exciting [laughter].    [00:24:57] >> It's really exciting, yeah, yeah.  So yeah, so it's, you know, it's got that kind of the four major science objectives, you know, the first light, the evolution of galaxies, birth of stars, and the existence of possible life on exoplanets, and stuff like that.    [00:25:18] >> Wow.  Yeah!    [00:25:18] >> So science tool, really, hopefully will expand our human knowledge of what our universe is and what's around us and our solar system and galaxy and beyond, so--    [00:25:30] >> Unbelievable.  What a resume for the James Webb space telescope [laughter] to say what you're going to accomplish.  But you kind of hinted toward some of the testing already, and just all these parts coming, you know, first of all, traveling all over the U.S., but then all coming together.  You know, what's the story there?  You have all these different places, I'm sure they're manufactured in different places, right?    [00:25:52] >> Correct, so yeah, so you know, Goddard is where the program is managed out of, the project office is managed out of.    [00:26:01] >> Okay.    [00:26:02] >> You know, they're responsible for pulling it all together.  Well they, again, this telescope element, they pulled all that together, so you know, all the science instruments and the ISIM package was delivered to Goddard, they tested it.  And then all the components that make up the telescope were delivered there, and our [inaudible] facility, which is their huge clean room, they assembled James Webb.  So it's got the carbon fiber back plane, all the radiators, all the wiring was done, you know, everything was finally assembled there, and they'd all been tested at component level, but never tested at a system level.  So, they did test it at a system level, in terms of just its vibe and acoustic, to make sure it could survive, you know, launch--    [00:26:42] >> Yes.    [00:26:43] >> But they could never test a full optical path and everything like that.  So that was one of the main reasons of coming to the Johnson Space Center, as here is where you could actually simulate where it's going to be out in orbit, and now that you've tested all these other smaller components, and smaller chambers, you know, you could test a full system in a large thermal vacuum chamber, and still get to the deep space thermal conditions and vacuum conditions, and so--    [00:27:08] >> Yeah, so it got all assembled, all these different components tested, you know, use that other component levels, constructed at Goddard, and then from Goddard it was tested, and then it went to Johnson or did it kind of go around from there?  If it's-- so it's right from Goddard to Johnson.    [00:27:22] >> So yeah, so this large portion of the telescope went from Goddard to Johnson and from Johnson it's going to Northrup Grumman, so this is its last time it is with NASA when it leaves here.    [00:27:33] >> Oh really?    [00:27:34] >> Yeah, from there it goes to Northrup Grumman, who is the prime contractor, to be integrated with the rest of it, and like I said, it goes from there to the European space agency's launch facility at French Guyana, but yeah, so it's kind of a mixed feelings, I mean, you know, it has been nice having it here at two different NASA centers for the last few years, but it's--    [00:27:56] >> All right so it did, you said, acoustic testing at Goddard, right?    [00:28:00] >> Correct.    [00:28:01] >> And just to make sure the launch is going to be okay and everything kind of checked out there, right?  So--    [00:28:05] >> Yeah, the vibe and acoustic was a very big deal, you spend lots of money then shake something really hard that you treat with, you know, kid gloves [laughter] for all the rest of the time, and now you're-- you see this test where you're actually just shaking it, and parts are just going all over and then you at least do some type of verification to make sure everything looks like it has survived and ready to go, so--    [00:28:26] >> All right, and they got the thumbs up, and then it came here.    [00:28:29] >> Then it came here.    [00:28:29] >> All right, so then what the big question, you know, your area of expertise, what was the testing that went on here?  How did that, when did it come in and all that kind of stuff?    [00:28:38] >> I'm not sure how far back you want to go but [laughter]--    [00:28:41] >> Be here forever.    [00:28:42] >> Yeah, so the flight article got here in May of last year.    [00:28:46] >> Okay.    [00:28:46] >> May 2017, but we had been working with Goddard probably from 2004 in terms of hey this looks like the right chamber to do what we need to do for a thermal vacuum test, you know, but they had really different requirements from what the chamber was originally designed for, which was Apollo.    [00:29:06] >> Yeah.    [00:29:06] >> They've got contamination, vibration, and the thermal and test duration were way different than what Apollo needed, which was fast, fairly quick, redundant type of testing with human rated, you know, really protecting the crew and the capsule, and doing a thermal simulation of going to the moon and back.  And you know, here, they're like, you know, they don't care about the heat.  I mean, we did, because we did need to test the sunshield and some of those thermal paths, and we did do that in Chamber A, but for the most part, the telescope all have seen just the cold of space, and that's what we simulated for that.    [00:29:45] >> Okay, I should probably ask, what's Chamber A?    [00:29:48] >> So, yeah, Chamber A is a large thermal vacuum chamber here at the Johnson Space Center, in Building 32.  So there's two chambers in that building, A and B, you know, both were Apollo era chambers, and have continued to serve NASA over the years.  Chamber A is ten times the volumetric size of Chamber B, and it's about 65 feet in diameter, about 120 feet from top to bottom.    [00:30:15] >> Wow, it's huge!    [00:30:16] >> Yeah, it's huge!  So James Webb was in a shroud that was about 45 feet in diameter, and about 70 feet tall.  That put it in the thermal conditions it needed.  Like I said, in there, we made a lot of modifications, both from the Johnson side, and from Harris, which was formerly kind of Kodak was responsible for the optical testing, so we integrated all kinds of optical test equipment into the chamber as we were constructing some of that and testing it through the years, so that we are kind of starting about 14 really commissioning the chamber, and starting to integrate the-- in commissioning the GSC, and then doing a test series we call the pathfinder, from in 15 and 16, that really had a-- the engineering unit of James Webb, with the two primary mirrors, secondary mirror, and a way to kind of at least pick up light where the science instruments were.    [00:31:14] >> So we could do a full series of testing to test the system, and verify that we were going to be testing the telescope and not the equipment we designed to test the telescope.    [00:31:26] >> Yes!    [00:31:27] >> So yeah, it kind of was a shakedown series of tests.  We learned a lot from that too.  To really kind of reduce risk, change our plans of operations, and just improve our system reliability and stuff like that.    [00:31:41] >> Yeah!    [00:31:41] >> So it was really helpful!    [00:31:43] >> [Laughs] So you kind of put this sort of, I guess \"pretend\" James Webb inside to see, all right, let's see how this reacts and get it ready for the real James Webb, because like you said, Chamber A was not designed to test James Webb, it was designed for human missions, and they put human vehicles in there, I think the lunar module, and stuff like that, right?  They actually tested?    [00:32:07] >> In Chamber B, yeah.    [00:32:08] >> In Chamber B, they tested?  The lunar module?    [00:32:10] >> Yeah, Chamber A was the service command module so that's where you had, yeah, but Skylab was in Chamber A as well.    [00:32:15] >> Oh, okay.    [00:32:15] >> And then of course it has continued its use for just, you know, development of shuttle and space station and stuff like that, in terms of more hardware than human testing, so--    [00:32:26] >> Yeah.    [00:32:26] >> So you know, whenever you need a large thermal vacuum chamber, it's one of the very few that exists, so you know, it's a great asset for NASA to have something like that.    [00:32:36] >> So you started gearing it up for James Webb testing in 2014 you said or was it before that?    [00:32:42] >> So we had to modify the chamber quite a bit.  And the big years for that were in 2009, through about 2012.    [00:32:48] >> Oh okay.    [00:32:48] >> We actually replaced the pumping systems, especially the high vacuum systems, because all of them were, had oil type of system, or oil within them or an oil pumping system.  Everything, we couldn't have any type of oils around James Webb.  So everything went through like a real clean, newer technologies.  Our thermal systems used to only kind of get to about 100 Kelvin, and we needed to be able to get to about 15 Kelvin, and then, of course, we ended up just testing at 20 Kelvin for James Webb, but still we wanted to be able to, you know, kind of exceed that requirement or meet it, so 15 was kind of what we thought we'd need to-- so we had to put a different shroud in, and use helium as the cryogen for cooling it down instead of like the 100 Kelvin that is probably more liquid nitrogen type stuff, but with that, too, you know, the chamber had no vibration isolation, so at the top of the chamber now, we have a series of vibration isolators, everything was suspended in the chamber, so when we were testing James Webb, all its primary optical test equipment was sitting above it that was mapping the mirrors, that was reflecting the light, and then the telescope was hanging below, and then all that was in a single kind of optical bench system that was supported outside the chamber on these vibration isolators, and the nice thing is that sitting down below that, so the mass is well below the vibration isolation, and one of the nice things, still about Houston is we didn't have zero issues with vibration.   [00:34:20] We definitely had some issues with vibration, but because we're not on bedrock, we sit on like [chuckling] you know, mud and gumbo.  Yeah, you know, we can park a tractor trailer on the backside of the building and take LM2, and we don't tend to see any of those vibrations carrying through to the chamber, so--    [00:34:39] >> Oh!    [00:34:40] >> So that was a, you know, a big, kind of deciding factor versus a facility that is built on bedrock, and you can feel things from all over and miles and miles away, and it's really hard to get a quiet environment.  We kind of-- there's not a lot of benefits, I think, like I said yeah, swamp, but it worked really good in terms of creating a real quiet atmosphere for testing.    [00:35:02] >> Yeah, so that was one of the selling points, then for bringing it to Johnson was, you know the fact that it's not sitting on Bedrock, the fact that it can provide a quieter and less vibrating kind of environment.    [00:35:13] >> Yeah, absolutely, I think that you know, the quiet environment, the size of the chamber was this Goldilocks in terms of the focal points, focal length of the primary mirror system, so we were able to design reflective mirrors at the top of the chamber, and have what we call the center of curvature optical assembly, which was the main piece of test hardware in the chamber, that did the mapping using interferometry of the primary mirrors, and make sure that, yeah, like I said, these 18 segments that are-- we started them all in like a launch lock position, they have to release, and they have to kind of move and act as a monolithic mirror, so you got-- that was a big thing we had to test is, hey, will this thing go to its right shape and make sure that it looks like a monolithic mirror, and not a bunch of individual mirrors or ones out of phase, or something like that.  Yeah, because then you won't get a clear image, right?    [00:36:06] >> Yeah, clear image, or you're losing some of the capacity of like some of the mirrors are not, you know, reacting correctly, so--    [00:36:13] >> So a lot of new technology was developed on those algorithms, and the software to position and tell the mirror like how to behave, so it was, it was very successful.  Like I said, it was very successful, but really extremely complex, probably one of the most complex thermal vacuum tests that have ever been carried out.    [00:36:33] >> Yeah, like you said, years in the making, you started conversations in 2004, and by 2009, you were already getting this thing ready to go for James Webb, right?    [00:36:41] >> Yeah, we were, yeah tons of metal was cut and thrown away and new [laughter] equipment was coming in so...    [00:36:47] >> Yeah, and not just the thermal vacuum chamber, right?  You were also doing the area outside to be a clean room too.    [00:36:56] >> Correct, so that kind of started right after we finished the chamber in 12, kind of the clean room picked up in early 13, and well, that happened pretty fast.  I think by sometime in the middle of 14 that was done.  And like I said, really has been an exceptional clean room, we were given a certain, you know, budget for how dirty the mirrors could get while they're sitting here, you know the longer something sits around, it's going to just collect, and you know, you're given this budget, and we actually stayed well under that budget.  Of course we were able to use this last, probably week and a half to do a final cleaning of the mirrors prior to it being shipped to Northrup Grumman, so it's leaving Johnson cleaner than when it arrived, so that's pretty amazing.    [00:37:39] >> That's awesome.    [00:37:40] >> Yeah.    [00:37:40] >> I'm sure, well, so I'm trying to imagine the environment that you guys are in, so you're testing it, you're in this clean room, everything is like super spotless, probably one of the cleanest places in the known universe [laughter], I don't know but it's super clean.  You guys are kind of outfitted with these white garments, right, that are head to toe, make sure no dust or hair or anything is getting on these mirrors.    [00:38:02] >> Yeah and usually, you know, human, you know dust, is typically like, you know, some type of human fallout type of thing, so you know, hair, skin cells, and other things like that, are probably the major sources of dust, so yeah, reducing that and monitoring that is a big deal, and of course everything on the spacecraft is real ESD, so everybody is outfitted with, you know, electrostatic type of wristbands when they're working on anything around there.  You know, so yeah, it's a full head to toe garment that are [laughter] quite a bit, you know, it takes a good amount of time to get suited up when you go in there.    [00:38:45] >> Yeah, I can imagine!  Especially because of the requirements, that it has to be, you know, what's the level of, like you said, the level of clean that is acceptable.  So and I'm sure that cleaning the mirrors is a whole process in and of itself, right?  You're not just going to be spraying it with Windex and kind of wiping it down, right?    [00:38:58] >> Not that was, you know, the contamination team led out of Goddard, you know, managed that effort, and it was very arduous task, that they mapped each of the mirrors, and you're mapping probably like a few inches at a time, so--    [00:39:14] >> Oh wow!    [00:39:14] >> Yeah, they're cleaning a very small area, black light it, high resolution light it, and look for any type of, you know smudge or any dust particles, and they carefully, like, anytime you could, you know, get a dust particle, try to remove it and with a small brush or something like that, but it was really, I was surprised at how detailed they were and how they handled it, but we're done now, and like I said, all the mirrors are actually quite a bit cleaner now than when it first got here, so.    [00:39:46] >> All right.  So you said now it's kind of wrapped up and ready to ship off to the next place, right?  Or are you still in the process of wrapping it up?    [00:39:53] >> No, no, we completed all the-- so you know, we had the big family day [laughter], that was a huge success and--    [00:39:58] >> Yeah.    [00:39:59] >> The 20th, then we repeat it on the second.  But on the third we really started doing the stowing, you know, the opposite of deployment.  So we stowed the mirror wings.  Stowed the deployable tower, and really got it ready for shipment soon after that, so when once all those stowing sequences were done, we began the cleaning process so really there is not a lot left to do except for take it off its turnover fixture and get it into a shipping container, and that is planned for tomorrow.    [00:40:36] >> Wow, this is exciting!  All this kind of [laughter] preparation you know, you said, talking so early, then kind of preparing the chamber, you did it, you tested it, you did it, you know, like you said under budget, and it was successful so, I mean, actually that is a good question, how did the tests go?    [00:40:52] >> Oh, the tests went really well [laughter], so the thermal vacuum test, the main part test, we call it, the Otis Cryovac Test.  Started in early July and we were under vacuum for about a little over 100 days, so yeah, we had people round the clock.  Even before then, but you know, the people operating our chamber from Johnson were probably on shift for about 102, 103 days.  Took about 30 days to cool the spacecraft down to its flight like-- took 30 days for the chamber to get down to temperature, it could have gotten much faster, but this provided the profile they needed.    [00:41:36] >> Okay.    [00:41:36] >> It took about 40 some days for the telescope to really start getting down to its flight like temperatures and start doing, start firing up the science instruments, which were really sensitive to heat, and stuff like that.    [00:41:49] >> Yes.    [00:41:50] >> Of course once we were down and just get cold, you know, Harvey shows up and--    [00:41:57] >> Oh!  That beast!    [00:41:58] >> Yeah, so, but it was-- we had a lot of plans in place, and we executed those plans, and got a lot of support from the center to keep things going and a lot of support from Goddard.  Everybody kind of pulled together, unfortunately.  Some people didn't get to go home for many, many days--    [00:42:15] >> Oh no!    [00:42:16] >> Because they couldn't find a path to their home or--    [00:42:20] >> That's right, a lot of the gates were--    [00:42:22] >> Yeah, relief could not leave their homes and get to work, so, but we had a lot of preparations for people to be able to do that, and from the Goddard perspective, you know, their team was here, locally and in hotels, and they were able to get some of the best optical testing done during that time, so--    [00:42:39] >> Wow!    [00:42:40] >> Yeah, yeah, so all the optical tests were done, I think they exceeded their requirements on all their stuff as well, so they really feel like the performance of the telescope is great.  They're delivering a product now that they really believe is going to do its mission.    [00:42:56] >> Fantastic, yeah, you have been kind of through the wringer since it's been here, huh?  You had Harvey and just like last week we had that ice storm, so yeah, you've really encountered a couple challenges, but you did it.  That's-- that's quite an accomplishment.  That's really cool.    [00:43:09] >> Thank you.  Yeah, it's been a huge-- the team here at Johnson has been very dedicated to the success of the mission and the team that has been down here, the international team, we've had hundreds of people from ESA and stuff supporting this, and everyone is extremely dedicated and really believes in what they're doing, so.    [00:43:29] >> All right.  That is so awesome, so I kind of wanted to clarify one point is, you know, I think we kind of just sort of skipped over it, but Chamber A is unique in the fact that, or maybe not unique and you can clarify this, it's a thermal vacuum chamber.    [00:43:44] >> Correct.    [00:43:44] >> So not only does it bring it down to, you know, the pressure of space, but it's also bringing it down like you said 15 Kelvin, but I guess you're testing it at 20 Kelvin.    [00:43:52] >> Yeah.    [00:43:53] >> Super cold.  I don't think people understand how cold that is, 20 Kelvin.    [00:43:58] >> Yeah so 20 Kelvin is about -423 Fahrenheit, I mean, it's cold enough that the only molecules that are moving are probably some hydrogen and helium and maybe some neon, and there is not much of that, because we have some pumps that work really well to try to get rid of that, those molecules, so there's not a lot of-- we just tell people like, when we're at room-- sea level pressure, there is about 30,000 pounds of air in that chamber, so you know, you think air doesn't have that much mass, when we're down at test temperatures, there is the mass of about a half staple in the chamber [laughter], that's what the mass of all that air is remining, so to create that space-like environment.  And then like I said temperature wise, like I said all the nitrogen, oxygen are normal air you breathe, instantly freezes out when it comes in contact with the surface that cold.    [00:44:57] >> Whoa!    [00:44:57] >> So it's just really cold [laughter], it's hard to imagine, you know, yeah, there's not much moving around at those temperatures.    [00:45:06] >> Yeah, it's just kind of when you say it the way that you say it, it's kind of surprising to think that anything works in that kind of environment, but if you think about it, there is, you know, satellites and probes all over the solar system that we've been sending, and now we are just, this is just, this is another one that is a little bit, you know it's big, and it's got a lot of-- it's got a lot of elements to it, but the fact that it is, you know, you can fire up the instruments and they worked, right?    [00:45:29] >> Oh yeah.    [00:45:30] >> The instruments--    [00:45:32] >> Yeah, all the instruments worked.    [00:45:34] >> Yeah.    [00:45:35] >> You know, so a lot of the instruments had been tested, the package was tested at Goddard, like I said, but you know, never tested as a system where, and same with the primary optics, they'd never been fully assembled and tested as a system so it was really a big deal to be able to test the primary mirror, make sure the primary mirror is acting correctly, then the secondary mirror, then actually send light all the way to the science instruments, and you know, oh yeah, you had a simulated star, and it is tracking it correctly, and it is what you simulate and are sending is what is being received, and so now you know all the elements are where they're supposed to be, and in focus, and you know, because you're talking a little, you know, probably...the thickness of a hair was way out of focus for a mirror like this, you know, so everything has got to be really tight alignment, so.    [00:46:26] >> Yeah, yeah.  Like literally 99% on this test is an F, so yeah [laughter].    [00:46:32] >> Yeah, that's a good way of putting it.    [00:46:33] >> Yeah, so that's kind of cool, you simulated it looking at a star, as like you kind of, all right, put it through this pretend environment.  Not only are you testing if it can survive the pressure and the cold, but also let's fire everything up and see if this thing can actually see stars.    [00:46:50] >> Correct, yeah, yeah.  You know, like I said, the first thing we had to do is of course make sure the primary mirrors look like a monolith.    [00:46:58] >> Yes.    [00:46:58] >> And then once those things we know, yeah, okay that looks right now, the primary mirrors and secondary mirror, are they aligned together, and then the tertiary mirror, then the science instruments, you know, and the thing has got a small amount of movement to be able to correct, you know, that type of stuff, because everything is moving a little bit, and with the temperature, so that's a big difference between this and Hubble.  This, all the mirrors have some degrees of freedom to be able to slightly move, so they've got actuators on them, allowing you to adjust their focus, or adjust their position slightly.  And so that was part of the testing was being able to make sure that all that does, works, and then some of the more challenging testing is what we, you know, would be like a pass and a half where we actually had like a fiberoptic that would simulate like a star, a point of light, and you would bounce that off the primary mirror or off the secondary mirror, back off the primary mirror, off our test mirrors, at the top of the chamber called auto-collimating flats, and then back through that entire path, then to a science instrument [laughter], so everything had to pass at least the primary optics twice, and some of the, you know, off the science instruments you know, once, and like I said any slight vibration or anything like that disturbs the image, and so you know, you had that-- everything worked really well, like I said, you don't realize hoe a little bit of shaking or something like that can really blur a point of light when you're trying to look at a few photons and stuff like that, that the telescope is supposed to be observing, so.    [00:48:31] >> Yeah, that's right, and you got an A on that test right [laughter].    [00:48:34] >> Yeah, I mean, everything-- I'm not an optical guy, but it was kind of fun to come in every day, we had typically every afternoon we had meetings, and we could hear the optical guys, like that's the first time we ever tested this?  Yeah!  And you're like almost every day was like a party during the test because [laughter] it was the first time they had done system level tests and completed an objective that, you know, they're very excited, like the performance.    [00:49:00] >> All right, I should have been hanging out with you guys every day as a party, that's pretty cool [laughter].  Cool.  But yeah, just to see the things, like you said, that you've been working on for so long, to come together, and you fire them up and they work, I can see that being like oh my gosh, yes!  Yes!  This is doing what I wanted it to do!    [00:49:15] >> Yeah!  And that was like, so on the from the Johnson Space Center standpoint, it's kind of almost a little bit benign, because we had already wrung out our chamber and created-- got rid of a lot of issues we had there, so you know, we were able to create this environment, like when we had the hurricane came, and all the rains and floods, we had some issues with the building, but the telescope never knew anything was going on [laughter] because all the facility systems operated as we wanted them to, and we really never lost anything, so you know, it wasn't the same excitement for us as it was for the telescope, because we had ben doing a series of testing, and got rid of all our bugs, so it's almost like one of those things, like boring testing from creating the environment, and doing all that is a good thing because we don't want to be testing any of our stuff out, or having any issues with our stuff, when we're really trying to test the telescope at this point, so it was great to ring all that out, and see their excitement, as they were able to test the telescope and really get to an understanding to really prove that optically it is working as they expected, and all the little requirements that pass down from some type of science objective, were met.   [00:50:23] So--    [00:50:23] >> Yes, and that means that you did your job, right?  You provided the environment for these guys.  So.    [00:50:29] >> Yeah, the team here at Johnson did.    [00:50:31] >> Yes, you and your team.  Absolutely.  Fantastic.  Very exciting!  So you're wrapping up testing, it's all wrapped up and ready to go off to its next point, so what are the next steps until it is launched?  It's going to Northrup Grumman next?    [00:50:44] >> Yeah, it goes to Northrup Grumman, and at Northrup Grumman it would be integrated with the sunshield and the spacecraft bus.  Once it's integrated, I think it there goes through a series of vibe and acoustic tests, then they have to do a deployment test, one more time, they really want to make sure that after they simulate a launch, you can do the deployments.  The sad thing about it is that it probably takes about two months to re-stow everything, you know, it's really, you know, a lot of inspections along the way to make sure that everything is folded back correctly.    [00:51:20] >> Yes.    [00:51:20] >> And all the actuators are reset correctly and then it should be ready to ship out to the launch pad from there.    [00:51:29] >> All right, so one more stop and then it goes off to launch.  And when are we ending for again?    [00:51:33] >> We are no earlier than March of 19, which would probably be more like summer time I'm thinking and 19 is probably where it's landing.    [00:51:42] >> Okay, all right.  Very exciting!  Yes!    [00:51:44] >> It is, it is.    [00:51:45] >> Then it's going to go out to L2, and we're going to see the beginnings of the universe, and all those, that awesome resume of cool things [laughter] exoplanets, the formations of galaxies, and you said stars too right?    [00:51:56] >> Yeah, I'm expecting to see, like same things you saw from Hubble.    [00:52:00] >> Yeah.    [00:52:00] >> You're going to start seeing coming from James Webb, and lots of physicists are going to hopefully just see stuff that they didn't even expect to see [laughter] and try to explain it to us, so I'm really excited about what it's going to do, and--    [00:52:14] >> Fantastic.  Well, Jonathan thank you so much for coming on, I know this is kind of at the end of your testing cycle, and you just have a couple more days until you can say yes!  Done!  [Laughter] And hands off!  So I really appreciate you coming in while it's still here, and you are kind of, I can see the excitement where you're like yes!  We did it!  I mean, there's still steps to go, but congratulations to you and your team for the successful testing here, and I just can't wait to see this thing launch, and see the beautiful images come back.    [00:52:42] >> Thank you, I'm excited as well.    [00:52:44] >> Awesome.    [00:52:45] [ Music and Inaudible Speaking ]    [00:53:09] >> Hey!  Thanks for sticking around.  So today we talked about the James Webb space telescope that was here just about two weeks ago at this point, and we just wrapped up testing here in Houston, but it's off to Northrup Grumman, and there's a lot of testing ahead, but eventually it will be launching into space, and sending some beautiful images back to earth.  So if you want to see some of the cool testing going on with Webb throughout its journey until its launch next year, you can go to NASA.gov/web.  That's a great resource for all the testing and all of the latest checkmarks and milestones that we're crossing as we get toward that launch point.  You can also go to wwww.jwst.nasa.gov, that is Goddard Space Flight Center, but like Jonathan said, that is where the project was managed out of, so there is pretty cool stuff in there, and it's actually a pretty interactive site.  It's pretty cool.  On social media, we are pretty active, too, in the James Webb space telescope as well, on Facebook, it's NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, or at web telescope.  On Twitter, it's at NASA web, and on Instagram, it's also at NASA web.   [00:54:14] You can find out some of the latest updates there as well, otherwise you can go to the NASA Johnson Space Center sites on any one of those platforms.  We see these all the time, guys, you should be following us by now.  I know you are, because you love us, and we love you.  So here's the hashtag ask NASA on the Johnson Space Center accounts, to submit question or idea for the podcast, and we will make sure to mention it in one of the later episodes.  Just make sure to mention it's for Houston We Have a Podcast.  So this podcast was recorded on January 25, 2018.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, Kelly Humphries, and Jenny Knotts.  Thanks again to Mr. Jonathan Homan for coming on the show.  We'll be back next week.",

        description: ">> HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST. WELCOME TO THE OFFICIAL PODCAST OF THE NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, EPISODE 15: ASTRONAUT PHOTOGRAPHY. I’M GARY JORDAN AND I’LL BE YOUR CO-HOST TODAY, ALONG WITH MEGAN SUMNER, PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER FOR THE ASTRONAUT OFFICE. MEGAN, HOW YOU DOING? >> I’M DOING GOOD. HOW ARE YOU, GARY? >> DOING GREAT. SO MEGAN, TODAY’S EPISODE IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT, BECAUSE WE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH FOUR-- THAT’S RIGHT, FOUR-- ASTRONAUTS IN SPACE. WE TALKED WITH RANDY “KOMRADE” BRESNIK, JOE ACABA, MARK “SABOT” VANDE HEI, AND PAOLO NESPOLI. ALL OF THEM ARE ASTRONAUTS ABOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION FOR EXPEDITION 53, WHICH STARTED BACK IN SEPTEMBER AFTER PEGGY WHITSON, JACK FISCHER, AND FYODOR YURCHIKHIN DEPARTED THE STATION. KOMRADE AND NESPOLI WERE ALREADY UP THERE, AND THEY WERE LATER JOINED BY ACABA AND SABOT, AS WELL AS ALEXANDER MISURKIN. >> THAT’S RIGHT, AND WE TALKED TO ALL FOUR OF THEM LIVE, SO WE BROUGHT IN SOME SOCIAL MEDIA QUESTIONS REAL TIME FOR THE ASTRONAUTS TO ANSWER. >> YES, THANKS TO YOU. WE TALKED ABOUT ASTRONAUT PHOTOGRAPHY, FOR THE MOST PART-- HOW THEY TAKE PICTURES OF EARTH, AND WHAT THEY SEE, AND THE SORT OF EMOTIONS THAT THAT VIEW BRINGS UP. BUT WE ALSO TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SPACEWALKS GOING ON THIS MONTH, AND EDUCATION IN SPACE, AS WELL AS LIFE IN SPACE. SO WITH NO FURTHER DELAY, LET’S GO LIGHTSPEED AND JUMP RIGHT AHEAD TO OUR TALK WITH THE EXPEDITION 53 CREW. ENJOY. [ MUSIC ] >> T MINUS FIVE SECONDS AND COUNTING-- MARK. [ INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ] >> HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST. [ MUSIC ] >> HELLO NASA TV, FACEBOOK LIVE, USTREAM-- WHEREVER YOU ARE WATCHING. WELCOME TO A VERY SPECIAL EPISODE OF “HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST.” SO IF YOU’RE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE PODCAST, THIS IS WHERE WE BRING IN NASA EXPERTS-- SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, ASTRONAUTS-- ALL TO TELL YOU THE COOLEST STUFF ABOUT WHAT’S GOING ON HERE AT NASA. SO TODAY WE HAVE A VERY SPECIAL EPISODE. OF COURSE, YOU CAN SEE US ON CAMERA, AND THIS IS USUALLY AN AUDIO PODCAST. BUT ALSO, WE’RE GOING TO BE TALKING TO SPACE. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME WE’VE DONE THAT. WE’VE DONE IT ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO WITH JACK FISCHER ABOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. AND WE’RE GOING TO DO IT AGAIN WITH SOME ASTRONAUTS, EXCEPT NOT WITH JUST ONE. WE’RE GOING TO DO IT WITH FOUR ASTRONAUTS: RANDY “KOMRADE” BRESNIK, MARK “SABOT” VANDE HEI, JOE ACABA, AND PAOLO NESPOLI. SO I’M NOT GOING TO DO THIS ALONE, OF COURSE. SAME AS ALWAYS, SAME AS BEFORE, I HAVE A CO-HOST WITH ME-- NASA PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER FOR THE ASTRONAUT OFFICE, MEGAN SUMNER. MEGAN, THANKS FOR BEING HERE. >> THANKS, HAPPY TO BE HERE. EXCITED TO TALK TO THEM. >> AWESOME. SO, I MEAN, PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER FOR THE ASTRONAUT OFFICE. NOT THE ONLY ROLE YOU’VE HAD HERE AT NASA, RIGHT? >> MM-HMM, YEAH. I’VE PREVIOUSLY ACTUALLY MANAGED OUR SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS HERE-- THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER ACCOUNTS, AND THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION ACCOUNTS, AND NOW I AM WORKING SUPPORTING THE ASTRO OFFICE FOR APPEARANCES THAT THEY GO OUT AND DO, AND ALSO THE MEDIA SUPPORT. WE HAVE MEDIA COME AND TALK TO THEM BEFORE THEIR MISSIONS, AND DO INTERVIEWS AND MEDIA VISITS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. >> FANTASTIC. AND SO, I THINK THAT’S THE REASON YOU’RE THE PERFECT PERSON TO HAVE AS A CO-HOST WITH ME TODAY IS JUST BECAUSE, FIRST OF ALL, YOU KNOW THE ASTRONAUTS THAT WE’RE TALKING TO TODAY. YOU’VE ACTUALLY WORKED WITH SOME OF THEM IN THE PAST, RIGHT? >> YEAH, SO JOE AND MARK, WHO WE’LL BE TALKING TO TODAY, WERE ACTUALLY THE FIRST TWO ASTRONAUTS THAT I GOT TO WORK WITH IN THIS ROLE AS THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER FOR THE ASTRONAUT OFFICE, SO I’M REALLY EXCITED TO GET TO ACTUALLY TALK TO THEM IN SPACE. >> AWESOME. BUT THEN ALSO, YOU RAN THE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS HERE AT THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER FOR A WHILE, SO THAT’S ANOTHER PART OF THIS IS WE ARE ON FACEBOOK LIVE SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU’D LIKE TO SEND UP TO THE CREW, MEGAN IS GOING TO BE MONITORING THOSE QUESTIONS REAL TIME. SHE’S GOT HER PHONE RIGHT NEXT TO HER AND WE’LL BE ASKING SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS TO OUR FOUR ASTRONAUTS TODAY. SO THE TOPIC OF TODAY’S CONVERSATION IS ASTRONAUT PHOTOGRAPHY. SO WHAT’S THAT ALL ABOUT? >> OH, MAN, THE ASTRONAUTS TAKE THE MOST AMAZING PICTURES FROM THE SPACE STATION AND IT'S JUST AN AMAZING VIEW THAT MOST OF US WILL NEVER GET TO SEE IN OUR LIFETIME. AND THANKFULLY, THEY ARE WILLING TO SHARE THAT VIEW WITH US THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. EASILY THEY CAN SHARE IT OUT TO THE WHOLE WORLD OF WHAT THAT’S LIKE. AND NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THEY’RE SHARING WITH US WHAT THEY’RE DOING IN SPACE AND A LITTLE GLIMPSE INTO THEIR LIFE, THE SCIENCE THEY’RE DOING, ALL THE WORK THEY’RE DOING ON BOARD. SO IT’S SO COOL TO BE ABLE TO SEE THAT PERSPECTIVE. >> ABSOLUTELY. I’M VERY EXCITED FOR THIS TOPIC BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE MORE VISUAL THINGS THAT WE GET TO SEE OF WHAT THE ASTRONAUTS DO ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. OBVIOUSLY, THEY’RE DOING SCIENCE ALL THE TIME AND WE HAVE CREW MEMBERS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY WORKING VARIOUS EXPERIMENTS. AND JUST RECENTLY, THEY'VE BEEN GOING OUT AND DOING A FEW SPACEWALKS SO THEY HAVE MAINTENANCE TASKS THAT THEY REGULARLY DO. BUT RIGHT NOW, WE’RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT ASTRONAUT PHOTOGRAPHY. AND ACTUALLY RIGHT NEXT TO US WE HAVE SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY PRACTICE ON WHENEVER THEY’RE DOING SOME OF THE-- TO ACTUALLY PRACTICE FOR TAKING PHOTOS OF THE EARTH. SO IT LOOKS LIKE OUR ASTRONAUTS ARE ACTUALLY GETTING SET-UP HERE, JUST LIKE THEY DO FOR ANY PUBLIC AFFAIRS EVENT. SO WE’RE GOING TO BE TALKING WITH MISSION CONTROL SOON AND GETTING THAT STARTED. SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ASK THEM BELOW. >> YUP, YUP, WE’RE TAKING YOUR QUESTIONS ON FACEBOOK LIVE. I’LL BE WATCHING AND ASKING THE CREW, SO GET YOUR QUESTION IN THERE AND WATCH ALONG SO YOU CAN HEAR IF THEY GET A CHANCE TO ANSWER IT. >> ABSOLUTELY. ALL RIGHT, LOOKS LIKE OUR FOUR ASTRONAUTS ARE GETTING SET UP RIGHT NOW. LET’S THINK, I MEAN, SO WE HAVE-- WE CAN TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE EXTRAVEHICULAR ACTIVITIES THAT THEY’VE BEEN DOING, SOME OF THE SPACEWALKS AS WELL, BUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR CREW-- RANDY BRESNIK AND JOE ACABA AND PAOLO NESPOLI HAVE BEEN THERE BEFORE. FOR MARK VANDE HEI THIS IS HIS FIRST SPACEFLIGHT, SO WE’LL GET TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE AS BEING A NEWCOMER. ACTUALLY, THREE OF THE ASTRONAUTS WE’VE TALKED TO ON THE PODCAST BEFORE-- RANDY BRESNIK, MARK VANDE HEI, AND JOE ACABA-- ALL EACH INDIVIDUAL EPISODES TO SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES OF WHAT THEY’VE DONE ABOARD. PAOLO NESPOLI, THIS’LL BE THE FIRST TIME TALKING WITH HIM, SO THAT’LL BE A PLEASURE AS WELL. AND HE SHARED SOME FANTASTIC IMAGERY OF ITALY AND JUST DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE EARTH, SO CAN’T WAIT TO SEE WHAT WE’RE DOING THERE. SO LET’S CONNECT WITH MISSION CONTROL, HOUSTON, AND TALK TO OUR FOUR ASTRONAUTS. AGAIN, SEND YOU QUESTIONS BELOW ON FACEBOOK LIVE. >> STATION, THIS IS HOUSTON. ARE YOU READY FOR THE EVENT? >> HOUSTON, WE’RE READY FOR THE EVENT. >> JSC PAO, PLEASE CALL STATION FOR A VOICE CHECK. >> STATION, THIS IS GARY JORDAN AND MEGAN SUMNER IN THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICE. HOW DO YOU HEAR US? >> GARY, WE GOT YOU LOUD AND CLEAR. MEGAN, GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU, TOO. >> ALL RIGHT, WELL THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE TO BE TALKING TO ALL FOUR OF YOU TODAY. I THOUGHT FOR SURE I’D AT LEAST GET TO TALK TO ONE ASTRONAUT, BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL FOUR OF YOU TAKING THE TIME TO TALK TO US TODAY. SO FOR-- A LOT OF YOU HAVE BEEN ON THE PODCAST ALREADY, SO AGAIN, WELCOME BACK. BUT TODAY, WE’RE GOING TO BE DOING A LIVE EVENT SO WE REALLY WANTED TO BRING IN SOME QUESTIONS FROM SOCIAL MEDIA AND HOPING YOU CAN ANSWER THOSE REAL TIME. BUT JUST TO START OFF, BECAUSE THERE ARE FOUR OF YOU, IF YOU CAN JUST SORT OF GIVE A QUICK INTRODUCTION TO ALL OF YOU SO OUR LISTENERS KIND OF KNOW WHO YOU ARE. >> ALL RIGHT, WE’VE GOT EXPEDITION 53 SPACE STATION COMMANDER RANDY BRESNIK. >> EXPEDITION 52, 53 FLIGHT ENGINEER, PAOLO NESPOLI FROM THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY. >> AND EXPEDITION 53 AND 54 FLIGHT ENGINEER, JOE ACABA. >> EXPEDITION 53 AND 54 FLIGHT ENGINEER, MARK VANDE HEI. >> THAT’S AWESOME. WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU. THANKS FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. SO WE’LL START WITH KOMRADE AND PAOLO, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN UP THERE THE LONGEST, SO JUST HOW HAVE THE-- HOW’S THE MISSION BEEN GOING SO FAR? WHAT ARE SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS? >> I THINK CERTAINLY HIGHS FOR US WERE GETTING TO WORK WITH THE PREVIOUS CREW AND THE SPACE NINJA, PEGGY WHITSON, LEARNING FROM THEM TO BE ABLE TO TAKE OVER AND RUN SPACE STATION WHEN WE HAD OUR NEW CREW SHOW UP FOR EXPEDITION 53. WE GOT TO HAVE A DRAGON COME UP HERE AND BRING A WHOLE BUNCH OF SCIENCE THAT WE GOT TO WORK WITH FOR A WHOLE MONTH. CERTAINLY THE PAST WEEK HAS BEEN REAL EXCITING BECAUSE WE DID TWO EVAs THAT ARE REALLY TURN THE STATION BACK TO GOOD CONFIGURATION WITH A ROBOTIC ARM, AND SOME CAMERA WORK, AND PREPARING STUFF FOR ROBOTIC TASKS IN THE FUTURE. SO WE’VE GOT A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON INSIDE AND GOING ON OUTSIDE, AND SO IT’S BEEN A REALLY EXCITING EXPEDITION SO FAR AND WE STILL ARE ONLY ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH. >> WELL NOT MUCH TO ADD TO KOMRADE HAS ALREADY SAID. I MEAN, WE’RE DOING A LOT OF ACTIVITIES HERE. IT’S ALWAYS CRAZY. LIKE, YOU CAN WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, START WORKING WITH SOMETHING, AND SPIN AROUND, AND WORK WITH SOME SCIENCE, AND THEN SPIN AROUND AGAIN, AND WORK WITH THE ROBOTIC ARM. WE’VE BEEN DOING ALMOST ALL OF IT RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE, WHAT, 200 MORE ACTIVITIES, 250, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I MEAN, AND WE ARE DOING ALL OF THEM. >> FANTASTIC. SO TODAY, I MEAN, I’M SURE THERE’S A LOT OF DIFFERENT TOPICS THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT, BUT REALLY WANTED TO FOCUS ON ASTRONAUT PHOTOGRAPHY TODAY BECAUSE YOU GUYS HAVE SUCH A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE OF THE EARTH AND YOU GET SOME TIME SOMETIMES TO GO AND TAKE PHOTOS OF THE EARTH AND MAYBE JUST KIND OF WATCH THE EARTH GO BY. SO I GUESS SINCE, KOMRADE, YOU’RE HOLDING THE MIC, IF YOU WANT TO SHARE SOME EXPERIENCES FROM JUST LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AND JUST KIND OF WHAT THAT FEELING IS LIKE? WHAT IT’S LIKE TO WATCH THE EARTH GO BY? >> I MEAN, IT’S REALLY HUMBLING BECAUSE IT’S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL THING AND THEY’RE SO-- SO FAR, BEEN SO FEW OF US THAT HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO SEE IT. AND YOU DON’T LOOK AT THE EARTH AND COME-- NOT BE CHANGED. YOU CERTAINLY FEEL A PART OF THE EARTH. YOU REALIZE THAT EVERY EXPERIENCES YOU’VE EVER HAD, EVERY PERSON YOU’VE EVER KNOWN IS DOWN ON THAT LITTLE BLUE MARBLE. AND WHEN YOU SEE THE CURVE, YOUR MIND KNOWS HOW BIG THE EARTH IS AND REALIZE WHEN YOU GO AROUND IT IN 90 MINUTES YOU’RE BACK TO ESSENTIALLY THE SAME SPOT. AND THE FACT THAT WE CAN DO THAT AND SEE THAT YOU JUST FEEL COMPELLED TO SHARE IT. I’LL HAND THE MIC OVER TO SABOT OVER HERE BECAUSE HE’S ONLY BEEN UP HERE ABOUT A MONTH, BUT TO GET HIS IMPRESSIONS ON WHAT IT WENT FROM SEEING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME TO NOW TRANSLATING THAT INTO PHOTOGRAPHY TO TRY AND SHARE THAT WITH OTHERS. >> THE THING THAT IMPRESSED ME THE MOST WHEN I FIRST LOOKED OUT THE CUPOLA TO SEE THE EARTH WAS HOW CLOSE THE RECOGNIZABLE FEATURES OF THE EARTH SEEM TO SPACE. FOR EXAMPLE, SEEING ITALY AND IN THE SAME VIEW SEEING THE BLACKNESS OF SPACE. IT MAKES IT SEEM LIKE EVERYBODY ON THE EARTH IS REALLY, REALLY CLOSE TO SPACE WITHOUT EVER REALIZING IT. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, THERE’S JUST A THIN LAYER OF ATMOSPHERE THAT ALL OF HUMANITY’S LIVING IN AND OUTSIDE OF THAT IS SPACE. SO IT’S IMPRESSIVE TO ME HOW CLOSE WE REALLY ARE ALL TO WHAT WE SEE AS OUTER SPACE. FROM A PHOTOGRAPHY PERSPECTIVE, I THINK THAT’S AN IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVE FOR EVERYBODY TO HAVE, SO MY FAVORITE THING TO DO IS TO TRY TO CAPTURE THOSE PICTURES THAT SHOW BOTH THE SPACE AND PLACES THAT WE RECOGNIZE AND CALL HOME ON THE PLANET. >> ABSOLUTELY. AND KOMRADE, I KNOW YOU’VE SHARED SOME JUST THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE EARTH COMPARED TO SOME OTHER IMAGES, YOU KNOW, BEING ON THE EARTH, TOO. AND THOSE ARE AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE TO SEE. BUT I KNOW WE HAVE SOME ACTUAL QUESTIONS COMING IN FROM SOME OF OUR LISTENERS RIGHT NOW. >> YEAH. THAT’S AMAZING. I CAN’T EVEN IMAGINE WHAT IT’S LIKE TO ACTUALLY SEE THAT VIEW IN PERSON, BUT NEXT BEST THING OF COURSE IS TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT THROUGH PICTURES AND VIDEOS THAT YOU GUYS ARE TAKING. AND THE WHOLE WORLD REALLY APPRECIATES THAT. WE’VE GOT SOME AWESOME QUESTIONS COMING IN. LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN PHOTOGRAPHY IN SPACE AND YOU GUYS ON THE SPACE STATION. SO JACE ON FACEBOOK WANTS TO KNOW, “THERE ARE SO MANY CAMERAS ON THE SPACE STATION, HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHICH CAMERA TO USE? AND CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE EQUIPMENT YOU DO HAVE UP THERE?” >> YES, SO WE DO HAVE-- FOR STILL PHOTOGRAPHY, WE ESSENTIALLY HAVE A NIKON CAMERA. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE SEVERAL D4. EACH ONE OF US GETS HIS OWN, PLUS WE HAVE A COUPLE PLACED STRATEGICALLY. SOME OF THEM ARE DEDICATED FOR SPECIAL PHOTOGRAPHY LIKE MACRO PHOTOGRAPHY. WE NEED TO DO A LOT OF MACRO PHOTOGRAPHY FOR EQUIPMENT HERE. SOME WE JUST DEDICATED TO TAKE-- THERE WAS A MICRO-- A MICRO SHOT, RIGHT? >> YEAH. >> TRY ONE WITH A TELE LENS HERE. SOME, LIKE THIS ONE, WE REALLY USE WHEN WE ARE POINTING AT EARTH AND WE HAVE SOME WINDOWS THAT HAVE A SPECIAL CAPABILITY OF LETTING US TAKE PICTURES WITH THIS LENS. AND THEN, WE HAVE-- WE ALSO HAVE A RED DRAGON CAMERA THAT WE USE FOR CINEMATOGRAPHY. WE HAVE VIDEO CAMERAS THAT ALLOWS US TO TAKE HD PHOTOS. I MEAN, I WOULD SAY THAT FROM A POINT OF VIEW OF CAMERAS, LENSES, SET-UP, WE ARE ALL SET HERE. WE HAVE EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE. IT’S JUST WHAT IS MISSING A LITTLE BIT IS THE TIME BECAUSE IT TAKES TIME TO BE THERE AT THE WINDOW. IT’S NOT THAT YOU JUST GO THERE AND YOU CAN TAKE A PICTURE AND LEAVE. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT REALLY MAKES SENSE YOU NEED TO HAVE TO BE THERE AND STAY THERE AND UNDERSTAND-- BECAUSE IT’S A VERY QUICK CHANGING ENVIRONMENT HERE. YOU HAVE TO THINK THAT WE ARE FLYING AROUND EARTH AT ABOUT 4 MILES PER SECOND AND THINGS CHANGE REALLY DRAMATICALLY AND REALLY QUICKLY. AND NOT ONLY THAT, YOU DON’T ALWAYS PASS OVER THE SAME PLACE WITH THE SAME CONDITIONS, ACTUALLY ALMOST NEVER. SO ALL THE CONDITIONS CHANGE CONTINUOUSLY-- THE SUN, THE CLOUD COVERAGE, THE SEASONS. I MEAN, THE COLORS, THE MOON, MAKES A LOT OF CHANGES DURING THE NIGHT. SO IT’S BEEN A QUITE INTERESTING TIME HERE IN TRYING TO TAKE ALL OF THIS ARMADA OF EQUIPMENT THAT WE HAVE AND TRY TO MAKE IT DO WHAT WE WANT IT TO DO. NOT ALWAYS HAPPENS, BUT SOMEBODY WILL GET REALLY GREAT, GREAT THINGS SOMETIMES. >> YEAH, SOUNDS LIKE THERE’S A PARTICULAR TECHNIQUE TO TAKE THE ABSOLUTE BEST [PICTURES THAT YOU CAN. AND FROM WHAT YOU’RE SAYING, YOU HAVE TO BE THERE FOR QUITE SOME TIME. AND THIS IS JUST SOMETHING THAT I’VE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN IN ASKING, BUT I’M SURE THE CUPOLA IS JUST A HOT PLACE TO BE ON THE SPACE STATION TO GET THOSE PHOTOS. SO HOW DO YOU SHARE YOUR TIME? AND WHO GETS TO-- TO SEE WHO GETS TO GO IN THE CUPOLA? >> WELL, PAOLO’S THE BIGGEST SO HE ALWAYS GETS THE FIRST-- HE GETS THE FIRST GO. THERE’S A LOT OF TIME IN THE DAY, BUT WE’RE REALLY BUSY AND SO IF SOMEBODY HAS AN INTEREST, THEY KNOW SOMETHING’S COMING UP THEY WANT TO SEE, THEY LET US ALL KNOW AND WE RESPECT THAT AND LET THEM HAVE THAT SPACE. BUT SOMETIMES, THINGS MIGHT COME UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, SO IT’S AT TIMES WE’RE ALL IN THERE BECAUSE SOMETHING IS SO COOL AND WE ALL WANT TO SEE IT. AND SOMETIMES, YOU’RE IN THERE BY YOURSELF JUST ENJOYING IT. AND SOMETIMES, YOU DON’T TAKE PICTURES. I’M NOT THE GREATEST PHOTOGRAPHER SO I JUST ENJOY GOING AND LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW. BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN, WE WRESTLE FOR IT AND-- BUT WE MAKE IT WORK. >> NICE. ALL RIGHT, THIS ONE’S FOR JOE TOO FOR YOU, I HAVE TO ASK FROM FACEBOOK, JESSICA SAYS, “MY FIRST GRADERS WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOUR FAVORITE PART ABOUT SPACE IS? JOE WAS MY MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER AND NOW I’M A TEACHER.” THAT’S PRETTY COOL. >> WOW! THAT’S VERY COOL. HELLO, JESSICA. GLAD THAT YOU’RE FOLLOWING US. THERE ARE SO MANY COOL THINGS ABOUT BEING IN SPACE. ONE OF THEM IS, OF COURSE, FLOATING AROUND. THESE GUYS ARE COOL AND THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE FORM ARE REALLY, REALLY COOL. SO I WOULD SAY BEING ABLE TO DO THIS AND JUST KIND OF HANG OUT IN ANY DIRECTION YOU WANT, YOU KIND OF FEEL LIKE A SUPERHERO, SO THAT’S PRETTY COOL. BUT AGAIN, LOOKING BACK AT THE EARTH IS SIMPLY AMAZING. SO JESSICA, I HOPE YOUR FIRST GRADERS GET INSPIRED TO KEEP STUDYING HARD, STUDYING THE STEM FIELDS, AND HOPEFULLY THEY’LL BE DOING MORE THAN WE’RE DOING TODAY ON THE SPACE STATION AND MAYBE THEY’LL BE VISITING OTHER PLANETS. SO THANKS A LOT. >> THANKS, JOE. AND I JUST HAVE TO MENTION, THAT SHE MENTIONED IN THAT COMMENT THAT YOU WERE A FORMER CLASSROOM TEACHER AND YOU’RE UP THERE. FOLLOWING YOU WE’LL HAVE RICKY ARNOLD, WHO IS ALSO A FORMER CLASSROOM TEACHER. AND AS PART OF THAT, WE’RE REALLY TALKING A LOT ABOUT EDUCATION AND HOW IT RELATES TO THE SPACE STATION. SO YOU CAN GO LOOK UP STEM ON STATION AND THERE’S A WEBSITE OUT THERE, AND EDUCATORS CAN FIND A LOT OF COOL RESOURCES THERE. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> ALL RIGHT, I GOT ANOTHER QUESTION ON FACEBOOK. THIS IS FROM JACE, “WERE YOU ABLE TO OPERATE PROFESSIONAL CAMERAS BEFORE BECOMING ASTRONAUTS, OR DID YOU LEARN ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHY DURING TRAINING? >> I NEVER TOUCHED A PROFESSIONAL CAMERA UNTIL I BECAME AN ASTRONAUT. AND THAT’S BEEN ONE OF THE REALLY NEAT OPPORTUNITIES ABOUT BEING AN ASTRONAUT IS THE-- LIKE THE VERY FANCY CAMERAS LIKE THE RED CAMERA THAT PAOLO MENTIONED. IT’S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE ARRAY OF EQUIPMENT AND THE GREAT TRAINERS TO HELP US LEARN HOW TO USE THEM. >> SO SABOT, I MEAN, YOU’VE BEEN UP THERE-- THIS IS YOUR FIRST SPACE FLIGHT AND YOU HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE BEING A FIRST TIME FLYER, BUT ESPECIALLY I WAS WATCHING YOU ON YOUR SPACEWALK AND YOU GOT A COUPLE MOMENTS TO-- DURING THE SPACEWALK LOOK DOWN AT THE EARTH. SO CAN YOU SORT OF DESCRIBE THAT EXPERIENCE? >> IT’S HARD TO TAKE IT ALL IN. IT’S SO MASSIVE. IT’ EVERYWHERE. THE THINGS THAT STUCK OUT IN MY MIND WERE SEEING-- AT NIGHT, SEEING FLASHES OF LIGHTENING THAT WENT ON FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT, IT WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE. IN FACT, I’LL NEVER FORGET WHEN-- ON THE VERY FIRST SPACEWALK WHEN RANDY OPENED THE HATCH THE AIRLOCK JUST LIT UP BECAUSE OF ALL THE REFLECTED LIGHT COMING FROM THE EARTH INTO THE AIRLOCK. AND THE AIRLOCK’S A VERY CONFINED PLACE. IT DOESN’T HAVE-- IT’S WELL LIT, BUT IT’S NOT LIT LIKE THE SUN, AND SO IT CHANGED THE FEELING OF THE AIRLOCK DRAMATICALLY WHEN THAT HATCH OPENED UP AND THEN IT REALLY FELT REAL TO ME. >> THAT’S AWESOME. ALL RIGHT, ANOTHER QUESTION. COLIN ON FACEBOOK WANTS TO KNOW, “IF YOU GUYS TAKE SPACE SELFIES UP THERE?” MAYBE YOU GOT TO TAKE ONE ON YOUR SPACEWALK. >> [ INDISTINCT ]. >> GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD. >> YEAH, I JUST POSTED SOMETHING FROM OUR LAST SPACEWALK ON TUESDAY WITH THE SPACE SELFIE AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU GOT THESE BIG INFLATED GLOVES ON AND YOU’RE TRYING TO TAKE THIS CAMERA. AND IT’S LIKE IF YOU WENT TO YOUR OVEN, AND GRABBED YOUR OVEN MITTS, AND THEN GRABBED YOUR CAMERA AND TRIED TO TAKE THE SELFIE. THAT’S WHAT IT’S KIND OF LIKE IN SPACE TRYING TO DO THAT, AND LINE IT UP, AND FEEL FOR THE BUTTON, AND GET THE SHOT. SO YOU END UP TRYING TO SQUEEZE IT A FEW TIMES. HOPEFULLY YOU SEE MAYBE THE SHUTTER ACTUALLY TOOK THE PICTURE. AND THEN YOU COME BACK INSIDE LATER ON AND GO, “HEY, DID I GET ANYTHING?” >> AMAZING. HEY, SO PAOLO, WE WERE KIND OF LOOKING AT SOME OF YOUR PHOTOS ON TWITTER, JUST THE ONES THAT YOU’RE SHARING. I SEE A LOT OF AMAZING PICTURES OF ITALY, BUT ONE THAT REALLY STUCK OUT IN MY MIND WAS A PICTURE OF MADAGASCAR AND THE LOGGING GOING ON THERE. JUST FROM THE PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU SEE OF THE EARTH, WHAT SORTS OF IDEAS OF HUMAN INFLUENCE DO YOU SEE FROM 250 MILES ABOVE THE EARTH? >> WELL, WHEN YOU COME UP HERE AND YOU LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW, AND MOST OF THE TIME YOU SEE OCEAN AND CLOUDS, AND THEN SOMETIMES YOU EVEN HAVE DIFFICULTIES ON SEEING THE ACTUAL GROUND, THE CONTINENTS. AND THEN LITTLE BY LITTLE YOU START ACQUIRING THIS ACUITY, YOU LITERALLY START SEEING DETAILS. AND AT THE BEGINNING, THE HUMAN PRESENCE IS NOT SO EVIDENT, AND THEN IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE AND MORE EVIDENT, UP TO THE POINT THAT WHEN YOU GO THERE AND IT’S NIGHT YOU ESSENTIALLY SEE THE PLANET LIT UP, ALL THE CONTINENT’S LIT UP LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE. AND IN SOME OF THE PLACES IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES ARE THE PRESENCE OF THE HUMAN BEINGS. IT’S INCREDIBLE. AND THEN, YOU START FOCUSING ON OTHER THINGS, LIKE YOU SEE RIVERS, YOU SEE HOW THERE’S A SHAPE. YOU SEE HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED, HOW AS HUMAN BEINGS HAVE TRYING TO MODEL NATURE ACCORDING TO OUR NEEDS AND NOT OURSELF ACCORDING TO THE NEEDS OF NATURE. AND THIS CHANGE BECOMES REALLY APPARENT. THERE IN THAT PICTURE THAT YOU’RE REFERRING TO, YOU SEE ESSENTIALLY ALL THE RED DIRT THAT IS WASHING OVER ON THE OCEAN. NOT ANYMORE KEPT BY THE FOREST BY THE PLANTS-- BY THE PLANTS THERE IN MADAGASCAR. AND THIS IS SO EVIDENT IT’S REALLY CLEAR FROM UP HERE THAT WE ARE A MAJOR FORCE INTO THIS PLANET AND WE ARE CHANGING NATURE. IS THAT GOOD, IS THAT BAD? I’M NOT SURE ABOUT IT. FOR SURE WE PROBABLY NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT WE ARE DOING IF WE WANT TO KEEP THE ENVIRONMENT AS IT IS TODAY OR YESTERDAY. >> WOW, THAT’S REALLY INTERESTING. SIMILAR TO THAT, NATALIE IS ASKING, “IF YOU’VE OBSERVED A CHANGE IN COLOR OF THE SUNRISES AND SUNSETS DUE TO THE WILDFIRES ACROSS NORTH AMERICA?” OR MAYBE IF YOU’VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE ANYTHING, ANY OF THE WILDFIRES?” >> WE’VE SEEN THE WILDFIRES WHEN WE WERE OVER IN OREGON AND WASHINGTON LAST MONTH. UNFORTUNATELY, THE WAY OUR DAY CYCLE WORKS, WE’RE NOT GOING OVER CALIFORNIA WHERE A TIME WHERE WE’RE TYPICALLY LOOKING OUTSIDE DURING DAYLIGHT. SO NONE OF US HAVE REALLY SEEN THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES THAT MUCH YET. YOU CAN SEE CERTAINLY THE SMOKE OBSCURES THE LOOK DOWN, BUT HAVEN’T SEEN ANY CHANGES TO THE OVERALL ATMOSPHERE OR THE COLOR OF THE SUN BECAUSE IT’S JUST NOT THAT MANY-- THAT MUCH PARTICULATE WHEN YOU’RE LOOKING AT IT AT A GLOBAL SCALE. >> SO KOMRADE, KIND OF SIMILAR QUESTION. RECENTLY, AGAIN, WE WERE LOOKING AT A LOT OF THE PHOTOS THAT YOU’RE SHARING ON SOCIAL MEDIA, BUT RECENTLY THERE’VE BEEN QUITE A FEW HURRICANES THAT HAVE HIT THE UNITED STATES, PUERTO RICO, A LOT OF THE CARIBBEAN ISLANDS AND YOU SHARED YOUR PERSPECTIVE OF THAT VIEW. CAN YOU-- I MEAN, THE PICTURES CAN TELL ONE STORY, BUT JUST FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, WHAT WAS IT LIKE SEEING IT FROM THE SPACE STATION, THE HURRICANES? >> CERTAINLY, THE FORMATION OF WEATHER CAN BE A REAL BEAUTIFUL THING AND HURRICANES HAVE THEIR OWN SHAPE AND DO AMAZING THINGS WITH THE CLOUDS. BUT IT’S WHEN YOU REALIZE THE DESTRUCTIVE POWER UNDERNEATH IT IT CEASES BEING AS BEAUTIFUL. AND CERTAINLY, THE FIRST ONE FOR US WAS HURRICANE HARVEY THAT WENT RIGHT OVER OUR FAMILIES, AND OUR HOMES, AND OUR FRIENDS, AND MISSION CONTROL DOWN THERE IN HOUSTON. AND SO, THAT WAS-- YOU SAY, “TOO CLOSE TO HOME.” WELL, THAT WAS AT HOME SO THAT WAS TOO CLOSE TO HOME FOR US. SO THEN THE PARADE OF HURRICANES AFTER THAT WAS JUST DISHEARTENING BECAUSE THERE WERE JUST SO MANY, AND SO MANY PEOPLE AFFECTED, AND SO MUCH DEVASTATION THAT IT-- WE WERE TAKING PICTURES TO HOPEFULLY HELP THE RESEARCHERS THAT ARE USING THOSE TO FIGURE OUT HOW HURRICANES FORM, HOW THEY CONTINUE TO MANIFEST THEMSELVES, WHAT WE CAN DO TO PROTECT OURSELVES. AND THEN, IT WAS TAKING PICTURES AFTERWARDS, HIGH RESOLUTION PHOTOGRAPHY, MAPPING THE AREAS TO SHOW WHERE THERE WAS FLOODING OR DESTRUCTION THAT WE DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT AT THAT POINT BECAUSE THERE STILL WASN’T COMMUNICATION OR CAMERA CREWS WERE ABLE TO GO OUT AND PICTURE STUFF.              PICKING UP AT 24:00  SO IT WAS AN UNFORTUNATE PROJECT THAT WE ENDED UP DOING, BUT HOPEFULLY THE WORK WE DID UP HERE TRANSLATES INTO SOME SCIENCE, AND WE’RE ABLE TO TRANSLATE IT INTO ACTUAL PRACTICAL STUFF THAT’LL HELP PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE. >> I WOULD THINK IT DID. IT’S SUCH A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE. >> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. SEEING THE HURRICANES AND THE FLOODING AND ALL OF THAT FROM SPACE IS JUST REALLY AN OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU JUST CAN’T SEE WHEN YOU ARE RIGHT HERE NEXT TO IT. SO IT’S VERY INTERESTING. AND SIMILAR TO THAT, NATALIE WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU COULD TALK TO US ABOUT THE WORF RACK, WHAT TYPES OF PHOTOS DO YOU TAKE FROM THERE, AND HOW DO YOU USE PHOTOGRAPHY FOR SCIENCE. >> YEAH, SO WE HAVE VARIOUS PROJECTS THAT WE’LL DO, AND ACTUALLY THE WORF RACK IS RIGHT HERE BENEATH US. IT’S ONE OF THE BEST WINDOWS THAT WE HAVE ON THE SPACE STATION. IT’S VERY WELL PROTECTED, SO VERY PRISTINE, AND WE CAN GET SOME REALLY COOL PHOTOS. UNFORTUNATELY FOR US, IT’S USUALLY COVERED UP, SO WE DON’T GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE IT TOO OFTEN. BUT THERE’S A LOT OF SCIENCE THAT GOES ON. I KNOW WHEN I WAS HERE LAST TIME, WE HAD THE EARTHCAM PROJECT GOING ON WHERE MIDDLE SCHOOL CHILDREN WERE TAKING PHOTOS AND LEARNING ABOUT THOSE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD. WE WERE ALSO USING IT FOR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES TO MAP DIFFERENT THINGS, SO IT’S A MULTIPURPOSE WINDOW, AND IT IS JUST A VERY UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU CAN GET FROM HERE. AND THEN YOU CAN PUT THE CAMERAS AT DIFFERENT ANGLES, YOU CAN DO THE DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE YEAR, DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE DAY. SO IT HAS A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY. IT’S PRETTY COOL. >> [ INDISTINCT ] >> THERE’S ALSO-- I KNOW WE’VE DONE-- THERE’S AN EXPERIMENT THAT’S BEEN GOING ON WITH ANALYZING THE SPECTRUM OF METEORS THAT ARE FALLING TOWARDS THE EARTH AND USING DIFFRACTION GRATINGS WITH THE LENS. SO THERE’S SOME REALLY INTERESTING SCIENCE THAT CAN COME OUT OF PHOTOGRAPHY. >> SO SABOT AND JOE, BOTH OF YOU HAVE BEEN EDUCATORS IN THE PAST, AND-- JOE JUST BEING A MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER, AND SABOT WITH-- AT WEST POINT. BUT IS THERE SORT OF AN EDUCATION PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU CAN DO FROM SHARING YOUR VIEW OF THE EARTH? OR MAYBE SOME OTHER EXPERIMENTS YOU’RE DOING ONBOARD THE STATION THAT YOU CAN USE TO SHARE WITH OTHERS. >> WELL, I THINK AS AN EDUCATOR, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS THAT YOU CAN HAVE IS SHARING EXPERIENCES AND REAL LIFE EXPERIENCES. SO AS MUCH AS WE CAN DO THAT TO HELP TEACHERS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND PROVIDE THEM MORE TOOLS TO DO THEIR JOB. SINCE WE’VE BEEN HERE, IT’S BEEN NON-STOP. IT’S KIND OF LIKE THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR, WHERE YOU’RE KIND OF GETTING ON YOUR FEET, GETTING THE BALL ROLLING. BUT THEN WE HAD DRAGON, AND THEN WE HAD TWO SPACEWALKS ALREADY, SO TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, THAT’S THE KIND OF EXPERIENCE THAT WE WANT TO SHARE. AND HOPEFULLY BY DOING THAT AND BY RECORDING THAT, WHETHER IT’S WITH PHOTOS, VIDEO-- WE CAN SHARE THAT EXPERIENCES WITH TEACHERS WHO CAN THEN SHARE THAT WITH THEIR STUDENTS. >> THAT’S AWESOME. IT’S SO INTERESTING TO SO MANY OF US DOWN HERE, SO WE APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO HEAR ABOUT THE AWESOME WORK YOU GUYS ARE DOING. I HAVE TO MENTION, KOMRADE, I’M GETTING A LOT OF COMMENTS ON FACEBOOK ABOUT YOUR SHIRT-- PEOPLE REALLY LOVE IT, SO I HAD TO TELL YOU THAT. JOSEPH WANTS TO KNOW, “WHAT’S THE MOST AMAZING PHOTO YOU TOOK?” SO DOES ANYBODY HAVE A FAVORITE PICTURE YET SO FAR? >> IT’S-- IT’S RELATIVELY EASY UP HERE TO DO TIME LAPSES, WHICH MEANS A LOT OF PHOTOS. AND THEY CAN GO GOOD OR TOTALLY BAD. I MEAN, I’VE DONE THOUSAND PICTURE COMPLETELY WASTED. THANK GOD IT’S NOT FILM ANYMORE AND ELECTRONS DON’T COST TOO MUCH. BUT I GOT A COUPLE OF TIME LAPSES PRETTY GOOD. THE ONE THAT I THINK WAS PROBABLY THE BEST IS ONE OF THE AURORA IN THE NORTH. SO IT WAS AURORA BOREALIS. AND I CAN-- I DON’T KNOW THAT NIGHT WHAT HAPPENED, BUT THE SPACE OF THE AURORA, THE COLORS TOWARD THE GROUND, AND THE SHADOWS WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN UNDER US. AND THIS WAS, TO ME, INCREDIBLE, ALL THAT SEQUENCE OF PICTURES. >> AND I THINK PAOLO MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT THE EARTH IS EVER CHANGING. FOR ME, TO PICK OUT ONE AFTER JUST THE FEW MONTHS WE’VE BEEN HERE IS IMPOSSIBLE. IT’S EVERY DAY THERE’S ONE OR TWO THAT I GO, “WOW, THAT WAS JUST SO AMAZING. I’M SO FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SEEN THAT.” AND THAT’S A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT WE’RE TRYING TO POST AND SHARE WITH YOU GUYS, BECAUSE EVERY DAY IS FULL OF AMAZING PICTURES. AND MY FOLDER OF AMAZING PICTURES FROM SPACE JUST KEEPS GROWING DAILY. >> I’D SAY MY FAVORITE PHOTO SO FAR IS ONE OF, FRANKLY, ITALY AND THE ALPS THAT WE HAPPENED-- I THINK KOMRADE DREW MY ATTENTION TO IT, GOT ME TO LOOK DOWN DURING THE SPACEWALK, AND I SNAPPED A COUPLE PICTURES. THE CAMERA DID A LOT OF GREAT WORK FOR ME, BECAUSE ALL I COULD REALLY DO IN THAT SITUATION WAS PRESS THE BUTTON. AND THE PICTURES TURNED OUT GREAT-- REALLY BRIGHTLY LIT JAPANESE MODULE OF THE SPACE STATION IN THE FOREGROUND, AND ITALY AND THE ALPS IN THE BACKGROUND. >> [ INDISTINCT ]. >> YEAH, AND IF I COULD JUST ADD, PROBABLY ONE OF MY FAVORITES WAS TAKEN JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO. AND KOMRADE AND I HAD A CONFERENCE THAT WAS SCHEDULED WITH SOME OF OUR FLIGHT DIRECTORS LOOKING AT THE UPCOMING SPACEWALK, AND ASKED OF ME, “WHERE ARE WE RIGHT NOW?” HE’S LIKE, “I THINK THAT’S SOUTH AMERICA.” AND I SAID, “WELL, IS PUERTO RICO GOING TO BE COMING UP?” AND HE’S LIKE, “WOW, THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE.” SO WE GRABBED CAMERAS RIGHT AWAY, AND IT WAS JUST A BEAUTIFUL DAY. I KNOW PEOPLE ARE STILL RECOVERING OVER IN PUERTO RICO, SO HOPEFULLY I CAN GET THESE PICTURES OUT AND THEY CAN SEE HOW BEAUTIFUL THEIR ISLAND LOOKS FROM UP HERE. BUT IT WAS PRETTY COOL TO TAKE THAT TODAY. >> WOW, GOOD TIMING. THAT IS AWESOME. WE CAN’T WAIT TO SEE THOSE PICTURES, AND I KNOW THE PEOPLE IN PUERTO RICO WILL BE REALLY, REALLY ANXIOUS TO SEE THAT. ALL RIGHT, SO WE’VE GOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE EXPOSURE TIMES ON YOUR CAMERAS. CAN YOU GUYS TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT? >> TYPICALLY FOR DAYTIME EARTH OBS, WE’RE SHOOTING, A LOT OF TIMES, SHUTTER PRIORITY AND WE’RE SHOOTING FOR ONE OVER THE FOCAL LENGTH. SO IF YOU’VE GOT A 400MM LENS LIKE THIS BIG MONSTER, YOU’RE SHOOTING 1/400 AND LETTING THE CAMERA TAKE CARE OF THE APERTURE. NIGHTTIME IS CERTAINLY DIFFERENT. DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT WE’VE GOT MOON OR WE DON’T. AT THAT POINT, WE’RE SETTING UP THE CAMERAS ON ARMS SO THAT WE’RE NOT JIGGLING THEM, LIKE A TRIPOD ON THE GROUND. AND WE’RE SHOOTING ANYWHERE FROM A SECOND, TO TWO SECOND, UP TO EVEN-- PAOLO WAS SHOOTING THIS WEEK A TENTH OF A SECOND BECAUSE IT WAS SO BRIGHT WITH THE MOON OVER THE GROUND. SO YOU KIND OF ADJUST FOR THE CONDITIONS TO BE ABLE TO GET THE SHOTS ON THE TIME OF DAY. >> GREAT, THANKS. ALL RIGHT, JESSICA IS SAYING, “HI FROM CHICAGO. CAN YOU RECALL A TIME WHEN YOU SAW SOMETHING FROM UP THERE THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE CAPTURED ON CAMERA, OR SOMETHING THAT JUST DOESN’T DO JUSTICE ON CAMERA THAT YOU WISH TO SHARE?” >> IT’S REALLY INTERESTING, BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU’RE GOING TO GET. AND ACTUALLY, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU’RE GOING TO SEE, TO START WITH. MORE OR LESS YOU CAN PREDICT, BUT THE CONDITION CHANGES SO DRASTICALLY THAT YOU CAN WAIT FOR THE WHOLE DAY FOR A PASS OVER ITALY, FOR EXAMPLE, JUST TO DISCOVER THAT IT’S COMPLETELY COVERED BY CLOUDS. YOU DON’T EVEN SEE WHERE IT IS. OR THE OPPOSITE. OR YOU’RE DOING SOMETHING, YOU’RE THERE DOING EXERCISE. WE HAVE THE CUPOLA RIGHT THERE WHERE WE’RE DOING EXERCISE. YOU’RE THERE DOING A SET OF SOMETHING AND SUDDENLY, AN ISLAND APPEARS OUT OF THE BLUE AND IS INCREDIBLE COLORS. [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST LOST THE QUESTION. WHAT WAS THE QUESTION? >> [ INDISTINCT ]. >> AH, YES. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT CANNOT BE-- I MEAN, THE CAMERA CANNOT TRANSLATE, AND-- BECAUSE IT’S VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE THE LIGHT. FOR EXAMPLE, I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO TAKE PICTURES WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN, BECAUSE THERE IS THIS HUGE BRIGHT SUN THERE AND YOU’RE TRYING TO CAPTURE SOMETHING ELSE AND YOU CANNOT DO IT. SO IN SPACE, THERE ARE HUGE CONTRASTS BETWEEN THE FULL DAY AND THE FULL NIGHT. THERE IS NOTHING IN THE MIDDLE THERE, AND IT’S VERY DIFFICULT TO TRANSITION. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN WE DO A NIGHTTIME TIME LAPSES AND WE SET UP THE CAMERA FOR NIGHT, AS SOON AS WE GET THE SUN, JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SUN OUT IT’S TOTALLY WASHED OUT. AND I WOULD LOVE, FOR EXAMPLE, TO SHOW THIS TRANSITION AS WE SEE IT WITH THE EYE THAT ADJUSTS CONTINUOUSLY. THIS TRANSITION FROM NIGHT TO DAY, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I STILL HAVEN’T FIGURED OUT A WAY TO DO IT. MAYBE WE’LL THINK ABOUT IT AND WE’LL WORK ON IT. >> WELL, KOMRADE, THAT KIND OF MAKES ME THINK OF-- I KNOW VERY SOON-- I THINK ON OCTOBER 23rd YOU WANT TO DO A SORT OF AROUND THE WORLD IN 90 MINUTES AND THEN KIND OF SHARE YOUR PERSPECTIVE OF A GREAT PASS OVER A LOT OF POPULATED CITIES AND VARIOUS FEATURES OF THE EARTH. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT YOUR PLANS ARE FOR THAT, WHAT YOU’RE GOING TO DO OVER THOSE 90 MINUTES? >> WELL, IT’S NOT JUST ME. IT’S GOING TO END UP BEING A CREW PROJECT. AND THE THOUGHT WAS TO SHOW EVERYBODY ON THE GROUND WHAT IT’S LIKE, AND THE FEATURES THAT CAPTURE OUR ATTENTION DURING EACH MINUTE OF THOSE 90 MINUTES IN ONE REVOLUTION OF THE EARTH, WHETHER IT’S DAY OR NIGHT. AND IDEALLY PEOPLE ARE ENGAGED AND THEY CAN THEN ADD TO THE PROJECT AND THE CONVERSATION-- WHAT WAS GOING ON ON THE GROUND AT THAT MOMENT THEMSELVES-- AND KIND OF CREATE THIS MOMENT IN TIME WHERE WE CIRCLE THE GLOBE, AND WHAT WAS THE WORLD DOING AT THAT MOMENT? AND SO WE’LL BE TRYING TO TAKE THOSE PICTURES. I THINK WE HAVEN’T QUITE SETTLED ON A DATE YET, BUT YES, IT’LL BE AFTER WE FINISH OUR LAST EVAs, AND SOMETHING THAT WE HOPE IS A GLOBAL PROJECT THAT’LL INCLUDE MOST OF THE WORLD’S POPULATION THAT WE CAN GET IN A SINGLE PASS, AND REALLY SHOW OFF, SHOWCASE ONE REVOLUTION OF OUR PLANET. >> CAN’T WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOU HAVE PLANNED FOR THAT. WELL, GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME TO COME ON THE PODCAST TODAY AND SHARE YOUR PERSPECTIVE OF EARTH. IT’S JUST SO UNIQUE-- LITERALLY NO ONE ELSE ON THIS PLANET HAS THAT PERSPECTIVE. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME TO DO THAT. AND I KNOW THIS IS THE END OF THE DAY FOR YOU, TOO, SO AGAIN, APPRECIATE ALL FOUR OF YOU PARTICIPATING IN THIS. SO JUST WANT TO WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK ON THE REST OF YOUR MISSION, AND GODSPEED. CAN’T WAIT TIL YOU GUYS GET HOME. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GARY. WE’LL LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT TIME WE GET TO TALK TO YOU, AND READY-- BREAK. >> STATION, THIS IS HOUSTON ACR. THAT CONCLUDES THE EVENT. >> THANK YOU TO ALL THE PARTICIPANTS FROM JSC PAO. STATION, WE ARE NOW RESUMING OPERATIONAL AUDIO COMMUNICATION. >> AW, FANTASTIC. HOW ‘BOUT THAT, MEGAN? >> THAT WAS AMAZING! >> FOUR ASTRONAUTS. WE GOT TO SEE THEIR PERSPECTIVE OF THE PLANET. AND I KNOW WE WERE THROWN SOME IMAGES-- THOSE WERE ACTUAL IMAGES THAT THEY TOOK WHILE THEY WERE ACTUALLY-- SOME OF THE STILL PHOTOGRAPHY THAT THE CAMERA THEY ACTUALLY SHOWED WHILE THEY WERE UP THERE, BUT THEN SOME OF THOSE TIME LAPSES THAT PAOLO WAS TALKING ABOUT, TOO. ABSOLUTELY JUST SUCH A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE. >> YEAH, IT’S SO COOL TO TALK TO THEM AND TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE. AND OF COURSE, YOU CAN SEE ALL THOSE PICTURES ON THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA SITES. AND JUST AMAZING PICTURES THEY’VE TAKEN. >> YEAH, LET’S GO THROUGH THEM. SO WHO CAN WE FOLLOW ON THE STATION? >> ALL RIGHT, SO ALL FOUR OF THOSE GUYS WE JUST TALKED TO ARE ALL ON TWITTER, SO YOU CAN FOLLOW THEM ALL ON TWITTER. KOMRADE IS @ASTROKOMRADE. JOE IS @ASTROACABA. SABOT IS @ASTRO_SABOT. PAOLO IS @ASTRO_PAOLO. AND YOU CAN FOLLOW ALL THE ASTRONAUTS AT @NASA_ASTRONAUTS. AND ALSO, KOMRADE AND PAOLO ARE ALSO ON INSTAGRAM. SO IF YOU LIKE INSTAGRAM, YOU CAN LOOK THEM UP ON INSTAGRAM AND SEE ALL THEIR PICTURES. >> THAT’S RIGHT, YEAH. AND WE TRY TO KIND OF CONSOLIDATE THAT INTO THAT ASTRONAUTS ACCOUNT, TOO, SO YOU CAN JUST SEE EVERYONE’S PICTURES. AND THEY ARE SOME AMAZING PHOTOS. AGAIN, THESE PHOTOS THAT WE’RE SHARING WITH YOU, A LOT OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY SHARED ON THEIR TWITTER ACCOUNT, SO YOU CAN FOLLOW ALONG ON THAT JOURNEY. AND I KNOW THAT EACH OF THEM HAVE A COUPLE MONTHS LEFT, SO THERE’S PLENTY OF IMAGES TO SEE OVER THESE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS. IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT ASTRONAUT PHOTOGRAPHY OR ANYTHING NASA RELATED, JUST GO ON YOUR FAVORITE SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORK AND USE THE HASHTAG #ASKNASA. IF YOU WANT TO ASK US SPECIFICALLY A QUESTION ON “HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST” JUST MENTION US IN THAT #ASKNASA QUESTION. #HWHAP I THINK IS THE ONE WE LIKE TO USE FOR HWHAP JUST SO YOU CAN LIMIT ALL THOSE CHARACTERS, ESPECIALLY FOR TWITTER. BUT IF YOU’RE NOT FOLLOWING “HOUSTON,WE HAVE A PODCAST” ALREADY, SHAMELESS PLUG. I’D SAY GO AND SUBSCRIBE ON WHATEVER PODCAST AVENUE YOU LISTEN TO. I KNOW WE’RE ON iTUNES, SOUNDCLOUD, AND NASA.GOV. WE JUST RECENTLY GOT ON GOOGLE PLAY, SO WHATEVER MEDIUM YOU LIKE TO LISTEN TO YOUR PODCASTS AT. SO I THINK THAT’LL DO IT FOR US HERE. AGAIN, IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, USE THE HASHTAG #NASA, AND BE SURE TO SUBSCRIBE TO “HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST.” AND WE’LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME, HOPEFULLY THE NEXT TIME WE’RE ON CAMERA TALKING TO SPACE. >> YEAH. >> I HOPE SO. SO SUBSCRIBE TO “HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST.” WE’LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME. [ MUSIC ] [ INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ] >> WELCOME TO SPACE. >> HEY, THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND. SO I THINK WE PLUGGED MOST OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT, ALL THE ASTRONAUT ACCOUNTS THAT YOU CAN FOLLOW, AND NASA ASTRONAUTS, AND WHERE YOU CAN SUBSCRIBE TO “HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST,” WHICH, IF YOU’RE LISTENING TO THIS RIGHT NOW, CONGRATULATIONS-- YOU DID A GOOD JOB. BUT THIS PODCAST WAS RECORDED ON OCTOBER 13, 2017. THANKS TO ALEX PERRYMAN, JOHN STOLL, TOMMY [ INDISTINCT ], PAULA VARGAS, CHARLES CLENDANIEL, GREG WISEMAN, BILL STAFFORD, JOSH VALCARCEL, ROB NAVIAS, AND OF COURSE MEGAN SUMNER. THANKS AGAIN TO KOMRADE, SABOT, JOE ACABA, AND PAOLO NESPOLI FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. WE’LL BE BACK NEXT WEEK.",

        description: ">> HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST. WELCOME TO THE OFFICIAL PODCAST OF THE NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, EPISODE 16: SPACESUITS. I’M GARY JORDAN AND I’LL BE YOUR HOST TODAY. SO IF YOU’RE NEW TO THE SHOW, THIS IS WHERE WE BRING IN NASA EXPERTS-- SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, ASTRONAUTS-- ALL TO TELL YOU THE COOLEST PARTS ABOUT WHAT’S GOING ON HERE AT NASA. SO ALLYOOP ON TWITTER IS ASKING IF WE CAN DO AN EPISODE ON SPACESUITS. WELL, THANKS FOR YOUR SUGGESTION, ALLYOOP. LET’S DO IT! TODAY WE’RE TALKING SPACESUITS WITH LES PADILLA. HE’S THE EMU HARDWARE MANAGER AT THE NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER IN HOUSTON, TEXAS, AND THAT JUST MEANS HE MANAGES THE HARDWARE ON THOSE CLASSIC WHITE SPACESUITS YOU SEE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT ASTRONAUTS. WE HAD A GREAT DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW THOSE SPACESUITS WORK, WHAT THEY’RE MADE OF, HOW THEY’VE EVOLVED OVER TIME, AND WHAT THEY’LL LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE. SO WITH NO FURTHER DELAY, LET’S GO LIGHT SPEED AND JUMP RIGHT AHEAD TO OUR TALK WITH MR. LES PADILLA. ENJOY.  [ MUSIC ] >> T MINUS FIVE SECONDS AND COUNTING-- MARK. [ INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ] >> HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST. [ MUSIC ] >> I LIKE TO EXPLAIN TO OTHERS, I FEEL LIKE A KID IN A CANDY STORE WHEN THEY ASK ABOUT IT. >> YEAH. >> IT’S AWESOME TO BOTH SEE THE PAST WHERE IT CAME FROM AND THE FUTURE DESIGNS WHERE WE’RE MAYBE HEADED TOWARDS. >> THAT’S RIGHT, AND THAT’S WHAT WE’RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY, ALL OF THOSE THINGS. >> ALL RIGHT. >> SO I HOPE YOU-- I SEE YOU HAVE A LARGE BINDER OF NOTES. IT’S ACTUALLY ONE PAGE. BUT YEAH, SO WE’RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT ALL TODAY. SO FIRST OF ALL, SPACESUITS. LET’S START FROM LIKE THE OVERARCHING, LIKE WHAT IS A SPACESUIT, WHY DO YOU NEED A SPACESUIT? I THINK THE CLOSEST THING THAT I’VE BEEN DESCRIBED IS LIKE THINK OF IT LIKE A SPACESHIP THAT’S SHAPED LIKE A HUMAN BODY. IS THAT KIND OF RIGHT? >> THAT’S A FANTASTIC DESCRIPTION RIGHT THERE. >> COOL. >> A LOT BETTER AND A LOT SHORTER THAN I COULD’VE SAID IT. >> OKAY SO WHAT ARE THEY, HOW, LIKE WHY A SPACESUIT? WHY DO WE NEED THAT? WHY CAN’T WE JUST USE THE FANCY SPACECRAFT WITH LIKE ARMS ON IT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? >> YEAH, SO AT SOME POINT, PEOPLE BEFORE US DECIDED, “WE WANT TO GO TO SPACE.” AND AFTER THAT THEY DECIDED GOING TO SPACE WASN’T ENOUGH. WE WANT TO GO EXTRAVEHICULAR, OUTSIDE THE SPACESHIP-- WHATEVER SPACESHIP IT IS, FROM SHUTTLE TO STATION, TO BEFORE THOSE AND THE MERCURY MISSIONS ALL THE WAY IN THE EARLY DAYS. AND THE SPACESUIT, THE PURPOSE OF IT IS TO BE SORT OF AS YOU SAID, A MINIATURE AIRCRAFT, BUT ALLOW US MOBILITY, FLEXIBILITY, MANEUVERABILITY, SO THAT A CREW MEMBER COULD MOVE AROUND WHEN THEY’RE DOING WORK OR JUST EXPERIENCING THE ENVIRONMENT OUT THERE. LIKE IN THE EARLY DAYS IN GEMINI WHEN THEY WENT OUT THE DOOR. >> THAT’S RIGHT, ED WHITE. >> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY, YOU GOT IT. JUST EXPERIENCING THE ENVIRONMENT, DID NOT WANT TO COME BACK IN. >> YEAH. >> OR LATER DAYS, EVEN WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW WITH THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, WHERE THERE ARE MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES AND THERE IS-- WE’VE ALREADY COMPLETED THE ASSEMBLY, SO IT’S MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES IS WHERE WE’RE AT. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT THERE AND DO MORE THAN JUST FLY AROUND AND ENJOY THE SCENERY. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TURN BOLTS. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PULL OUT LARGE BATTERIES AND PUT THEM BACK IN. AND SO THEY NEED SOMETHING THAT OFFERS DEXTERITY AND YET PROTECTION FROM THE VERY HARSH SPACE ENVIRONMENT. >> YOU KNOW, WE JUST SAW THAT, BECAUSE WE JUST DID THE SPACEWALK THE OTHER DAY, RIGHT. THAT WAS THE SECOND OF THREE PLANNED ONES, AND THAT WAS WHEN THEY WERE PUTTING ON SOME OF THE SHIELDS AND EVERYTHING. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> AND THEY DID SOME ROBOTIC WORK, RIGHT, WITH THE STATION’S ROBOTIC ARM. THEY TOOK THE PRESSURIZED MATING ADAPTOR, MOVED IT TO A NEW PLACE, BUT THEY NEEDED HUMAN HANDS TO ACTUALLY CONNECT THE CABLES AND ACTUALLY PUT ON THE SHIELDS. SO IT MAKES SENSE, RIGHT-- YOU NEED THE SUITS BECAUSE THERE’S SOME THINGS THAT ROBOTS JUST CAN’T DO, I GUESS, RIGHT? >> YEAH, NOT YET, NOT WHERE WE ARE TODAY. YOU CAN’T GO TO SPACE WITHOUT EVA. >> YEAH, THAT’S TRUE. OKAY, SO LIKE GOING BACK TO ED WHITE AND GEMINI, THAT WAS-- THE FIRST ONE WAS-- OH, NO, I HAD-- I JUST HAD IT. I WANT TO SAY JUNE 1965? ‘65, THERE IT IS. ALL RIGHT, YEAH. HE CAME OUT AND THEY ACTUALLY USED THE AIR GUN TO MOVE AROUND. AND SUPER FAMOUS VIDEO OF WATCHING HIM JUST LIKE DRIFT OUT, AND HE’S GOT THE UMBILICAL, AND HE’S GOT THE AIR. SO I’VE GOT TO ASK-- WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THAT AIR GUN THINGY? AND THEN WHY DO WE NOT SEE ANYONE USE THOSE ANYMORE? >> YEAH, GREAT QUESTION, YEAH. AND SO THERE’S PROBABLY PEOPLE WISER AND MORE EXPERIENCED THAT HAVE EXTRA DETAILS ON THAT, BUT AT A HIGH, GENERAL LEVEL IT’S JUST DIRECTIONAL CONTROL. SO YOU’RE OUT THERE IN SPACE. WE CALL IT-- WE SAY NO GRAVITY. THERE IS SOME GRAVITY, BUT IT’S MICROGRAVITY, VERY LOW, AND FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES YOU’RE FREEFALLING TOWARDS THE EARTH. AND SO UNLESS YOU’RE HOLDING ONTO A HANDRAIL OR THE VEHICLE ITSELF, YOU WILL CONTINUE TO FLOAT, AND THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL TO THE SURFACE OF EARTH WILL BEGIN TO BRING YOU DOWN. SO AS SOON AS YOU GO OUT THAT DOOR, YOU’VE GOT TO HAVE A WAY-- IT COULD BE A TETHER OR A ROPE TO PULL YOU BACK IN, BUT A WAY TO MANEUVER AROUND THE AREA YOU WANT TO GO. AND SO THE AIR GUN PROVIDES A SMALL PROPULSION CAPABILITY TO NAVIGATE. >> OKAY, MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. SO, OKAY, THEY’RE GOING OUT AND USING THE AIR GUN, BUT NOW I GUESS THEY HAVE-- IT TOOK THEM A WHILE, RIGHT, DURING THE GEMINI? THAT WAS KIND OF A LOT OF THE POINT OF THE GEMINI PROGRAM, WAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO STUFF LIKE THIS, HOW TO DO SPACE RENDEZVOUS, AND HOW TO DO SPACEWALKS. IT TOOK THEM A WHILE, RIGHT? SO THAT WAS GEMINI 4 WAS WHEN ED WHITE CAME OUT. AND THEN IT WASN’T UNTIL GEMINI 12, BUZZ ALDRIN HAD PUT IN SOME PROCEDURES FOR NEUTRAL BUOYANCY LABORATORY TRAINING, WHERE THEY ACTUALLY TRAIN IN THE WATER TO SEE HOW THEY CAN MOVE AROUND, BECAUSE EVERYONE WAS GETTING SORT OF TIRED WHEN THEY WERE GOING OUT BECAUSE THEY DIDN’T HAVE THE PROCEDURES YET. AND THEY FINALLY NAILED IT FOR GEMINI 12, RIGHT? >> YES. SPACEWALKS ARE TOUGH, TOUGH JOBS. >> YEAH. >> THE ASTRONAUTS ARE JUST AMAZING THE WAY THEY DO WORK SO SEAMLESSLY. AND AS TRAINED PROFESSIONALS, THEY MAKE IT SEEM EASY, BUT INSIDE THOSE SUITS-- BECAUSE I’VE SEEN THE SUITS COME OUT-- THERE’S A LOT OF SWEAT IN THERE. THERE’S A LOT OF HARD WORK THAT GOES ON FOR THOSE ASTRONAUTS, AND IT IS NOT EASY. AND AS YOU SAID, TRAINING ON THE GROUND IS PIVOTAL TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE ACTIVITIES LOOK SEAMLESS ON ORBIT. >> YEAH, I’M TOTALLY NOT FOLLOWING THE SCRIPT RIGHT NOW, BUT I MEAN, SO THE NBL TRAINING THAT THEY DO, THEY DO IT IN THE NEUTRAL BUOYANCY LABORATORY-- SUPER BIG POOL. THEY HAVE LIKE 1-TO-1 SCALE MOCKUPS OF THE OUTSIDE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, SO WHEN THEY ACTUALLY GO UP THERE AND THEY-- WELL, IN THE NEUTRAL BUOYANCY LABORATORY, THEY TRAIN IN A SPACESUIT, PRETTY MUCH. SO THEY KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT FEELS, AND WHERE THINGS ARE, AND THEY KNOW HOW TO MOVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE AND USE PROPER TOOLS. BECAUSE ONCE YOU’RE OUT THERE, YOU’VE GOT TO KNOW KIND OF WHAT YOU’RE DOING AND WHAT TO EXPECT, BECAUSE YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER SOME HURDLES. AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME HURDLES IN THE PAST. >> THERE HAVE BEEN, ABSOLUTELY. ALL IN THAT NEUTRAL BUOYANCY LAB, YOU’RE RIGHT. THEY ACTUALLY TRAIN IN A SPACESUIT THAT IS ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE THE ONES THEY FLY IN. SMALL LITTLE DIFFERENCES, LIKE THE WHITE BACKPACK, WHICH IS THE ENGINE OF THE SPACESUIT, THE PRIMARY LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM. IN THE NEUTRAL BUOYANCY LAB, IT IS JUST A HOLLOW SHELL AND WE HAVE UMBILICALS, LONG HOSES, THAT SUPPLY THE AIR AND THE POWER TO THE SUIT. >> RIGHT. >> AND THE TOOLS WILL HAVE THINGS THAT ARE CHANGED ON THEM TO MAKE THEM MORE NEUTRAL BUOYANT, SO THEY’LL FLOAT IN WATER AND DON’T SINK DIRECTLY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL. BUT OVERALL, IT IS, AS YOU POINTED OUT, JUST LIKE THE FLIGHT HARDWARE, AND THE SUITS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT THEY USE ON ORBIT SO THEY CAN TRAIN AND BE PREPARED. BECAUSE AS YOU NOTED, THERE IS NO GO OUT THE DOOR AND, “I’M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT I’M DOING OUT HERE. LET’S GO AHEAD AND PLAN ANOTHER DAY.” >> “LET’S FIGURE IT OUT. OH, WE CAN’T DO IT. I GUESS WE’LL COME OUT AGAIN.” BECAUSE YEAH, IT TAKES A LONG TIME, RIGHT? BECAUSE I MEAN, I WAS LISTENING TO SHANE THE OTHER DAY, BECAUSE HE JUST LANDED A COUPLE DAYS AGO AT THE TIME OF THIS RECORDING, AND HE WAS SAYING IT TAKES HOURS OF PREP WORK BEFOREHAND, RIGHT, LIKE FOUR HOURS. THEY’VE GOT TO PRE-BREATHE, THEY’VE GOT TO DO ALL THESE THINGS, PUT ON THE SUIT, AND THEN THEY GO OUT AND IT’S ANOTHER SEVEN-ISH HOURS THAT THEY’RE OUT THERE. THEN THEY COME BACK AND THEY HAVE LIKE A TWO-HOUR DEBRIEF. I MEAN, THAT’S A LONG DAY. HE CALLED IT ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING-- ESPECIALLY PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY-- CHALLENGING THINGS ABOUT FLYING IN SPACE. >> YEAH. >> I CAN IMAGINE. AND ESPECIALLY-- I MEAN, THAT’S WHAT THEY TRAIN FOR, RIGHT? >> THAT’S RIGHT. >> IN THE NEUTRAL BUOYANCY LABORATORY THEY DO LIKE SIX-HOUR RUNS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. KIND OF THE SAME, THEY DO SOME PREP WORK BEFOREHAND. BUT THEY GET USED TO IT, AND THEY DO A LOT OF THAT TRAINING. >> SO I’VE NEVER BEEN, OBVIOUSLY, OUT THE DOOR IN SPACE. I’VE NEVER BEEN AN ASTRONAUT IN THAT ASPECT, BUT GARY, ONE OF THE BEST WAYS THAT I CAN DESCRIBE WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS HAVE YOU EVER GONE SKYDIVING? >> I HAVE, ONE TIME! >> YES, THEN YOU KNOW! SO THE STIMULI WHEN YOU MAKE THAT DECISION OF “ALL RIGHT, I’M ABOUT TO GET OUT OF A PERFECTLY GOOD AIRPLANE,” AND YOU GO OUT, JUST EVERYTHING GOING ON. IT IS-- THE FIRST TIME YOU GO, IT’S VERY HARD TO CONCENTRATE. >> OH, YEAH. >> IT’S KIND OF GOOD WITH THAT TANDEM THING, THE GUY GOING, “LOOK AT YOUR ALTIMETER.” [ LAUGHTER [ BUT IMAGINE FREEFALLING LIKE THAT FOR SEVEN HOURS STRAIGHT WHILE HAVING TO DO MAINTENANCE WORK ON THE SPACE STATION AND WATCH YOUR DISPLAY CONTROL MODULE ON YOUR EMU AND LISTEN TO PEOPLE ON THE GROUND AND INSIDE THE STATION. AND THAT’S JUST A SHADOW OF THE DIFFICULTY OF THE JOB THAT THOSE GUYS DO. >> OKAY, WELL, WHEN I WENT OUT THE DOOR FOR WHENEVER I WENT SKY DIVING, MY LEGS WENT WEAK AND I ALWAYS HAD THE GUY STRAPPED TO MY BACK, AND HE HAD TO LIKE PUSH FORWARD TO THE END OF THE DOOR AND ACTUALLY LIKE PUSH ME OUT. HE DID THE WHOLE LIKE INSTEAD OF “WE’RE GOING TO GO OUT ON THREE. ONE, TWO,” AND THEN WE WENT OUT. SO I WAS LIKE-- I WAS TOTALLY WEAK, BUT I CAN’T EVEN IMAGINE. BECAUSE MY HEART DROPPED ON THAT FIRST RUN, AND THEN IT WAS THRILLING FOR A WHILE. BUT I MEAN, EVERYTHING HAPPENED SO FAST. AND NOW LIKE YOU SAID, TAKE THAT AND THEN STRETCH IT OVER A SUPER LONG PERIOD. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE. OKAY, SO LET’S TAKE A STEP BACK AND LET’S GO BACK TO KIND OF WHERE I WAS ORIGINALLY SUPPOSED TO GO, BUT TALKING ABOUT SPACESUITS, AND FIRST OF ALL, WHY DO WE NEED IT? >> SURE. >> YOU KNOW, YOU NEED THE DEXTERITY, OBVIOUSLY, BUT THERE’S A HUMAN ASPECT TO THAT, RIGHT? YOU CAN’T JUST, “OH, YOU KNOW WHAT, SOMETHING’S BROKEN ON THE OUTSIDE. LET’S JUST GO OUT THE HATCH AND TORQUE IT--” TORQUE IT, WHAT AM I SAYING? “TORQUE IT WITH A WRENCH OR SOMETHING AND FIX IT.” YOU NEED, LIKE YOU SAID, YOU HINTED AT LIFE SUPPORT A WHILE BACK WITH THE BACKPACK. SO WHAT’S IT ABOUT-- THIS MAY SEEM A BIT OBVIOUS OF A QUESTION, BUT WHAT’S IT ABOUT SPACE THAT THE HUMAN BODY CANNOT JUST GO OUT AND DO TASKS IN? >> SURE, AND YOU KNOW, I THINK MOST PEOPLE COULD TELL YOU THAT SPACE, YEAH, IT’S A DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT. BUT WHY IS IT IS WE’RE GETTING AT-- WELL, THE SPACESUIT PROVIDES THE CAPABILITY TO REGULATE TEMPERATURE. IN THE LOW EARTH ORBIT, AS WE CALL IT, WHERE THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION IS, TEMPERATURE RANGES DURING THE EVA DAYS CAN SWING FROM NEGATIVE 148 DEGREES-- SO THAT’S 148 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT BELOW ZERO UP TO 248 DEGREES. AND THOSE ARE ESTIMATES THAT CAN BE HIGHER OR LOWER, BUT THAT’S A HUGE WINDOW THAT THE HUMAN ANATOMY WAS NOT DESIGNED TO WORK WITHIN WITHOUT PROTECTION. >> YEAH, I FEEL LIKE HOUSTON, TEXAS CAN GET UP TO ABOUT POSITIVE 248 DEGREES, BUT-- I KNOW IT’S NOT EVEN CLOSE, BUT-- >> NOT NEGATIVE 148, THOUGH. >> NO, NOT EVEN-- NO, NOT EVEN 148 TO ME. BUT YOU’RE RIGHT, THAT’S INTENSE. SO HOW DOES THE SPACESUIT PROTECT FROM THAT, THE EXTREME NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE TEMPERATURES? >> YEAH, SO THERE’S A LOT OF PLANNING UP FRONT IN CHOOSING DAYS THAT WE GO EVAs, WE CALL IT-- EXTRAVEHICULAR ACTIVITIES. >> THANK YOU. >> SPACEWALKS. >> WE TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM THOSE ACRONYMS, BUT YES, SPACEWALKS, RIGHT. >> WE CHOOSE SPECIAL DAYS THAT HAVE THE LEAST IMPACT-- MORE HABITABLE CONDITIONS WOULD BE A BETTER WAY TO PUT IT. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, EVEN ON THE BEST DAYS, TEMPERATURE SWINGS WHEN THE SUN’S LOOKING AT YOU TO WHEN THE SUN’S BEHIND THE STATION ARE LARGE SWINGS THAT CAN BE 100 DEGREES. AND SO THAT’S WHERE THE SPACESUIT COMES INTO PLAY. AND THE SPACESUIT WAS DESIGNED TO WORK IN THESE ENVIRONMENTS. THERE ARE-- THE OUTER LAYER IS WHITE BECAUSE IT REFLECTS HEAT. >> AH. >> LITTLE SIMPLE THINGS LIKE THAT. >> OKAY, NOW YOU KNOW WHY THE SPACESUITS ARE WHITE. >> THERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT, WHEREAS IF IT WERE BLACK IT WOULD ABSORB THE HEAT, GET A LOT HOTTER QUICKER, AND MAKE IT HARD FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SUIT AND THE INDIVIDUAL INSIDE. THE MULTIPLE INSULATION LAYERS ON THE SUIT ITSELF-- THERE ARE SEVEN LAYERS OF INSULATION WITHIN THE OUTER LAYER OF THE SPACESUIT. >> OH. >> AND WITHOUT GETTING INTO DETAILS, THOSE ARE SPECIFICALLY TO REFLECT HEAT AND TO PROTECT THE CREW MEMBERS, AND KEEP IN THE PROPER ENVIRONMENT HEAT THAT’S NECESSARY INSIDE THE SUIT. >> OKAY. >> SO IT MAY BE HOT OUT THERE, BUT WHEN THAT SUN GOES BEHIND STATION, IT GETS VERY COLD. THAT CREW MEMBER WANTS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HEAT KEPT WITHIN THAT SPACESUIT. >> I WOULD THINK SO, YEAH. >> ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY. >> NEGATIVE 148 IS PRETTY COLD. >> BUT LOWER LEVELS OF THAT SPACESUIT IS THE BLADDER ITSELF, AND THAT GETS INTO ONE OF THE NEXT IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE SUIT, WHICH IS PROVIDING AN OXYGEN ENVIRONMENT. >> RIGHT. >> YOU’VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO BREATHE IN  SPACE, AND THERE IS A 100% OXYGEN ENVIRONMENT INSIDE THE SUIT. AND AS GARY KNOWS, AND WE’VE TALKED ABOUT IT BRIEFLY BEFORE, 100% OXYGEN ENVIRONMENT IS NOT NATURAL. >> RIGHT. >> IT’S NOT WHAT WE EXPERIENCE DOWN HERE IN AMBIENT OR ONE ATMOSPHERE PRESSURE, WHERE WE GET-- WHAT IS IT, 78% NITROGEN? >> NITROGEN, YEAH, AND A LITTLE BIT OF CARBON DIOXIDE, JUST  LITTLE BIT. >> JUST A TINY BIT, TINY BIT. BUT WHEN THE LOWER PRESSURES OF THE SUIT, THE SUIT PRESSURE IS 4.3 PSI WHEN WE GO ON SPACEWALKS. >> AND THAT’S ABOUT THE PRESSURE WE FEEL HERE ON EARTH? >> THE PRESSURE WE FEEL HERE ON EARTH IS 14.7. >> WHOA, OKAY, SO A LITTLE BIT LOWER. >> SO ALMOST A THIRD, A THIRD. >> WOW. >> CLOSE TO A THIRD, A FOURTH OF THAT. >> OKAY, SO WHAT WOULD THAT FEEL LIKE? WHAT’S THE NEXT COMPARABLE THING OF WHAT 4 PSI WOULD FEEL LIKE TO LIKE US HERE ON EARTH? >> OOH, THAT’S A TOUGH ONE. >> YEAH, HARD TO COMPARE, RIGHT? >> THAT’S A TOUGH ONE, BECAUSE I’VE BEEN INSIDE OF A SUIT SO I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE, BUT I HAVEN’T BEEN INSIDE SOMETHING ELSE THAT HAS THAT 4 PSI OF PRESSURE THAT I COULD DO A 1-TO-1 COMPARISON OF. I WOULD SAY PUTTING MULTIPLE GLOVES ON. >> OH, OKAY. YEAH, SO IT’S REALLY STRENUOUS ON YOUR HANDS, THEN? >> ABSOLUTELY. WHEN YOU’RE OUT-- COMPARED TO A NEAR ZERO PRESSURE ENVIRONMENT LIKE THE SPACE IS, 4.3 IS-- IT’S FATIGUING. YOU’VE GOT PRESSURE ON YOUR HANDS, YOUR BODY. TO MOVE, YOU’VE GOT 4.3 POUNDS OF PRESSURE OVER ALL OF YOUR BODY THAT YOU’RE WORKING AGAINST. >> PRETTY STIFF. >> THAT IS. COMPARE THAT TO THE RUSSIAN ORLAN. THEIR SUIT IS 5.8 PSI. THAT’S EVEN MORE DIFFICULT. >> WOW. >> YOU COMPARE THAT TO SOME OTHER SPACESUITS THAT WE’VE LOOKED AT IN THE PAST THAT ARE EVEN HIGHER PRESSURE, AND YOU CAN SEE WHY IT GETS-- WE NEED LOW PSI. AND SO 4.3 IS NOT PERFECT WITH ZERO RESISTANCE, BUT IT’S A NICE SWEET SPOT THAT OUR CREW MEMBERS ARE ABLE TO WORK, AND THOSE THAT HAVE RAN IN BOTH THE RUSSIAN SUIT AND THE AMERICAN SPACESUIT HAVE SAID, “YEAH, IT’S A LOT EASIER, THIS 4.3 PSI.” >> OKAY. >> YEAH. BUT THAT DRIVES US TO WHY THE OXYGEN’S AT 100%. AT THAT LOWER PRESSURE, WE NEED THE 100% OXYGEN. >> OH, OKAY. SO THAT’S HOW YOU COUNTER, YOU KNOW, WE’RE IN THE 14-SOMETHING PSI HERE, SO THEN-- >> LOWER OXYGEN CONCENTRATION. >> LOWER OXYGEN, OKAY. THAT MAKES-- AND THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THE PRE-BREATHING THAT WE KIND OF ALLUDED TO EARLIER. >> YES, SIR. >> YOU NEED TO KIND OF PURGE YOUR BODY OF NITROGEN, IS THAT RIGHT? >> THAT’S RIGHT. >> OKAY. >> THAT’S RIGHT, OTHERWISE THE OXYGEN TOXICITY IS THE CONCERN IF YOU DON’T GO TO THAT PREBREATHE PROTOCOL. >> OKAY, ALL RIGHT. WELL, AWESOME. THAT EXPLAINS WHY YOU NEED THE PRESSURE THAT YOU DO. OKAY. BUT I GUESS IF YOU WERE TO DROP IT ANY LOWER IT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH, RIGHT? LIKE 4.3 IS PROBABLY THE SWEET SPOT? >> 4.3 IS THE SWEET SPOT WITH WHAT OUR CURRENT SPACESUIT IS CERTIFIED TO. >> OH. >> YOU CAN ADJUST IT DIFFERENT WAYS. I MEAN, IT’S KIND OF LIKE IF YOU CHANGE THE PRESSURE, NOW YOU’VE GOT TO PLAY WITH THE OXYGEN. YOU’VE GOT TO PLAY WITH WHAT IS THE SUIT CAPABILITIES AT THAT LEVEL. 4.3 IS THE PERFECT SWEET SPOT FOR WHAT THIS SUIT IS CERTIFIED FOR. >> AH, I SEE. WHICH IS DOING WORK ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> COOL, VERY COOL. SO YOU’RE OUTSIDE-- YOU ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT WE’RE IN LOW EARTH ORBIT, RIGHT, MEANS WE’RE IN THE MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENT. >> YES. >> TINY BIT OF GRAVITY, NOT TOO MUCH. IS IT FAIR TO SAY A LITTLE BIT OF ATMOSPHERE, TOO? LIKE TINY, TINY BIT? >> TINY BIT. >> YEAH, THAT’S WHY WE NEED TO BOOST THE STATION EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. >> YES. >> THERE’S LIKE A TINY LITTLE BIT OF DRAG. BUT HOW MUCH ARE WE PROTECTED FROM THE EARTH’S, I GUESS, MAGNETIC SPHERE? HOW MUCH DO WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT RADIATION AT THAT ALTITUDE? >> YEAH, NO, ABSOLUTELY. GREAT QUESTION. AND IT’S A GREAT CONCERN. THERE’S A REASON THAT CREW MEMBERS ARE LIMITED FOR HOW LONG THEY CAN STAY UP ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. THAT’S ONE OF THE PLAYERS IN THERE IS THE HEALTH THEMSELF. RADIATION, I MEAN, I GUESS THE MOST HIGH LEVEL WAY TO DESCRIBE IT IS SUBATOMIC PARTICLES THAT ARE SUPERCHARGED WE GET FROM THE SUN, WE GET FROM OUTSIDE OUR MILKY WAY GALAXY, AND THAT CAN COME IN, AND THEY JUST TEAR RIGHT THROUGH YOUR DNA. AND THAT CAN BE ACUTE IF THERE’S LARGE DOSES OF RADIATION, WHICH FORTUNATELY AREN’T A CONCERN WHERE WE WORK IN LOW EARTH ORBIT. >> OH. >> BUT OVER A LONG-TERM EXPOSURE, THERE COULD BE CHRONIC EFFECTS. LIKE WHEN YOU REARRANGE THE DNA, IT CAN LEAD TO CANCER, OTHER DISEASES. SO IT’S VERY SERIOUS. WE HAVE A TEAM DEDICATED TO RADIATION AND MAKING SURE WE PROTECT OUR CREW MEMBERS. THE SPACESUIT IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF PROTECTION WHEN THEY’RE OUT THERE FOR THAT LIMITED SPACEWALK ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. THE SPACE STATION ITSELF IS ALSO DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE CREW MEMBERS FROM CERTAIN LEVELS OF RADIATION THAT WE GET FROM SOLAR WIND FROM THE SUN. >> OKAY, ALL RIGHT, YEAH. SO I GUESS THE SUIT IS DESIGNED FOR WHAT-- FOR THAT PURPOSE. >> FOR THAT PURPOSE IN LIMITED SPACEWALKS, YEAH. >> OKAY. WELL, SO HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER I GUESS EXTRAVEHICULAR SUITS? YOU KNOW, THE SUIT ITSELF HAS EVOLVED OVER TIME, RIGHT? BUT I HEARD, I THINK THE TECHNOLOGY IS SORT OF ADAPTED FROM 1970s TECHNOLOGY, AND THEN THEY JUST MADE IT A LITTLE BIT BETTER, RIGHT? >> SURE, SURE. >> YEAH. >> YEAH, SO YOU HAVE-- I MEAN, WE CAN GO RIGHT THROUGH THEM. YOU HAVE ALL THE WAY BACK FROM THE MERCURY SUITS, THE FIRST ONES WE WENT UP THERE WITH INSIDE OF THE MERCURY, AND THOSE WERE COMPLETELY DESIGNED FOR, HEY, THE CREW MEMBER IS STAYING INSIDE THIS VEHICLE. BUT IN CAS WE HAVE CABIN DEPRESSURIZATION, WE NEED THE GUYS TO HAVE A SUIT SO THAT THEY CAN EXIST FOR HOPEFULLY THE PERIOD OF TIME TO GET THE CABIN BACK PRESSURIZED. THOSE WERE EARLY SUITS. WE HAD EVEN BEFORE THAT PRESSURIZED SUITS FOR OUR PILOTS AND BALLOONISTS THAT WERE GOING HIGH ALTITUDE. >> RIGHT, YEAH, AND WE STILL DO, RIGHT? WE HAVE THE PILOTS OVER AT ELLINGTON FIELD HERE IN TEXAS THAT WEAR THOSE PRESSURIZED SUITS FOR THE WB-57s, THOSE HIGH ALTITUDE PLANES. >> YEP, YEP. >> SO THEY’RE, I GUESS-- ARE THEY TECHNICALLY IN SPACE AT THAT ALTITUDE? I THINK THEY ARE, RIGHT? IS IT 16 MILES THAT IS LIKE YOU’RE TECHNICALLY IN SPACE? >> YOU’RE GETTING BEYOND MY KNOWLEDGE HERE. >> I DON’T WANT TO GET LOST. SO MAYBE-- LISTEN-- >> YOU HEAR THINGS, BUT YEAH. BUT I KNOW THEY DO WEAR THE SUITS, AND THEY HAVE TO. THEY HAVE TO DO THE WHOLE SAME THING THAT ASTRONAUTS DO. THEY HAVE TO PREBREATHE AND ALL OF THAT KIND OF STUFF. BUT YEAH, SO-- >> THAT’S WHERE SPACESUITS STARTED FROM. >> RIGHT. >> THAT WAS THE FIRST STEPPING STONE, WAS HIGH ALTITUDE FLYING. >> YEAH. SO I GUESS THOSE MERCURY SUITS THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT, IS THAT WHERE KIND OF THE LAUNCH AND ENTRY SUITS KIND OF WENT TOWARDS? WHENEVER YOU’RE LAUNCHING INTO SPACECRAFT, YOU HAVE TO WEAR A SPECIFIC SUIT IN CASE OF THAT, RIGHT, SUDDEN DEPRESSURIZATION? IS THAT LIKE THE REASON? >> SO ABSOLUTELY, THE MERCURY SUIT WAS A-- YOU KNOW, WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF THOSE WHO DESIGNED THAT MERCURY SUIT. AND HE NEXT SUIT WAS GEMINI AFTER THAT, AND THE NEXT ONE AFTER THAT, AND ALL THE DAY TO APOLLO-- YES, ABSOLUTELY DO THOSE PROVIDE DATA AND INSIGHT TOWARDS THE ACES SUIT, OR THE LAUNCH AND ENTRY SUIT THAT WE’RE NOW WORKING ON FOR NEXT VEHICLES. >> OH, RIGHT. >> SO YES, DATA FROM THOSE SUITS WAS PIVOTAL TO MAKE OUR CURRENT LAUNCH AND ENTRY SUITS. I MEAN, ONE OF THE MOST-- THE GEMINI SUIT THAT CAME AFTER THE MERCURY, THAT WAS THE ONE THAT ED WHITE WENT OUT ON HIS EVA IN. THAT WAS THE MOST POLARIZING OR ONE OF THE MOST WELL KNOWN ONES THAT YOU’LL SEE IN A LOT OF THE OLD MOVIES WITH THE ALUMINIZED NYLON OUTER COVERING, WHERE IT’S ALL SHINY, AND A LOT OF ZIPPERS HERE AND THERE. >> CHROME. >> YEAH. EVERY MOVIE THAT EVER HAD SCIENCE FICTION LAID TO IT-- MY PARENTS WATCHED-- I REMEMBER SEEING THE SHINY SUITS. >> YEAH. >> AND SO THAT’S GEMINI. >> YEAH. >> TO SET THE TONE ON THAT. AND THE REASON FOR THE SHINY SUITS WAS THEY WERE IN THAT TIME-- WE HAD A LOT OF DATA, BUT THE BIG CONCERNS WERE THERMAL AND RADIATION, AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER. AND SO YOU’LL SEE THAT ALUMINIZED MATERIAL ON THE GEMINI SUIT EARLY ON, BECAUSE THEY REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE GUYS WHO PROTECTED, SO THEY WENT ALL OUT. AS  WE GOT MORE DATA AND WE FIGURED OUT WHAT WE NEEDED AND WHERE WE NEED TO GROW IN, AND WHERE WE DIDN’T NEED SO MUCH, YOU SAW THAT SHINY ALUMINUM OR NYLON, IT WENT AWAY. >> RIGHT, YEAH. AND NOW WE SEE THE WHITE SUIT. >> YOU GOT IT. >> ALL RIGHT, YEAH. AND THEN WE SAW THE FAMOUS WHITE ONES LIKE ON THE MOON, WALKING ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON. >> THE APOLLO SUITS. >> THE APOLLO SUITS. AND THEN WE-- NOW WE HAVE THE WHITE SUITS ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION THAT WE USE ALL THE TIME. SO KIND OF GOING THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF THE FEATURES OF THOSE SUITS, I WANT TO-- I ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW, WHENEVER YOU LOOK AT A SPACESUIT, THE FIRST THING, I THINK, YOUR EYES GO TO IS THAT SHIELD, THAT GOLD SHIELD. WHAT IS THAT? >> YEAH, SO THE-- I THINK THE TERM IS GOLDIZED. >> OOH. >> YES. >> I LIKE THAT. >> THAT GOLD VISOR IS LIKE BASICALLY VERY FANCY SUNGLASSES. >> COOL. >> SO THE VISOR ITSELF IF A LEXAN MATERIAL THAT YOU’LL FIND IN SOME OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD GOODS. IT IS SPECIFICALLY TO PROTECT THE CREW MEMBERS’ EYES FROM SUN. >> OKAY. >> AND SO THERE’S A GOLD SHEET THAT GOES OVER THAT. IT HAS GREAT CHARACTERISTICS OF BLOCKING HARMFUL UV RAYS AND OTHER RAYS THAT WOULD COME FROM THE SUN, AND HELP THE ASTRONAUT CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO WORK IN THAT SPACEWALK ENVIRONMENT. >> BUT THEY CAN KIND OF PULL IT UP, RIGHT, DURING NIGHTTIMES. IT’S LIKE SUNGLASSES ARE. IF YOU WALK FROM OUTSIDE TO INSIDE AND IT’S SUDDENLY DARK, YOU TAKE YOUR SUNGLASSES OFF. SO IT’S KIND OF-- >> SURE, THEY’VE GOT A COOL KNOB ON THE SIDE OF THE HELMET. YOU JUST FLIP THAT VISOR UP, AND WHAT YOU REALLY NEAT IS THERE ARE OPAQUE VISORS ON THE SIDE THAT WE RARELY SEE IN PICTURES. >> RIGHT. >> MOST PICTURES YOU WANT TO SEE THE FACE OR AT LEAST THE COOL GOLD VISOR. BUT THERE ARE COMPLETELY OPAQUE WHITE VISORS THAT CAN COVER-- MAYBE IF THE SUN’S ON YOUR RIGHT SIDE, IT CAN BLOCK ON THE RIGHT, OR THE LEFT, OR HALFWAY DOWN THE FRONT. AND THEN THE GOLD VISOR, AS YOU POINTED OUT, CAN COMPLETELY COVER YOUR FACE AT FULL SUN, OR PARTIALLY, OR JUST COMPLETELY REMOVE IT ALL TOGETHER. SLIDES BACK BEHIND THE HELMET BUBBLE UNDERNEATH. OH, OKAY. OH, SO I’M THINKING ABOUT THE PICTURE OF-- I WANT TO SAY IT’S ON APOLLO 17, RIGHT, WHERE YOU HAVE THE-- I THINK IT WAS GENE CERNAN, I THINK, POSING, AND THEN HE HAS TWO OF THOSE OPAQUE VISORS DOWN-- >> AH, NOW I’M WITH YOU, YEAH. >> YEAH, AND HE’S GOT THE EARTH BEHIND HIM OR SOMETHING. >> YOU GOT IT, YOU GOT IT. >> I’M THINKING ABOUT THAT PICTURE RIGHT NOW. SO IF YOU DON’T KNOW THAT PICTURE, GO LOOK THAT ONE UP, BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT HE’S TALKING ABOUT WITH THESE OPAQUE VISORS. IT’S LIKE THOSE WHITE SHIELDS THAT COME DOWN ON THE SIDES. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> COOL. >> AND THE APOLLO SUITS ARE THE FIRST SUITS WITH THAT FAMOUS FISHBOWL TYPE HELMET. REMEMBER THAT? IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR EARLIER SUITS, THEY HAVE ROUND VISORS THAT ARE FIXED, BUT THEY’RE MORE OVAL OR SMALLER IN SHAPE, SO IT’S LIMITED VIEW. IN THE APOLLO SUITS, AND YOU’LL SEE IT ON THE CURRENT SUITS ON THE STATION, YOU HAVE THE FULL FISHBOWL HELMETS SO YOU CAN ALMOST HAVE A COMPLETE VIEW SIDE TO SIDE IN FRONT, A LITTLE ABOVE, LIMITED BELOW BY THE NECK RING, BUT A MUCH BIGGER FIELD OF VIEW FROM THE APOLLO AND THE CURRENT SUITS WE HAVE TODAY. >> AND THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE PERFECT REASON TO DO IT, RIGHT-- THEY LEARNED. THEY SAID, “ALL RIGHT, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A BIGGER FIELD OF VIEW,” SO THEY DESIGNED A HELMET AND THEN WENT, “OKAY, NOW I CAN SEE A LOT MORE.” SO WHAT’S THE-- I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I ALWAYS WANTED TO ASK IS I’M SURE-- YOU’RE OUTSIDE DOING A SPACEWALK FOR HOURS, RIGHT. YOUR NOSE HAS TO GET ITCHY. >> MAN, YOU KNEW YOUR NOSE WOULD GET ITCHY. [ LAUGHTER ] >> HOW DO YOU-- LIKE WHAT IF YOU JUST FEEL AN ITCH? LIKE, WHERE DO YOU GO? >> YEAH, SO-- >> DON’T THEY HAVE LIKE VELCRO OR SOMETHING? LIKE HARD VELCRO THEY CAN SCRUB THEIR NOSE ON OR SOMETHING? >> SO THERE ARE. THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED A VALSALVA. IT’S A STRANGE NAME, BUT IT’S KIND OF A-- NOT TO GET TOO INTO THE DETAILS-- IT’S A FOAM BLOCK THAT’S FIXED INSIDE THE HELMET ON THE NECK RING. >> OKAY. >> NOW, THE PURPOSE OF THIS ITEM THAT’S CALLED A VALSALVA IS FOR WHEN YOU’RE GOING THROUGH PREBREATHE AND YOU’RE PRESSURIZING THE SUIT BEFORE GOING OUT THE DOOR. LIKE WHEN YOU GO UP IN AN AIRPLANE, ONCE THAT CABIN STARTS PRESSURIZING, YOUR EARS CAN POP. THAT’S UNCOMFORTABLE. FOR US FLYING IN A PLANE, AND ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE INSIDE OF A SPACESUIT. ONLY THEY CAN’T GRAB THEIR NOSE AND BLOW THE AIR OUT TO EQUAL THE PRESSURIZATION. SO THEY HAVE THESE VALSALVAS THEY CAN FIT ON THEIR NOSE, AND THEY CAN KIND OF-- IT SERVES THE PURPOSE OF BLOCKING THE NASAL PASSAGE SO THEY CAN MAKE SURE THAT THEIR EARS DON’T POP. >> OH! >> SO YOU CAN SWALLOW, OR YOU CAN PUSH DOWN YOUR NOSE ON THIS BLOCK TO EQUALISE THE PRESSURE THERE. AND ALL THAT LONG STORY TO SAY, IF YOU CAN REACH YOUR NOSE DOWN THERE AND SCRATCH ON THAT BLOCK, THAT COULD BE AN OPTION, OTHERWISE YOU’RE OUT OF LUCK. >> YEAH, YEAH. WELL, I DIDN’T EVEN THINK ABOUT THAT. LIKE I WAS THINKING ABOUT ITCHY NOSE, BUT OF COURSE-- WHAT IF YOUR EARS HAVE TO POP? NOW YOU HAVE A THING TO DO THAT, TOO. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> THAT’S PRETTY COOL. >> LIKE YOU SAID EARLIER, IT’S THROUGH THESE GENERATIONS OF SUIT EVOLUTION THEY’VE LEARNED ALONG THE WAY, WITH GREAT CREW FEEDBACK OF “HEY, WE NEED THIS.” >> YEAH, YEAH, EXACTLY. WELL, YEAH. YOU’VE BEEN DOING-- THE FIRST SPACEWALK WAS, WE SAID, IN 1965. SO YOU HAVE A LOT TO LEARN FROM THE MID-60s TO NOW, OBVIOUSLY. SO WHAT ABOUT LIKE-- I MEAN, AGAIN, THINKING ABOUT YOU’RE OUTSIDE FOR THAT LONG. WHEN DO YOU EAT? DO YOU EAT LIKE RIGHT BEFOREHAND? LIKE BEFORE OR AFTER THE PREBREATHE? LIKE, I WOULD JUST GET SO HUNGRY. I HAVE TO EAT LIKE EVERY TWO TO THREE HOURS. >> I’M WITH YOU, GARY. THAT’S PROBABLY THE ONLY REASON WE’RE NOT ASTRONAUTS-- WE’VE GOT TO EAT EVERY TWO OR THREE HOURS. >> THAT WOULD BE, HONESTLY-- EVERYTHING ELSE I QUALIFY FOR, OBVIOUSLY, BUT I HAVE TO EAT EVERY TWO OR THREE HOURS, OR I CAN’T. [ LAUGHTER ] >> SO I WOULD SAY THAT’S CREW MEMBER SPECIFIC, WHERE YOU SEE AS-- I DON’T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT WHEN I WOULD RUN MARATHONS, I HAD FRIENDS THAT COULD EAT A BURGER BEFORE A MARATHON WITH NO PROBLEM. THAT’S NOT THIS GUY. >> NOT THIS GUY, EITHER. NO WAY. >> AND SO, SAME THING WITH CREW MEMBERS. YOU HAVE SOME THAT-- THEY HAVE A LOT OF TIME EARLIER ON WHERE IT’S RECOMMENDED, “DO NOT EAT PAST THIS TIME.” AND THERE ARE SOME THAT’LL EAT RIGHT UP ALONG THAT BARRIER, AND THERE ARE SOME THAT’LL STOP EATING WAY BEFORE THAT. BECAUSE NATURALLY, WHEN YOU EAT, NOT ONLY DOES IT SUPPLY ENERGY TO YOUR BODY, BUT IT ALSO CAUSES NORMAL BODILY FUNCTIONS AS WELL, WHICH LEADS INTO ANOTHER DISCUSSION. [ LAUGHTER ] >> THAT’S RIGHT. LET’S GO INTO THAT ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, SO, SEVEN HOURS. AGAIN, YOU’RE OUT THERE FOR A LONG TIME. YOU’VE GOT TO GO TO THE BATHROOM. >> THAT’S RIGHT. >> WHAT DO THEY DO? >> YEAH, THAT’S A CALL THAT YOU HAVE TO ANSWER. >> RIGHT, RIGHT. >> SO UNFORTUNATELY, AS WE SAID EARLIER, WHEN YOU’RE OUT IN A SPACEWALK, YOU CAN’T JUST SAY, “HEY JOHN, I’M GOING TO HEAD INSIDE AND HIT THE JOHN.” YOU’RE STUCK OUT THERE FOR THE DURATION. >> OH, YEAH. AND EVERY MOMENT IS PLANNED, RIGHT? >> THAT’S RIGHT. >> SO YOU CAN’T-- YOU HAVE TO JUST DO YOUR THING. >> YES, ABSOLUTELY. AND SO THERE IS NO TOILET INSIDE THE SUIT. THEY HAVE-- AN ACRONYM WOULD BE THE MAG, AND IT’S BASICALLY AN ABSORPTION GARMENT. >> AS IN MAXIMUM? >> YOU’VE GOT IT, MY FRIEND. >> ALL RIGHT! >> YOU’VE GOT IT, YOU’VE GOT IT. >> BRING THAT ABSORBENCY UP TO MAXIMUM. >> SO IT’S BASICALLY A VERY LARGE DEPENDS DIAPER THAT THEY’LL WEAR ON THESE SPACEWALKS. NOW, I CAN TELL YOU, ANYONE WHO’S BEEN INSIDE A SUIT HAS ZERO DESIRE TO USE THAT DIAPER. >> YES, I CAN IMAGINE. >> ABSOLUTELY. BUT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS GLAD IT’S THERE IF THEY GET THAT CALL. >> YES, YEAH. OKAY, YEAH. I COULD TOTALLY SEE THAT. AND THERE’S WATER, TOO, IN THE SUIT IN CASE YOU GET THIRSTY? >> ABSOLUTELY. SAME THING WITH THE MARATHON-- YOU’VE GOT TO HAVE HYDRATION, AND SO THEY HAVE WHAT THEY CALL DISPOSABLE IN SUIT DRINK BAGS. SITS RIGHT HERE ON THE CHEST, ACTUALLY VELCROS TO THE LIQUID COOLING VENTILATION GARMENT, WHICH IS HOW THEY GET THE COOLANT INSIDE THE SUIT. >> AH. >> OVER 300 FEET OF LITTLE TUBES RUN OVER THEIR ENTIRE BODY THAT CAN PROVIDE WARM OR COLD WATER THAT THE CREW MEMBER CAN ADJUST AS THEY PREFER ON A TEMPERATURE CONTROL VALVE. >> IT’S LIKE A SPACE VERSION OF AIR CONDITIONING. >> THAT’S RIGHT, LOWER THERMOSTAT RIGHT THERE. >> I’M TOO COLD. I’M JUST GOING TO TURN THE HEAT UP. OH, YEAH. >> THERE YOU GO. WELL, SITTING ON TOP OF THAT IS THAT BAG WITH WATER. >> YEAH. >> AND THEY’LL TAKE OUT 32-ISH OUNCES OF WATER AS SUITS THEM. >> OKAY, ALL RIGHT. SO THEY HAVE A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT THEY NEED. OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TO PLAN FOR THAT IF YOU’RE GOING TO GO OUT IN SPACE FOR THAT LONG. THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. SO LET’S SEE. HOW MUCH DO THEY WEIGH? THAT’S A BIG QUESTION, RIGHT? >> A BIG QUESTION, AND BIG WEIGHT. >> YEAH. >> SO EVERY SUIT THAT’S AN EMU-- HERE I AM WITH ACRONYMS AGAIN-- THE SPACESUIT THAT OUR CREW MEMBERS USE, OUR U.S. CREW MEMBERS USE IS DESIGNED TO FIT FROM THE 5th PERCENTILE UP TO THE 95th PERCENTILE OF MEN AND WOMEN. AND SO WITH THAT, YOU HAVE CERTAIN COMPONENTS THAT ARE INTERCHANGEABLE AND DO NOT CHANGE. WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS LIKE THE HARD UPPER TORSO-- PICTURE THE TORSO OF THE SUIT. >> YES. >> YOU’VE GOT THREE SIZES, AND THE MAJORITY OF CREW MEMBERS MIGHT USE A LARGE, FOR EXAMPLE. AND THEY SHARE THAT LARGE BETWEEN THEM. BUT ALL THE PIECES THAT CONNECT TO THE SUIT, THE ARMS, THE GLOVES, THE BOOTS, THOSE CAN ADJUST IN SIZE. AND SO IF IT’S A SMALLER SIZE IT’S GOING TO WEIGH LESS. IF IT’S A LARGER SIZE, IT’LL WEIGH MORE. BUT OVERALL, THE AVERAGE WEIGHT OF A SPACESUIT ITSELF IS ABOUT 270 POUNDS. >> WOW! >> YEAH. >> OKAY, THAT’S PRETTY HEAVY. WELL, ON EARTH, RIGHT? SO IT’S GOT SOME WEIGHT. SO HOW WOULD-- I GUESS 300 POUNDS IN SPACE WOULD BE NOT SO HARD TO MOVE AROUND, RIGHT? I GUESS YOU’RE IN THE MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENT. BUT LIKE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER, IT’S THAT PRESSURE. IT’S THE PRESSURE INSIDE WHERE YOU HAVE THE GLOVES AND YOU’RE TRYING TO SQUEEZE YOUR HANDS, AND THAT’S KIND OF THE HARD PART. >> SURE. YEAH, WHAT CAN BE OUR FRIEND AT TIMES IS MOMENTUM OR INERTIA. AND THAT CAN BE AN ENEMY AT TIMES AS WELL, WHEN YOU’RE IN THAT MICRO ENVIRONMENT. SO CREW MEMBERS ARE TRAINED SPECIFICALLY TO GO SLOW ALONG A SPACE STATION. IF YOU GET 300 POUNDS MOVING, IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO STOP. NOW, THEY CAN STOP IT, BUT IT’S JUST WASTED ENERGY. SO THEY GO VERY SLOWLY SO THEY DON’T GET THAT LARGE MASS MOVING TOO QUICKLY. >> I’D ASSUME IT ALSO HELPS WITH CONSERVING ENERGY, TOO, RIGHT?  >> THAT’S RIGHT. >> SO NOT ONLY DO YOU CONSIDER AND MAKE SURE YOU CAN HAVE CONTROLLED MOVEMENT, AND YOU’RE GOING THE RIGHT PACE, AND YOU DON’T FLY EVERYWHERE, USING THAT LIMITED AMOUNT OF ENERGY BECAUSE YOU’RE CARRYING EVERYTHING WITH YOU, RIGHT? WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THE NEUTRAL BUOYANCY LABORATORY, YOU HAVE UMBILICALS THAT HOOK UP TO ALL THE OXYGEN AND  EVERYTHING YOU WANT, BUT YOU ONLY HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT WITH YOU. BECAUSE IT’S LIKE BACKPACKING, IN SPACE, WITH A LOT MORE TECHNOLOGY. >> YES, YES. >> BUT YEAH, SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO CONSERVE. YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE-- YOU HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF OXYGEN, SO YOU HAVE TO BREATHE SLOWLY AND MAKE SURE YOUR HEART RATE’S NOT GOING UP, YOU’RE CALM WHEN YOU’RE DOING IT. >> GREAT POINT. >> YEAH, OKAY. BECAUSE I REMEMBER LISTENING WHEN WE WERE ON THE EVA, DOING THE EVA-- LIKE I WAS SAYING, THE SPACEWALK. >> THERE YOU GO WITH YOUR ACRONYMS. >> WE WERE DOING THE SPACEWALK JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, AND YEAH, THEY WERE SAYING YOU’VE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU TAKE YOUR TIME  WHEN YOU’RE MOVING AROUND. BECAUSE YOU’RE OUT THERE FOR-- PLAN SIX AND A HALF, IT CAN GO UP TO SEVEN. LAST TIME IT WAS SEVEN HOURS, FOUR MINUTES. IT CAN GO UP TO EIGHT, AND I THINK THE LONGEST SPACEWALK EVER WAS ALMOST NINE. IT WAS LIKE 8 HOURS, 52 MINUTES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. >> IT WAS CLOSE. >> THAT’S A LONG TIME TO BE OUT THERE, AND YOU’VE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU’RE CONSERVING THAT ENERGY. SO LET’S TALK ABOUT-- YOU BRIEFLY MENTIONED THAT THIS IS WHAT THE EMU IS MEANT TO DO, AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU GET CERTIFIED TO DO THIS, THAT-- WHAT’S HAPPENING NOW TO DESIGN FUTURE SUITS? ESPECIALLY NOT-- BECAUSE THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION IS GOING TO BE THERE FOR THE NEXT HOPEFULLY DECADE, I WOULD THINK. >> SURE. >> BUT AFTER THAT WE’RE TALKING ABOUT DEEP SPACE. WE’RE TALKING ABOUT PLANETARY EXPLORATION. WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE ABOUT THE SUIT TO MEET THOSE NEEDS? >> YEAH, SO WE HAVE A LOT OF DATA ON WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE, BUT THERE’S A LOT OF DATA THAT WE DON’T KNOW YET. >> RIGHT, BECAUSE WE HAVEN’T BEEN THERE. >> THAT’S RIGHT, SO LIKE THE PIONEERS WITH THE HIGH ALTITUDE FLYING FOUND, “HEY, MY SUIT IS ONLY DESIGNED TO GO UP AT 5,000 FEET, AND NOW I’M AT 40,000 FEET. I THINK I’M REACHING THAT ENVELOPE.” YOU NEED NEW MATERIALS. YOU NEED NEW VEHICLES. WE’RE GOING TO FIND OUT THE SAME THING WITH THE SUIT. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE CURRENT SPACESUIT THAT SERVES FANTASTICALLY AT THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION IS NOT A PLANETARY SUIT. MOBILITY WILL BE AN ISSUE. IT IS NOT MEANT TO WALK IN IN A GRAVITY ENVIRONMENT. THINGS WE’LL HAVE TO LOOK INTO IS-- EVEN THE APOLLO SUIT, WHICH WAS LIGHTER, A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBLE, HAD SOME DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS TO ALLOW THE CREW MEMBERS TO STOOP DOWN AND PICK UP ROCKS WHERE THE CURRENT SUIT COULDN’T. EVEN THAT SUIT, THERE WAS LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES THERE WHERE THEY DIDN’T EXPECT THE AMOUNT OF DUST AND DIRT THAT WOULD COME IN AND GET INSIDE ALL THE SEALS. AND IT SOUNDS MINOR, BUT CLEANLINESS CAN HAVE CATASTROPHIC RESULTS IF YOU DON’T HAVE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF CLEANLINESS. >> THAT’S RIGHT. THEY’RE TINY LITTLE THINGS.  >> THAT’S RIGHT. IF THEY GET INSIDE SEAL AND SURFACES, YOU COULD HAVE A LEAK, AND A LEAK IS SOMETHING THAT YOU DO NOT WANT WHEN YOU’RE OUT DOING A SPACEWALK. SO THERE ARE-- THE SHORT ANSWER IS OUR CURRENT SUITS ARE CERTIFIED FOR THE LOW EARTH ENVIRONMENT, FROM RADIATION REQUIREMENTS, TO THERMAL REQUIREMENTS, TO-- YOU DON’T REALLY NEED MOBILITY IN YOUR LOWER HALF. YOU JUST NEED YOUR UPPER BODY TO BE ABLE TO MOVE. REMEMBER, YOUR HANDS ARE SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS YOU HAVE ON SPACE STATION. YOUR FEET AND LEGS ARE NEAR USELESS. THEY GET A LITTLE BIT OF USE, BUT NOT A WHOLE LOT. WELL, PLANETARY SUITS, WE’RE GOING TO NEED LEGS AND FEET. WE’RE GOING TO NEED TO USE THEM A LOT. >> DEFINITELY. >> AS YOU WERE HITTING ON EARLIER, AT THE LUNAR ACTIVITIES, WE’RE ONLY FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. BUT IF WE GO TO MARS, AND IF WE LAND ON MARS, WE’RE GOING TO BE OUT THERE FOR A LOT MORE THAN A COUPLE OF DAYS. SO WE NEED A SUIT THAT’S ROBUST ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THOSE REQUIREMENTS. >> OKAY, SO I HAVE-- I’M SURE YOU’VE SEEN THE MOVIE “THE MARTIAN,” RIGHT? >> I HAVE! >> YEAH, IT’S A GOOD MOVIE. IT’S A GOOD MOVIE. SO IN THAT ONE, WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT A PLANETARY SUIT, THEY HAD THOSE LIKE SKINTIGHT ORANGE THINGS. THEY LOOKED SUPER COOL. >> AWESOME SUITS. >> YEAH, THEY LOOKED AWESOME. BUT THEN WHEN THEY WERE UP ORBITING MARS, AND THEY HAD THAT WHOLE-- I DON’T WANT TO-- IN CASE ANYONE HASN’T SEEN IT-- >> SPOILER ALERT. >> WHICH, IF YOU HAVEN’T SEEN IT, WHAT’S WRONG WITH YOU? YOU NEED TO SEE IT. BUT THEY HAD-- WHEN THEY WERE ORBITING EARTH, THEY HAD THE EMU. THEY HAD THAT BIG WHITE SUIT. AND THEN IT GOT A LITTLE TIGHTER, SKINTIGHT. IS THERE A CHANCE THAT MAYBE A PLANETARY SUIT WOULD BE SKINTIGHT, OR DO YOU NEED THOSE EXTRA LAYERS? >> SO YEAH, GREAT QUESTION. IT DEPENDS ON WHAT PLANET WE GO TO. >> OKAY. >> I MEAN, YOU HIT ON EARLIER THAT THERE’S A LITTLE BIT OF ATMOSPHERE IN THE LOW EARTH ORBIT THAT PROTECTS THE STATION TO A CERTAIN EXTENT AND CAUSES DRAG. WELL, ON MARS THERE’S ATMOSPHERE, AS WELL, WHEREAS OTHER PLANETS OR OTHER MOONS AROUND OTHER PLANETS THAT MAYBE IN THE FUTURE WE’LL LOOK AT GOING TO, WILL HAVE NEAR ZERO ATMOSPHERE. THAT’S WHERE YOU’LL NEED THE MULTIPLE LAYERS, LIKE IN OUR EMU RIGHT NOW. WHEN YOU HAVE THAT VERY MINIMAL ATMOSPHERE. M>> OKAY. >> THE MARS, WE SHOULD HAVE MORE OF AN ATMOSPHERE. WHAT YOU WANT THERE-- WHERE WE MAY GET TO MORE MULTIPLE LAYERS IS IF WE NEED A-- IF THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT AVAILABLE TO HAVE ROBUSTNESS IN A SKINTIGHT SUIT, THEN YOU’LL GET THE MULTIPLE LAYERS. >> OH, OKAY. >> BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU DON’T WANT A SUIT THAT’S GOING TO WEAR OUT AND GET A HOLE SOONER. THEN YOU’RE IN TROUBLE OUT THERE. >> RIGHT. >> BUT ABSOLUTELY, THOSE SKINTIGHT SUITS LIKE MATT DAMON  HAD IN “THE MARTIAN,” AND THERE’S EVEN BEEN SOME PLAYED AROUND WITH HERE IN THE U.S. THAT WE’VE DONE SOME STUDIES FOR ADVANCED SUITS. THOSE ARE BY FAR PREFERRED IN THE ASPECTS OF MOBILITY. YOU CAN MOVE AROUND IN THOSE A LOT EASIER WITHOUT GETTING PAIN OR ABRASION FROM MULTIPLE LAYERS RUBBING ON  YOU. YOU MENTIONED BACKPACKING EARLIER. WELL, IF YOU HAD A COUPLE PAIRS OF JEANS ON AT ONE TIME, AND THEN A NUMBER OF SHIRTS ON, AND THEN A BACKPACK, YOU’RE GOING GET BLISTERS AND PAIN IN PLACES. YOU DON’T WANT TO FEEL THAT. THAT’S THE TRADE OFF FOR IF YOU GET A SUIT WITH A LOT OF LAYERS OF INSULATION AND WHATNOT, AND THEN YOU TRY TO WALK DISTANCES. THAT’S GOING TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE. >> YEAH. IF THEY DO, THEY’LL PROBABLY HAVE TO DO SHORT EVAs, OR SPACEWALKS. >> OR A LUNAR ROVER. >> OH, THAT’S WHERE THE ROVER COMES IN. SO I’VE SEEN THEY HAVE ONE HERE AT THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER CALLED THE SUV. IT’S LIKE AN ANALOG. THEY SEE-- IT LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE THE ONE THAT WAS IN “THE MARTIAN.” IN FACT, “THE MARTIAN” KIND OF COPIED US. BUT THAT’S FINE. >> I’M OKAY WITH THAT. >> IN THE BACK, THEY HAD SUITS ON THE OUTSIDE. >> YES. >> THERE’S A REASON  FOR THAT, RIGHT? >> YES. >> AND THAT WAS THAT DUST THING THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT A LITTLE BIT. >> YES, YES, THAT ABSOLUTELY PLAYS INTO IT. ONE OF THE COOL THINGS ABOUT THE CURRENT SUIT WE HAVE TODAY IS JUST THE LARGE PERCENTILE OF INDIVIDUALS THAT CAN FIT INTO IT. MAYBE NOT PERFECTLY, BUT THEY CAN GET INSIDE THAT SUIT, SMALL OR LARGE, AND GO OUT AND DO AN EVA, WHEREAS THE OTHER SUITS THAT ARE FIXED IN SIZING-- I’M GONNA USE-- OBVIOUSLY THE ORLAN HAS BEEN GREAT FOR MANY YEARS. NOT  HITTING THAT AT ALL, JUST SHOWING THE DIFFERENCES. >> RIGHT. >> YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE CUT SIZE. I MEAN, YOU EITHER HAVE A 37 INCH TO 44 INCH CHEST, AND YOU CAN FIT IN THERE, OR YOU CAN’T. >> OH. >> AND SO THERE’S GREAT THINGS ABOUT THAT. ONE OF THE BAD THINGS ABOUT THE EMU SUIT WHERE THOSE-- IS THAT YOU DON’T GET A LOT OF SHOULDER MOVEMENT, AND IT’S A LOT LONGER TO GET IN WHEN YOU HAVE TO PUT THE SUIT TOGETHER. ON THE GROUND WITH TECH SUPPORT, WE CAN GET THEM IN THERE IN 45 MINUTES. WHEN THEY’RE ON ORBIT, IT’S DIFFICULT TO SLIDE UP INSIDE THAT HARD UPPER TORSO. ALL RIGHT, NOW I HAVE TO PUT MY GLOVES ON, HELMET ON. NOW I’VE GOT TO PUT PANTS ON. I EXPLAINED IT IN 20 SECONDS. THOSE GUYS ARE TAKING OVER AN HOUR WITH HELP, PROFESSIONALLY TRAINED PEOPLE, TO GET INSIDE THAT SUIT. >> RIGHT. >> SO YOU HIT ON THAT SUIT ON THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE. IT OPENS UP INSIDE THAT VEHICLE. YOU CAN CRAWL INTO THAT SUIT FROM INSIDE YOUR VEHICLE WITHOUT HAVING TO DEPRESSURIZE THE WHOLE VEHICLE, CLOSE THAT HATCH ON THE SUIT, AND THEN WALK RIGHT OFF THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE. >> SWEET. >> PRETTY NEAT. >> THAT’S AWESOME, BUT YOU’RE RIGHT. YOU HAVE A SIZE THING TO CONSIDER BECAUSE YOU DON’T HAVE THAT ADJUSTABLE FEATURES OF THE EMU THAT’S ON STATION RIGHT NOW. >> BUT SINCE THE EMU WAS DESIGNED, THERE IS TECHNOLOGY THAT’S ALLOWED US TO VERY QUICKLY ADJUST THE SIZE ON SOME OF THOSE FIXED SUITS THAT FORMERLY WE COULDN’T. SO THAT’S NOT AN ISSUE TODAY, ALTHOUGH IT WAS IN THE ‘80s WHEN WE DESIGNED THE EMU. >> RIGHT. WOW. THAT IS SO COOL. OKAY, ONE MORE QUESTION, AND THEN I’M GOING TO LET YOU GO. SO WE TALKED ABOUT “THE MARTIAN” AND THOSE SKINTIGHT SUITS, BUT THERE WAS ONE SCENE IN THERE THAT HE WAS KIND OF FLOATING AROUND. AND, WELL, OKAY,  I’M NOT GOING TO DO ANY SPOILERS, BUT BASICALLY HE HAD TO-- HE HAD TO-- >> I HEAR SPOILER. >> OKAY, IF YOU HAVEN’T SEEN “THE MARTIAN” YET, TURN OFF THE PODCAST. I’LL GIVE YOU THREE SECONDS. ONE, TWO, THREE. OKAY, SO HE POKES A HOLE IN HIS GLOVE ON THE OUTSIDE, AND HE HAS TO PROPEL HIMSELF OUT INTO THE THING. >> YES. >> IS THAT LIKE A THING? CAN THAT HAPPEN? I MEAN, IT PROBABLY CAN’T BE SUCCESSFUL LIKE IT WAS IN “THE MARTIAN,” BUT IS THAT A THING? IF YOU WERE TO POKE A HOLE, WOULD YOU PROPEL YOURSELF? >> SO-- MAN. SO THERE’S DEFINITELY SOME HOLLYWOOD ASPECTS TO THAT, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. >> YES, YES. >> BUT YES, IN THEORY, YOU HAVE A PRESSURIZED SUIT. YOU’VE GOT TWO PRIMARY OXYGEN TANKS, AND THEN YOU HAVE A SECONDARY OXYGEN TANK THAT HOLDS JUST IN ITSELF ABOUT 6,000 POUNDS OF PRESSURE OF OXYGEN. SO IF YOU HAVE A HOLE AND YOU’RE PUSHING OUT AIR, EVEN IF IT’S A LOW FORCE, IT WILL GET THAT BODY MOVING. NOW, I CAN’T TELL YOU THAT IT’S GOING TO FLY YOU TO A DIFFERENT SPACECRAFT LIKE IN THE MOVIE, BUT IT WOULD BE SOME LEVEL OF PROPULSION, AND IT WOULD HELP YOU OUT. >> THAT IS SO COOL. ALL RIGHT, COOL. I JUST LOVE THAT MOVIE. THAT’S WHY I KEEP BRINGING IT UP. >> IT’S A GREAT MOVIE. >> IT’S A GOOD ONE. WELL, I THINK THAT’S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE, LES. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. THIS WAS SO INTERESTING, BUT I’M SURE WE DID NOT HIT ALL OF THE POINTS ABOUT SPACESUITS. THERE’S A LOT MORE TO THIS TOPIC. >> MY HUGE BINDER WASN’T USED. >> SO IF YOU’RE LISTENING AND YOU DO HAVE QUESTIONS, MAKE SURE TO SUBMIT THEM. STAY TUNED ‘TIL AFTER THE LITTLE ENDING MUSIC CREDITS HERE, AND THEN WE’LL TALK ABOUT WHERE YOU CAN SUBMIT SOME IDEAS. AND MAYBE WE’LL DO A SPACESUITS NUMBER TWO EPISODE. WHO KNOWS. I’M SURE THERE’S MORE WE COULD TALK ABOUT. SO THANKS AGAIN, LES, AND STICK AROUND FOR MORE ON SPACESUITS. >> THANKS FOR HAVING ME, GARY. >> NO PROBLEM. ALL RIGHT. [ MUSIC ] [ INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ] >> WELCOME TO SPACE. >> HEY, THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND. SO TODAY WE TALKED WITH LES PADILLA ABOUT SPACESUITS. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT EVERYTHING SPACESUITS, JUST GO TO NASA.GOV/SUITUP. WE’VE GOT A NICE REFERENCE THERE FOR ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF SPACESUITS, INCLUDING THE EMUs, MAINLY WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY. OTHERWISE, YOU CAN GO TO NASA.GOV/ISS TO LEARN ABOUT EVERYTHING GOING ON ABOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. AND JUST THIS PAST MONTH IN OCTOBER, WE HAD THREE SPACEWALKS, WHERE ASTRONAUTS WERE GOING OUT IN THE EMUs TO CONDUCT SPACEWALK AND MAINTENANCE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE STATION. YOU CAN ALSO FIND ALL THIS INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. SO JUST GO TO FACEBOOK, TWITTER, INSTAGRAM. YOU KNOW THIS, RIGHT? WE TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION ACCOUNTS ON WHATEVER SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM YOU LIKE-- FACEBOOK, TWITTER, INSTAGRAM. ON FACEBOOK, INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. ON TWITTER IT’S @SPACE_STATION AND INSTAGRAM IS @ISS. AND IN THE BEGINNING, YOU CAN SEE THAT ALLYOOP ACTUALLY SUGGESTED THE TOPIC FOR THIS EPISODE, AND WE’RE LISTENING TO EVERYTHING YOU HAVE TO SAY. SO JUST USE THE HASHTAG #ASKNASA ON  YOUR FAVORITE PLATFORM, AND SUBMIT AN IDEA FOR SOMETHING YOU’D LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT OR A QUESTION YOU’D LIKE TO ANSWER, OR MAYBE YOU’D LIKE TO FOCUS AN ENTIRE EPISODE ON ONE SPECIFIC TOPIC. SO WE’LL MAKE SURE TO LOOK AT THOSE IDEAS AND FIND THE RIGHT PERSON TO BRING ON THE SHOW. JUST MAKE SURE TO MENTION IT’S FOR HWHAP-- H-W-H-A-P-- “HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST.” THIS PODCAST WAS RECORDED ON APRIL 13, 2017. THANKS TO ALEX PERRYMAN, JOHN STOLL, AND MATT MACKENZIE. AND THANKS AGAIN TO LES PADILLA FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. WE’LL BE BACK NEXT WEEK.",

        description: ">> HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST. WELCOME TO THE OFFICIAL PODCAST OF THE NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, EPISODE 18: MARS. I’M GARY JORDAN AND I’LL BE YOUR HOST TODAY. SO THIS IS THE PODCAST WHERE WE BRING IN THE EXPERTS-- NASA SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, ASTRONAUTS-- BRING THEM RIGHT HERE ON THE SHOW AND TALK ABOUT ALL OF THE COOLEST PARTS ABOUT SPACE. SO TODAY WE’RE TALKING ABOUT MARS WITH DOUG ARCHER, WHICH I FEEL LIKE IS A GOOD TOPIC TO BRING UP NOW BECAUSE NEXT WEEK, NASA IS LAUNCHING A BRAND NEW PODCAST CALLED “GRAVITY ASSIST” HOSTED BY DR. JIM GREEN, NASA’S DIRECTOR OF PLANETARY SCIENCE. THE SHOW WILL FOCUS ON PLANETS, AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM, AND BEYOND. SO IF YOU LOVE PLANETARY SCIENCE, DEFINITELY SUBSCRIBE TO THAT SHOW. IT'S GOING TO START WITH A TEN PART SERIES ON OUR SOLAR SYSTEM THAT STARTS WITH THE SUN AND GOES ALL THE WAY OUT TO PLUTO AND BEYOND. I KNOW I’M PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT IT. SO AS SORT OF A TASTE OF WHAT YOU’RE GOING TO GET ON “GRAVITY ASSIST,” DOUG ARCHER WILL TALK ABOUT THE FOURTH PLANET FROM THE SUN TODAY ON “HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST.” DOUG IS A PLANETARY SCIENTIST AT THE NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER HERE IN HOUSTON, TEXAS. AND WE HAD A GREAT DISCUSSION ABOUT THE RED PLANET-- WHAT IT’S MADE OUT OF, WHAT IT’S LIKE ON THE SURFACE, AND WHY IT’S SUCH AN INTRIGUING PLACE FOR HUMANS TO VISIT IN THE NEXT GIANT LEAP. SO WITH NO FURTHER DELAY, LET’S GO LIGHT SPEED AND JUMP RIGHT AHEAD TO OUR TALK WITH DOCTOR DOUG ARCHER. ENJOY. [ MUSIC ] >> T MINUS FIVE SECONDS AND COUNTING-- MARK. [ INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ] >> HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST. [ MUSIC ] >> SO YOU’RE A PLANETARY SCIENTIST. THAT’S YOUR TITLE, RIGHT-- PLANETARY SCIENTIST? >> YEP. >> SO I’M GUESSING IT’S EXACTLY WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE-- YOU KNOW THE SCIENCE BEHIND WHY A PLANET IS THE WAY IT IS-- WHY IT’S A PLANET AND HOW IT WORKS AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF. YOUR SPECIALTY IS MARS. >> YEP, YEAH, I’VE BEEN WORKING ON MARS FOR ABOUT 13, 14 YEARS NOW. >> WOW. SO WHAT WAS IT THAT ORIGINALLY FASCINATED YOU WITH MARS? >> SO LIKE LOTS OF KIDS, WHEN I GREW UP I WAS INTERESTED IN SPACE OR BEING A PILOT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, OR AN ASTRONAUT. BUT THEN WHEN I WAS, I THINK, 16, I READ A BOOK CALLED “THE CASE FOR MARS: THE PLAN TO SETTLE THE RED PLANET AND WHY WE MUST.” AND IT WAS WRITTEN BY A GUY NAMED BOB ZUBRIN, AND HE LAID OUT THIS WHOLE ARCHITECTURE FOR HOW WE WOULD GET TO MARS, THE TYPE OF ROCKET THAT WE WOULD NEED, WHAT THE HABITATS WOULD LOOK LIKE, HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO GET THERE-- JUST THIS WHOLE ARCHITECTURE OF HOW WE WOULD GET TO MARS, AND THEN ULTIMATELY, THE LONG TERM GOAL IS TURNING MARS INTO A MORE EARTH-LIKE PLACE. BUT THAT’S LIKE THE SUPER LONG TERM GOAL. >> RIGHT. >> SO THIS BOOK CAME OUT, AGAIN, I THINK, IN 1996 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, AND THERE WAS THIS BIG COVER ARTICLE IN “NEWSWEEK” AND OTHER MAGAZINES-- IT KIND OF MADE BIG NEWS. AND I JUST READ THE ARTICLES, READ THE BOOK, AND JUST GOT FASCINATED WITH THE IDEA OF HUMAN EXPLORATION OF MARS, AND THEN LEARNED MORE ABOUT THE PLANET MARS. AND WHEN I WAS AN UNDERGRAD, I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT MAJOR I WANTED TO DO, WHAT I WANTED TO MAJOR IN, AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT, “WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK I’M KIND OF GOOD AT THIS, AND I’M KIND OF GOOD AT THIS.” BUT WHAT I WAS REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT WAS MARS AND MARS EXPLORATION. AND I DIDN’T KNOW HOW TO MAKE A CAREER OF THAT, BECAUSE WHERE I WENT TO UNDERGRAD AT BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY IN UTAH, WE DIDN’T HAVE ANY KIND OF SPACE RELATED PROGRAM THERE. SO I ENDED UP JUST MAJORING IN PHYSICS. I FOUND A PROFESSOR WHO WAS SIMILARLY INTERESTED IN MARS, AND ANOTHER PROFESSOR IN THE GEOLOGY DEPARTMENT WHO’D ACTUALLY-- >> AT BRIGHAM YOUNG? >> YEAH, AT BYU-- THERE JUST HAPPENED TO BE A FEW OTHER KIND OF SPACE ENTHUSIASTS THERE, MARS ENTHUSIASTS. SO THEY KIND OF POINTED ME ON THE ROAD, AND SO I TOOK AN INTRODUCTION TO PLANETARY GEOLOGY COURSE AS AN UNDERGRAD, AND JUST LOVED THAT. AND THEY POINTED ME ON THE COURSE OF, “ALL RIGHT, HERE’S SOME COURSES TO TAKE TO PREPARE FOR GRAD SCHOOL, AND THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD APPLY.” AND ONE OF THE PLACES THAT I APPLIED WAS THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA, WHICH HAS ONE OF THE FEW PROGRAMS IN PLANETARY SCIENCE IN THE COUNTRY, OR ONE OF THE FEW PHD PROGRAMS. AND I GOT ACCEPTED AND STARTED THERE IN AUGUST OF 2004. AND THE REASON THAT I WENT THERE IS THAT THEY HAD JUST WON THE CONTRACT FROM NASA TO DO THE 2007 MARS PHOENIX SCOUT MISSION. >> HUH. >> SO I GOT TO SEE-- SO I WENT IN, AND MY ADVISOR WAS THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR FOR THAT MISSION, SO KIND OF THE BOSS OVER THE WHOLE MISSION. SO I WENT IN AS A FIRST YEAR GRAD STUDENT AND WORKED ON THE PHOENIX PROJECT RIGHT AFTER IT HAD BEEN SELECTED. AND SO MY CAREER AS A GRAD STUDENT SPANNED THE RIGHT AFTER SELECTION, ALL OF THE DESIGN WORK, VERIFICATION, ALL OF THAT FOR PHOENIX, AND THEN LANDING, SURFACE OPERATIONS, AND THEN DOING THE SCIENCE ON THE STUFF THAT WE LEARNED ON THE SURFACE. AND THE MISSION ENDED IN LATE 2008. SO I JUST KIND OF WALKED INTO THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING INVOLVED IN AN ACTUAL MARS MISSION AS A GRADUATE STUDENT, AND JUST LOVED WORKING ON MARS, LOVED THE MISSION OPERATIONS ASPECT OF IT, AND ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING TIMES OF MY LIFE HAS BEEN THE TWO TIMES WHEN I’VE BEEN ABLE TO REMOTELY WITNESS A ROBOT LANDING ON MARS AND JUST THE ABSOLUTE THRILL THAT THAT IS THE 10 TO 15 MINUTES OF, OKAY, THIS IS IT. EVERYTHING COMES DOWN TO THIS MOMENT, AND THEN THE THRILL OF SEEING THE FIRST PICTURES FROM THESE LANDING SITES THAT NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. LIKE IT IS JUST AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING EXPERIENCE TO SEE THESE PICTURES COMING IN FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM ANOTHER PLANET AND JUST HAVING THAT FEELING OF DISCOVERY AND EXPLORATION. >> I CAN IMAGINE, BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUCH A PASSION FOR IT, SINCE YOU PURSUED IT SO FAR, GETTING A PHD. AND IN PLANETARY SCIENCE, BEING FASCINATED WITH PLANETS AND THEN BEING ABLE TO WORK ON AND LEARN FROM A ROBOT THAT WAS ACTUALLY ON THE SURFACE OF ANOTHER PLANET. >> YEAH. >> THAT IS CRAZY. THAT IS AWESOME. SO THAT MAKES ME THINK-- WHY-- SO YOUR SPECIALTY IS MARS, AND THAT IS A HUGE PART OF NASA’S JOURNEY TO MARS, RIGHT-- WE REALLY WANT TO PUT BOOTS ON THAT PLANET. >> YEAH. >> BUT WHY THAT PLANET? OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE VENUS, WE HAVE-- TITAN LOOKS PRETTY COOL, AND ENCELADUS. WHAT IS IT ABOUT MARS THAT’S SO INTRIGUING? >> SO AS FAR AS THE BOOTS-- IT ALL KIND OF COMES BACK DOWN TO THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND ASPECT THAT YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT. LIKE TITAN AND ENCELADUS ARE VERY INTERESTING PLACES, EUROPA-- THERE’S OTHER REALLY COOL PLACES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM, INCLUDING IF YOU’RE LOOKING FOR LIFE OUTSIDE OF EARTH. THERE’S OTHER PLACES THAT YOU COULD GO LOOK. MARS IS THE PLANET THAT IS THE MOST LIKELY TO HOST LIFE WHERE HUMANS CAN ACTUALLY GO. LIKE, WE ARE YEARS AND PROBABLY DECADES AND CENTURIES AWAY FROM BEING ABLE TO SAFELY GO TO ENCELADUS OR TITAN OR EUROPA OR WHATEVER WITH PEOPLE. >> THAT’S PRETTY FAR AWAY. >> YEAH, WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO GET US TO MARS, AND I THINK THAT IT IS-- WE KNOW THAT IN THE MARTIAN PAST MARS WAS A LOT MORE EARTH-LIKE THAN IT IS TODAY. WE DON’T EXACTLY KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENED. IT’S STILL AN OPEN QUESTION AS TO HOW MARS COULD HAVE SUSTAINED THIS WARMER CLIMATE, FOR VARIOUS REASONS THAT WE COULD GET INTO. >> YEAH. >> SO WE DON’T EXACTLY KNOW WHY THAT’S THE CASE, BUT WE KNOW FROM GEOLOGIC EVIDENCE THAT MARS WAS WARMER AND WETTER IN THE PAST THAN IT IS TODAY, AND WE KNOW FROM EARTH THAT PRETTY MUCH AS SOON AS LIFE COULD HAVE EXISTED ON EARTH, IT DID. SO WE DON’T KNOW HOW LIFE ORIGINATES, EXACTLY, BUT AGAIN, FROM EARTH WE SAY, HEY, AS SOON AS THE CONDITIONS WERE RIGHT FOR LIFE TO EXIST, WE FIND EVIDENCE OF LIFE. WE KNOW THAT THOSE SAME CONDITIONS EXISTED ON MARS, SO THE QUESTION IS CAN WE GO TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN FIND EVIDENCE OF A PAST-- MORE LIKELY PAST BUT POTENTIAL PRESENT LIFE ON MARS. AND THEN AS FAR AS THE ASTRONAUTS, THE ASTRONAUTS WILL ALLOW YOU TO DO A LOT MORE SCIENCE THAN ROBOTS WILL. >> RIGHT, BECAUSE IT-- I MEAN, SO WE TALKED ABOUT THIS ON A PREVIOUS EPISODE WITH BILL FOSTER ABOUT SPACE COMMUNICATION. >> OKAY. >> AND HOW DIFFICULT THAT’S GOING TO BE. IF YOU GET A SIGNAL TO MARS, IT’S GOING TO TAKE 8 MINUTES, UP TO 40 MINUTES ROUND TRIP TO DO ANYTHING. >> YEAH. >> BUT IF A HUMAN WAS THERE, THEY CAN MAKE DECISIONS RAPIDFIRE. >> YEAH. >> YOU CAN GET A LOT MORE DONE IN A SHORTER AMOUNT OF TIME. I’M GUESSING THAT’S LIKE PRETTY MUCH THE BASIS OF WHY HUMANS ARE THAT MUCH BETTER-- PROBABLY ALSO THE OBSERVATIONAL ASPECT OF IT. >> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY, BOTH OF THOSE THINGS TOGETHER. SO LET ME-- I’LL GIVE YOU AN ANECDOTE TO KIND OF SHOW YOU THE LIMITATIONS OF ROBOTIC EXPLORATION. AND FIRST I’LL SAY-- TALK ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF ROBOTIC EXPLORATION. FIRST OF ALL, IT’S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO TODAY, RIGHT-- WE’VE BEEN DOING IT ON MARS NOW FOR OVER 40 YEARS. THE VIKING LANDERS LANDED IN LATE 1976. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE OPERATING ROBOTS ON THE SURFACE OF MARS, AND THEY ARE VERY CAPABLE. LIKE, THE ROVERS CAN HOLD A LOT MORE STUFF THAN ASTRONAUTS CAN. THEY DON’T HAVE TO CONTINUALLY GO BACK TO THE THE HAB. YOU DON’T HAVE TO SEND FOOD. YOU DON’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT OXYGEN. >> RIGHT. >> SO IT’S A LOT SIMPLER. HOWEVER, ROBOTS ARE ONLY AS SMART AS THE HUMANS THAT PROGRAM THEM. >> RIGHT. >> AND BECAUSE WE HAVE NO CAPABILITY OF REPAIRING OR FIXING SOMETHING IF IT GOES WRONG, WE’RE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT HOW WE OPERATE THE ROVERS, OR ROBOTS. AND AS YOU SAID, WE HAVE THIS COMMUNICATION ISSUE BUILT IN THAT MAKES IT SO THAT-- YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT WHEN WE’RE OPERATING THE ROVERS ON MARS, IT’S A MAN OR A WOMAN SITTING IN A ROOM SOMEWHERE WITH A JOYSTICK IN FRONT OF A TV AND DRIVING THE ROVER. >> RIGHT. >> BUT AT ITS CLOSEST, MARS AND EARTH ARE-- THERE’S A FOUR-MINUTE ONE-WAY LIGHT TIME DELAY BETWEEN MARS AND EARTH, SO EIGHT MINUTES ROUND TRIP. AND AT THEIR FARTHEST AWAY, IT’S ABOUT 20 MINUTES ONE-WAY OR 40 MINUTES ROUND TRIP. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE, ANYTHING THAT YOU’RE SEEING IS DELAYED BY 40 MINUTES. SO THERE’S NO WAY-- IN THE WORST CASE-- 8 MINUTES, BEST CASE-- THERE’S NO WAY THAT YOU CAN DO ANY KIND OF REAL TIME OPERATIONS UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. SO WHAT WE DO IS WE PLAN A WHOLE DAY AT A TIME. SO DURING THE MARTIAN NIGHT WHEN THE ROVER IS ASLEEP, WE’RE AWAKE PLANNING THE NEXT DAY. AND WHEN THE ROVER WAKES UP, THE FIRST THING IT DOES IS KIND OF CHECK IN WITH EARTH AND GET THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR WHAT IT SHOULD BE DOING THAT DAY. AND THEN IT WILL GO THROUGH THE WHOLE DAY OF PLANNED OPERATIONS, AND THEN GO TO SLEEP, AND THEN THE PROCESS REPEATS-- WAKES UP-- AND SO IT SENDS BACK THE DATA OF WHAT IT DID THAT DAY, WE LOOK AT THE DATA OF WHAT IT DID, HOW THINGS WENT, AND THEN PLAN THE NEXT DAY. SO BECAUSE OF OUR CONSERVATISM, BECAUSE WE DON’T WANT TO BREAK ANYTHING, AND BECAUSE THE ROBOTS ARE ONLY AS SMART AS WE MAKE THEM, YOU’LL HAVE FUNNY INSTANCES WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE PHOENIX LANDER, WHICH WE KNEW HAD A VERY LIMITED LIFETIME BECAUSE IT WAS IN THE NORTHERN POLAR REGION-- SO AT SOME POINT, THE SUN WAS GOING TO SET AND NOT RISE AGAIN FOR SIX MONTHS. SO THERE’S NOTHING THAT WE COULD’VE DONE TO MAKE THAT MISSION LAST FOR YEARS. WE KNEW THAT GOING IN. >> BECAUSE-- HOW COLD DOES IT GET WHEN THE SUN SETS? >> WHEN THE SUN SETS FOR KIND OF MONTHS AT A TIME, I THINK IT CAN GET DOWN TO LIKE MINUS 130, WHICH IS THE FROST POINT FOR CARBON DIOXIDE. >> FAHRENHEIT? >> SO THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE-- CELSIUS, SORRY.  BUT AT THAT POINT, THEY’RE RELATIVELY SIMILAR. BUT SO THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE IS 95% CARBON DIOXIDE, AND IT GETS SO COLD THAT THE ATMOSPHERE STARTS CONDENSING OUT ONTO THE SURFACE AS DRY ICE. SO OUR LANDER, AT THE END OF THE MARTIAN NORTHERN WINTER, WAS BURIED UNDER A METER OF CARBON DIOXIDE ICE. >> OKAY, SO NO COMING BACK FROM THAT. >> YEAH. SO WE TOOK PICTURES WITH  HIGH RES-- A HIGH RESOLUTION CAMERA AROUND MARS, AND IT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THE SOLAR PANELS, WHICH IS KIND OF THE SIZE OF A KITCHEN TABLE ON THE LANDER-- IT HAD TWO PANELS ABOUT THAT SIZE, AND THEN A LANDER ITSELF THAT WAS ABOUT THE SAME SIZE. AND IT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THE SOLAR PANELS WAS BROKEN BY THAT. >> OH. >> SO WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS ALMOST NO CHANCE THAT WE WERE GOING TO SURVIVE TO THE NEXT YEAR. WE KNEW THAT GOING IN. >> BUT THE POLAR ICE CAPS ARE-- THEY’RE SUPER INTERESTING. THAT’S WHY YOU SENT IT THERE, RIGHT? >> SO WE WERE JUST SOUTH OF THE PERMANENT ICE CAPS, BUT-- SO THERE’S THE SEASONAL CAP OF CO2, AND THEN WATER ICE AS WELL. >> COOL. >> BUT THEN THE REASON WHY WE CHOSE THE LOCATION TO SEND PHOENIX IS THAT UNDERNEATH-- OR WE SAW FROM ORBIT THE SIGNATURE OF WATER UNDERNEATH SOIL. AND WE WENT TO CONFIRM THAT, AND WE DID, IN A FEW WAYS. ONE WAS JUST DURING THE LANDING PROCESS. OUR THRUSTERS THAT WE USE TO LAND SAFELY BLEW OFF THE COVERING OF THE SOIL OR LOOSE DIRT RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE THRUSTERS, AND YOU CAN SEE THIS ICE-CEMENTED GROUND. THEN WE HAD A ROBOTIC ARM TO DIG DOWN, AND FOUND THAT DEPENDING ON EXACTLY WHERE WE DUG, BETWEEN 4 AND 15 CENTIMETERS DEEP WE FOUND THIS ICE LAYER WHERE IN A COUPLE PLACES IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS ALMOST PURE WATER ICE. AND MOST OF THE AREA THAT WE UNCOVERED WAS ICE-CEMENTED SOIL. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE TAKING A DISH FULL OR DIRT, ADDING WATER TO IT, AND THROWING IT IN THE FREEZER. AND AT THESE TEMPERATURES OR AT THE MARTIAN TEMPERATURES THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER, IT’S AS HARD AS CONCRETE. >> REALLY HARD TO DIG, THEN, PROBABLY. >> YEAH, SO WE COULDN’T DIG INTO THAT. THE BEST WE COULD DO, WE COULD KIND OF SCRAPE ALONG THE SURFACE AND COLLECT WHAT WE SCRAPED. BUT WE ALSO HAD A DRILL THAT COULD DRILL ABOUT A CENTIMETER INTO THE ICE, AND THEN WE’D COLLECT THE TAILINGS THAT CAME FROM THE DRILL. >> OKAY. >> BUT TO GET BACK TO THE HUMAN EXPLORATION PLAN, SO ONE DAY ON MARS, WE’RE DIGGING WITH THE PHOENIX LANDER-- AND SO WHAT YOU DO, RIGHT, YOU SAY, “OKAY, DIG HERE, AND THEN DUMP HERE.” SO DIG IN THIS AREA THAT WE DEFINE, AND THEN DUMP OFF IN SOME OTHER AREA. >> ON THE SURFACE, RIGHT? NOT-- >> YEAH, ALL ON THE SURFACE. >> OKAY. >> SO THE ARM IS DIGGING, AND IT GOES TO DUMP, AND IT JUST SO HAPPENED TO CHOOSE A PATH BETWEEN THE DIG LOCATION AND THE DUMP LOCATION THAT THERE WAS A ROCK IN BETWEEN-- IT WASN’T A BIG ROCK. I MEAN, IT WAS MAYBE 8 TO 10 CENTIMETERS ACROSS-- NOT A HUGE ROCK. BUT SO ON LIKE THE VERY FIRST SCOOP-- AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE-- SUPPOSED TO SCOOP FOR A WHILE. ON THE VERY FIRST SCOOP, IT GRABS A SCOOP OF DIRT, HITS THE ROCK, AND JUST STOPS. BECAUSE IT DOESN’T KNOW WHAT TO DO, RIGHT? AND WE DIDN’T PROGRAM IT TO SAY, OKAY, WELL, IF YOU HIT A ROCK, THEN TRY THIS OTHER PATH. >> THE ONLY THING IT KNEW WAS OKAY, YOU GO FROM HERE, AND YOU GO TO HERE. IT WASN’T EXPECTING AN INTERRUPTION. >> YEAH, SO THAT’S THE KIND OF THING-- AND THEN YOU GO IN THE NEXT DAY AND YOU SEE THAT, WOW, THINGS DIDN’T GO AS PLANNED. WE ONLY HAD THIS ONE TINY LITTLE SCOOP. THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A WHOLE TRENCH THERE-- WHAT HAPPENED? AND YOU GO LOOK AT YOUR TELEMETRY AND SAY, “OH, WE HIT A ROCK.” AND IT WASN’T EVEN A VERY BIG ROCK. AND THAT’S THE KIND OF THING WHERE FOR A HUMAN, RIGHT, “OH, I HIT A ROCK. I’LL SLIGHTLY MOVE MY HAND AND GO AROUND THE ROCK.” AND YOU DON’T WASTE AN ENTIRE DAY FROM HITTING A SMALL ROCK. AND WE ENCOUNTER STUFF LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME, BECAUSE AGAIN, THE ROBOT’S ONLY AS SMART AS WE ARE. IF WE ENCOUNTER SOMETHING UNEXPECTED, THE CONSERVATIVE APPROACH IS USUALLY TO SAY, “OKAY, JUST STOP, AND WE’LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO TOMORROW.” SO A HUMAN DOESN’T HAVE THOSE KIND OF LIMITATIONS. AS YOU’RE SAYING, WE HAVE THE OBSERVATIONAL ABILITY TO FIRST OF ALL ANALYZE THE LANDSCAPE AND SAY, “THOSE LOOK LIKE THE MOST INTERESTING PLACES TO GO INVESTIGATE. LET’S GO THERE.” AND THEN YOU CAN GO DO THINGS VERY QUICKLY. AND SO THE PACE OF EXPLORATION WITH HUMANS CAN BE A LOT FASTER. NOW, THE COST IS ALSO A LOT HIGHER. >> SURE. >> SO YOU’VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT KIND OF WHAT’S YOUR SCIENCE RETURN PER DOLLAR. BUT THE PACE OF EXPLORATIONS WITH HUMANS CAN BE MUCH, MUCH FASTER. >> RIGHT. >> SO LIKE, AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE, THE CURIOSITY ROVER, THE MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY, WHICH HAS BEEN ON MARS NOW FOR ALMOST FIVE YEARS. >> WOW, THAT’S RIGHT. >> WE HAVE DRIVEN JUST OVER 16 KILOMETERS, WHICH IS A LONG WAYS, BUT FOR A HUMAN AND A HUMAN CLASS ROVER, THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE A GOOD DAY OR TWO OF DRIVING. >> RIGHT. >> NOW, YOU KNOW, WE’VE DONE A WHOLE LOT OF SCIENCE ALONG THE WAY, SO YOU CAN’T-- IT’S NOT JUST WE LANDED AND WE’VE BEEN DOING NOTHING BUT DRIVING. >> HIT THE GAS PEDAL AND JUST GO FOR-- >> FOR FIVE YEARS, YEAH. BUT JUST TO GIVE KIND OF A SENSE OF SCALE. I THINK WE-- THE OPPORTUNITY ROVER RELATIVELY RECENTLY SURPASSED HOW FAR THE APOLLO ASTRONAUTS HAD DRIVEN ON THE MOON. >> WOW. >> AND SO I THINK IT TOOK OPPORTUNITY OVER TEN YEARS WHAT THE APOLLO ASTRONAUTS DID IN LIKE THREE DAYS. >> RIGHT. >> SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE’S A SENSE OF-- THERE’S THIS DIFFERENCE IN SCALE OF KIND OF WHAT YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH, AND IT’S INTERESTING, THAT YOU’LL FIND THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH ROBOTIC EXPLORATION, ACTUALLY OPERATING THE ROVERS, MANY, MANY, MANY OF US ARE BIG PROPONENTS OF HUMAN EXPLORATION BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE LIMITATIONS, BECAUSE WE KNOW JUST HOW MUCH MORE WE COULD LEARN AND HOW MUCH MORE WE COULD DO WITH HUMANS THERE. >> YEAH. SO I’M GETTING-- SO AS A PLANETARY SCIENTIST-- I GUESS WE SHOULD’VE ADDRESSED THIS A WHILE AGO, BUT YOU-- DO YOU PICK THE LOCATIONS WHERE THE ROVERS ARE GOING TO GO? AND WHICH ROVERS ARE YOU KIND OF WORKING WITH NOW? ARE YOU WORKING WITH CURIOSITY? >> YEAH, SO RIGHT NOW, I’M WORKING WITH CURIOSITY. THE ONLY OTHER ROVER THAT’S CURRENTLY OPERATIONAL IS THE OPPORTUNITY ROVER. >> RIGHT. >> WHICH IS AMAZING. IT’S BEEN GOING FOR MORE THAN 13 YEARS NOW. >> YEAH, WAY PAST ITS EXPECTED-- >> YEAH, THE PRIME MISSION WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 90 DAYS. SO THEY’RE LIKE 4,000% OF LIFETIME OR SOMETHING-- I FORGET THE NUMBER. >> AWESOME. >> BUT MUCH, MUCH, MUCH LONGER THAN THEY EVER EXPECTED, WHICH IS JUST GREAT, AND A TESTAMENT TO THE ENGINEERS THAT BUILT THE ROVER. SO I WORK ON CURIOSITY, AND THE WAY THAT THE LANDING SITE SELECTION PROCESS WORKS IS IT’S ACTUALLY A FAIRLY DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. THEY’LL HAVE MULTIPLE MEETINGS FOR YEARS IN ADVANCE OF LAUNCH FOR SCIENTISTS TO COME, AND YOU CAN PROPOSE TO LAND WHEREVER YOU WANT. YOU CAN SAY-- WELL, OKAY, WITHIN REASON. SO THE ENGINEERS WILL SAY, “OKAY, FOR THIS LANDER IT NEEDS TO BE WITHIN 30 DEGREES OF THE EQUATOR, OR 45 DEGREES OF THE EQUATOR,” OR WHATEVER, AND YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FIT A LANDING ELLIPSE THAT’S THIS SIZE. AND SO THE LANDING ELLIPSE DEFINES-- IS THE AREA IN WHICH YOU ARE CONFIDENT YOUR LANDER IS GOING TO LAND. SO, SAY, FOR THE MER ROVERS, THE LANDING ELLIPSE WAS LIKE 100 KILOMETERS LONG AND -- I DON’T REMEMBER-- 15 KILOMETERS WIDE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO YOU’D HAVE TO SAY, “ALL RIGHT, YOU HAVE TO FIND A PLACE WHERE WE CAN SAFELY LAND ANYWHERE INSIDE OF A 100 KILOMETER LONG ELLIPSE BY 20 KILOMETERS WIDE. AND MSL, BECAUSE WE GOT BETTER AT GUIDANCE DURING ENTRY, THE LANDING ELLIPSE WAS ONLY LIKE 12 KILOMETERS LONG I THINK AND A FEW KILOMETERS WIDE. SO A FACTOR OF 10 IMPROVEMENT OVER WHAT WE’D DONE BEFORE, WHICH OPENED UP A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER LANDING SITES. >> BECAUSE NOW YOU DON’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THINGS BEING IN THE WAY. >> YEAH, YOU DON’T HAVE TO-- >> A HUNDRED KILOMETERS KIND OF ELLIPSE. >> YOU CAN PICK A LOT MORE INTERESTING PLACES BECAUSE YOU’RE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS ARE RELAXED FROM JUST KIND OF THE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY STANDPOINT. >> MM-HMM. >> BUT SO GIVEN THOSE RESTRICTIONS, YOU CAN PROPOSE ANYWHERE YOU WANT. >> MM-HMM. >> AND YOU CAN-- SO YOU’LL GO AND YOU ADVOCATE, YOU MAKE YOUR PRESENTATION, AND YOU ADVOCATE FOR THIS PARTICULAR SITE, AND WHY YOUR SITE IS BETTER THAN ANY OF THE OTHER ONES, THE QUESTIONS THAT WE’RE GOING TO ADDRESS BY LANDING THERE, WHY THIS SITE BEST MEETS NASA’S GOALS AND THE GOALS OF THE PLANETARY SCIENCE COMMUNITY. AND SO, I MEAN, I THINK THEY START OUT WITH A LIST OF LIKE 30 TO 50 LANDING SITES, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND OVER TIME IT’LL GET NARROWED DOWN TO USUALLY AROUND 3 OR 4. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THERE WILL KIND OF BE LIKE A COMMUNITY CONSENSUS AROUND, “THIS IS OUR TOP PICK.” SO THAT’S KIND OF THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF THINGS, BUT THEN ULTIMATELY THE DECISION IS MADE-- I’M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHO, BUT PROGRAM OFFICER LEVEL, NASA HEADQUARTER LEVEL, WHERE THEY’LL SAY-- BECAUSE SOMETIMES A SCIENTIST WILL PICK THINGS THAT ARE LIKE, “THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING, BUT IT’S A LITTLE BIT RISKIER THAN SOME OTHER SITE.” AND FOR THE SCIENTISTS WE SAY, “YEAH, WE WANT TO DO IT.” AND NASA HEADQUARTERS MIGHT COME IN AND SAY, “GUYS, IT’S A LOT MORE IMPORTANT FOR US TO LAND SAFELY THEN TO ANSWER THIS PARTICULAR QUESTION.” >> RIGHT. >> “SO WE’RE GOING TO CHOOSE THIS SITE.” >> OKAY. >> BUT FOR THE MOST PART, IT’S VERY DEMOCRATIC ABOUT BASICALLY ANYBODY WITH A GOOD IDEA CAN SUBMIT A CANDIDATE LANDING SITE, AND THEN IT GETS TALKED ABOUT IN THE COMMUNITY FOR YEARS. YOU ANALYZE IT FOR SAFETY. WE ACTUALLY USE OUR ORBITAL ASSETS THAT ARE AROUND MARS NOW TO TAKE A LOT OF PICTURES OF IT TO MAKE SURE FOR SAFETY REASONS THAT IT’S SAFE. LIKE, ANOTHER LITTLE ANECDOTE WITH PHOENIX WE HAD ONE-- WE HAD FOUR CANDIDATE LANDING SITES AND THE TOP, I’M ALMOST POSITIVE IF I’M REMEMBERING CORRECTLY, THE TOP-- WE HAD DECIDED ON ONE LANDING SITE OF, “OKAY, WE THINK THIS ONE’S GOING TO BE THE BEST.” AND THEN WE HAD THE HiRISE CAMERA GET TO MARS KIND OF RIGHT AT THE TAIL END OF THIS PROCESS. SO WE DIDN’T HAVE THE HIGH ENOUGH RESOLUTION-- WE DIDN’T HAVE AS HIGH A RESOLUTION PICTURES AS WE DO TODAY. SO HiRISE, ONE OF ITS TOP PRIORITIES WAS EVALUATING THESE PHOENIX-- POTENTIAL PHOENIX LANDING SITES. AND THIS ONE THAT WE HAD DECIDED WAS GOING TO BE OUR TOP SITE, THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR OF THE HiRISE IMAGE-- INSTRUMENT, WHICH IS ALSO BUILT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA, WHERE THE PHOENIX LANDER WAS. THE PIF HiRISE WAS A GOOD FRIEND WITH THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR OF PHOENIX AND HE SENT AN EMAIL WITH THE PICTURE OF THIS LANDING SITE AND IT WAS FILLED WITH MASSIVE BOULDERS. THERE WERE JUST BELOW THE LIMIT OF RESOLUTION OF THIS OTHER CAMERA AND IT WOULD’VE BEEN AN AWFUL, AWFUL PLACE TO LAND. SO AT THAT POINT, LIKE OKAY, ALL OF THE OTHER ARGUMENTS ARE THROWN OUT BECAUSE IT’S NOT SAFE. >> OH, YEAH. >> AND SO WE WENT TO I THINK PLAN B AND THEY IMAGED THAT ONE AND IT WAS LIKE, “YEAH, THAT ONE. THAT ONE LOOKS GOOD.” >> WOW. OKAY, THAT WOULD’VE BEEN-- YEAH. THAT WOULD’VE BEEN NOT GOOD. >>I MEAN, I THINK AS I RECALL, WE GOT THE IMAGE AROUND HALLOWEEN, SO HE SENT IT WITH THE CAPTION OF LIKE, “HAPPY HALLOWEEN.” AND THE WHOLE THING WAS LIKE SHADED RED OR ORANGE OR SOMETHING TO MAKE IT LOOK EVEN SCARIER THAN IT ACTUALLY WAS. >> WOW. >>  SO YEAH, AT THAT POINT WE KNEW, “OKAY, THAT’S NOT-- WE’RE NOT GOING TO LAND THERE. LET’S GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.” >> WOW. >> SO, I MEAN, THERE’S ROVERS ALL OVER THE PLACE, RIGHT? IT’S JUST YOU SAID WE’VE BEEN LANDING ON MARS SINCE THE LATE ‘70s, SINCE ‘76 I THINK YOU SAID WAS THE VIKING, RIGHT? >> YEAH. >> SO THERE’S A LOT OF INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT MARS. SO, I MEAN, MAIN QUESTION, RIGHT, SO IF YOU’RE LOOKING AT MARS AND YOU WANT TO KNOW, “OKAY, WHAT IS THIS PLANET? WHY IS IT SO INTERESTING?” >> UH-HUH. >> MAIN QUESTION: WHY IS IT THAT RED OR BURNT ORANGEY COLOR? >> YEAH. >> LIKE, WHAT IS THE OFFICIAL COLOR OF MARS? >> WELL, RED. >> RED. >> I MEAN, THAT’S ONE OF MARS’ NICKNAMES IS THE RED PLANET. >> RIGHT, OKAY. >> I MEAN, THAT’S WHEN I’M WRITING STUFF ABOUT MARS I WILL FREQUENTLY CALL IT THE RED PLANET JUST TO AVOID REPEATING MARS OR MARTIAN OVER AND OVER AGAIN. >> YEAH. >> SO MARS GETS ITS RED COLOR REALLY FROM ESSENTIALLY RUST. >> OH. >> SO YOU HAVE-- IN SOME PARTS THOUGH-- OR MANY PLACES ON MARS, IT’S INTERESTING, BUT IT’S REALLY ONLY SKIN DEEP THAT YOU CAN UNCOVER-- OR IF WE GO AND EITHER BRUSH OFF OR JUST BLOW AWAY SOME OF THE DUST YOU GET TO-- UNDERNEATH IT IT LOOKS A LOT DARKER. BUT WE HAVE THIS BRIGHT DUST DEPOSITS KIND OF ALL OVER NO MARS BECAUSE MARS CAN HAVE THESE GLOBAL DUST STORMS. SO YOU GET THIS STUFF DISTRIBUTED EVERYWHERE. >> WOW. >> AND THE RED COLOR REALLY COMES FROM THE OXIDIZED IRON, WHICH AGAIN, RUST, OR HEMATITE, THE SPECIFIC MINERAL OR OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT THAT GIVE MARS ITS RED COLOR. SO YOU HAD OXYGEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE, WHICH IS REACTING WITH MINERALS ON THE SURFACE TO PRODUCE THIS IRON OXIDE, WHICH GIVES MARS ITS RED COLOR. >> HUH. IS IT SHARP, THE DIRT? OR DO YOU CALL IT DIRT OR DO YOU CALL IT-- >> YEAH, SOIL OR-- WE’RE MOVING TOWARDS CALLING IT SOIL ON MARS. >> SOIL. >> EVEN THOUGH SOME TERRESTRIAL PEOPLE SAY, “UH, SOILS HAVE TO HAVE LIVING THINGS IN IT.” >> OKAY. >> BUT WE LIKE REGOLITH ON THE-- OR THE WHAT WE’RE CALLING SOIL ON MARS IS DIFFERENT FROM REGOLITH ON THE MOON OR OTHER AIRLESS BODIES. >> YEAH, OKAY. NICE. BUT THERE’S OXYGEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE. NOT A LOT THOUGH, RIGHT? LIKE YOU CAN’T STEP OUT ON MARS OUT OF YOUR-- IF YOU WERE TO LAND ON MARS AND STEP OUT OF YOUR CAPSULE AND BREATH THE FRESH AIR, RIGHT? THERE’S NOT A LOT. >> CORRECT. THERE IS-- SO MARS’ ATMOSPHERE IS 95% CARBON DIOXIDE, 2% NITROGEN, AND 2% ARGON, WITH-- SO THAT ONLY ADDS UP TO 99%. SO THEN THERE’S OTHER LITTLE BITS AND OXYGEN IS ONE OF THE OTHER LITTLE BITS, BUT IT’S MUCH, MUCH LESS THAN 1% OXYGEN. >> BUT IT’S ENOUGH TO RUST THE-- >> YEAH. >> MAKE THE SOIL-- >> WELL, AND THAT’S THE IDEA OF-- THAT’S WHERE AT SOME POINT IN THE PAST MARS’ ATMOSPHERE PROBABLY HAD MORE OXYGEN. >> RIGHT. >> AN DTHAT OXYGEN REACTED WITH WHAT’S ON THE SURFACE. >> OKAY, SO COMPARED TO EARTH, OUR EARTH IS MOSTLY LIKE NITROGEN, RIGHT, 70% NITROGEN AND THEN-- >> YEAH, 80%-- ROUGHLY 80% NITROGEN, 20% OXYGEN INSIDE OF THE-- >> OKAY, OKAY. SO ONLY 20%, THAT’S AWESOME. >> BUT SO THE OTHER THING THOUGH IS THERE’S-- YOU CAN’T-- NOT ENOUGH OXYGEN TO BREATH, BUT IT’S ALSO LESS THAN 1% OF THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE OF THE EARTH. SO REALLY LOW PRESSURE, NO OXYGEN. THERE’S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU COULD MEET A QUICK END ON MARS IF YOU JUST DECIDED TO STEP OUTSIDE WITHOUT ANY KIND OF PROTECTION. >> WHICH GOES TO OUR EARLIER POINT IS IF YOU WERE TO GO THERE YOU WOULD PROBABLY NEED A HABITAT, AND YOU WOULD NEED ROVERS, AND YOU NEED ALL KINDS OF SPACESUITS TO WALK AROUND. >> YUP. > YOU’D NEED ALL KINDS OF THINGS TO SURVIVE ON MARS, BUT-- I MEAN, MARS IS NOT JUST-- IT’S NOT JUST A BLANKET OF THE SOIL, THIS RED SOIL. IT’S GOT HILLS AND MOUNTAINS. IT’S GOT ONE OF THE BIGGEST-- >> IT HAS THE BIGGEST VOLCANO IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. >> THE BIGGEST VOLCANO IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM, RIGHT? SO, I MEAN, THERE HAS TO-- THERE WAS A PAST OF GEOLOGICAL ACTIVITY, RIGHT? >> YES. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF MARS, WE SEE A LOT OF EVIDENCE EARLY ON, LIKE I WAS SAYING EARLIER, THAT MARS WAS WARMER AND WETTER THAN IT IS TODAY. NOW, IT’S STILL AN OPEN DEBATE ABOUT HOW WARM IT IS AND HOW WET IT WAS, BUT WE KNOW THAT IT’S WARMER AND WETTER BECAUSE WE SEE EVIDENCE FOR RIVERS AND LAKES. >> MM-HMM. >> SO THERE WAS LIKELY AT THE VERY LEAST SNOW, POSSIBLY RAIN, BUT-- AND THESE-- I MEAN, THESE AREN’T LIKE LITTLE STREAMS. LARGE CHANNELS, HUGE LAKES. IT’S POSSIBLE THAT THERE WAS A MASSIVE OCEAN. SO WE KNOW THAT MARS WAS WARMER AND WETTER IN THE PAST, AND THEN KIND OF AFTER THAT MARS DRIES OUT, AND THEN YOU HAVE ALL THIS ABUNDANT EVIDENCE OF WHAT YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT, THE VOLCANIC ACTIVITY. REALLY, I MEAN, ALL OVER THE PLACE ON THE SURFACE IF THE PLANET THAT HAS REALLY KIND OF RESURFACED A LOT OF MARS. WE SEE-- WE STILL SEE A LOT OF CRATERS, BUT THERE’S VOLCANIC ACTIVITY ALL OVER THE PLACE, LIKE YOU SAID. SO WE HAVE OLYMPUS MONS, THAT’S LIKE 20 KILOMETERS HIGH, THE BIGGEST VOLCANO IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. >> SUPER BIG. >> SO MSL, OR THE CURIOSITY ROVER, LANDED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GALE CRATER, WHICH IS 150 KILOMETER WIDE CRATER THAT’S 5 KILOMETERS DEEP. AND RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CRATER IS A 5 KILOMETER HIGH MOUNTAIN. SO THAT’S-- I MEAN, THIS IS-- IT IS A MOUNTAIN. IT’S NOT A HILL. >> YEAH. >> IT IS HUGE. >> WOW. >> I MEAN, THIS IS-- IT’S LIKE RIVALS MOUNT RAINIER OR MOUNT SHASTA OR SOMETHING. LIKE, IT IS BIG. >> OKAY, YEAH. >> IT’S REALLY BIG. IT WOULD BE ONE OF THE LARGEST MOUNTAINS IN KIND OF THE LOWER 48 UNITED STATES. >> WOW. >> AND IT’S-- WE’RE STILL KIND OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW IT WAS FORMED. ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT IT IS THAT IT WAS-- IT WAS NOT FORMED BY-- SO, MOST MOUNTAINS ON THE EARTH ARE FORMED THROUGH PLATE TECTONICS, RIGHT? THE CONTINENTAL PLATES KIND OF CRASHING AGAINST EACH OTHER. OR A SUBDUCTION OF AN OCEANIC PLATE PUSHING UP MOUNTAINS AND THAT'S HOW WE GET MOUNTAINS ON THE EARTH. ON MARS, WE DON’T REALLY HAVE PLATE TECTONICS, SO YOU CAN FORM MOUNTAINS EITHER FROM VOLCANOES. THERE MIGHT BE SOME TECTONIC ACTIVITY, BUT WHAT WE’RE SEEING IN MOUNT SHARP IS LIKELY THE RESULT OF ACTUALLY THE CRATER, TO SOME DEGREE, FILLING UP WITH SEDIMENT, SO DIRT, ROCK, WHATEVER, AROUND A PRE-EXISTING CENTRAL PEAK IN THE CRATER THAT WE STILL SEE SOME EVIDENCE FOR. BUT WHAT THE MOUNTAIN THAT WE SEE IS MUCH, MUCH LARGER THAN THE CENTRAL PEAK WOULD’VE BEEN. AND THEN, ERODING AWAY INTO THE SHAPE THAT WE SEE TODAY. SO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FORM OF-- OR COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FORMATION MECHANISM FOR A MOUNTAIN. I DON’T-- I CAN’T THINK OF EXAMPLE OR ANY PLACE ON THE EARTH WHERE YOU WOULD EVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE THIS. >> WOW. >> BUT STILL, WE FORMED THIS 5 KILOMETER HIGH MOUNTAIN, AND THE COOL THING ABOUT IT THOUGH IS BECAUSE IT IS THIS COMPOSED OF SEDIMENTARY LAYERS THAT WERE LAID DOWN OVER HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS, AS WE DRIVE UP THE MOUNTAIN WE ARE SEEING DIFFERENT-- WE ARE SEEING DIFFERENT LAYERS AND WE GET A WINDOW INTO MARS’ GEOLOGIC PAST. SO WE COULD LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT WAS MARS’ ENVIRONMENT LIKE 3.5 BILLION YEARS AGO. AND THE REASON THAT WE PICKED THIS LOCATION IS THAT THE LOWER PART OF THE MOUNTAIN WAS CREATED WHEN MARS WAS WARMER AND WETTER AND THE UPPER PART WAS CREATED WHEN MARS WAS COLDER AND DRYER. SO WE’RE GOING TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DRIVE ACROSS THESE MATERIALS WHERE THAT SPANNED AGAIN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS OF GEOLOGIC TIME. >> YOU’RE KIND OF LIKE DRIVING THROUGH TIME, YEAH. >> WHERE MARS WENT UNDER THIS-- YEAH. WHEN MARS UNDERWENT THIS FUNDAMENTAL GEOLOGIC CHANGE-- OR CLIMATE CHANGE. SO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED. >> IT’S KIND OF LIKE-- SO I MEAN, I’M FROM PENNSYLVANIA, SO I REMEMBER DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AND SEEING THEY BLEW UP SOME OF THE ROCKS AND THEN YOU COULD SEE THE LAYERS OF THE ROCKS. >> YEAH. OH, YEAH, ROCK CUTS ARE GEOLOGISTS BEST FRIEND. >> YEAH. >> SO IT’S KIND OF LIKE, I MEAN, THE MOUNTAIN ITSELF ARE THOSE LAYERS OF ROCK AS YOU DRIVE UP. >> UH-HUH. >> IS-- I GUESS THAT WOULD BE A KIND OF A GOOD COMPARISON? >> YEAH, YEAH. IT’S JUST ON MARS IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO INTERPRET SOME OF IT BECAUSE OF THE EARTH-- AGAIN, THE MOUNTAIN, YOU HAD THE LAYERS-- SO YOU HAD THE LAYERS KIND OF LAID DOWN CREATING THE ROCK AND THEN YOU’LL HAVE THESE OTHER TECTONIC EVENTS THAT PUSH THEM UP. AND IN THE PROCESS, THINGS GET ALL KINDS OF JUMBLED. BUT ON MARS, THERE WAS NO TECTONISM SO THEY LAID-- THE ROCKS GOT LAID DOWN AND THEN THEY GET ERODED AWAY. BUT THERE’S NOTHING THAT HAS-- THAT WAS PUSHED UP FROM KILOMETERS DEEPER, OR YOU KNOW, OVERTURNED, CREATING ALL KINDS OF CONFUSION. SO IT’S-- IF WE CAN GET THERE TO THE RIGHT PLACES-- UNFORTUNATELY, ON MARS THERE IS NO ROAD CUTS SO WE HAVE TO DO WITH-- WE HAVE TO USE WHAT WE’RE GIVEN, BUT IT’S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU’D SEE IN A LOT OF PLACES ON THE EARTH. >> WOW. OKAY, SO ANOTHER MAIN DIFFERENCE, RIGHT, IS I GUESS, THE ATMOSPHERE. WE JUST HAD A RECENT DISCOVERY ABOUT HOW MARS’ ATMOSPHERE HAS CHANGED OVER TIME, RIGHT? >> UH-HUH. >> AND HOW-- WHAT’S THE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT LIKE ON THE SURFACE? >> SO YEAH, THE ATMOSPHERE-- SO THAT’S TWO THINGS. >> OKAY, OKAY. >> THE ATMOSPHERE, AGAIN, WE KNOW THAT IT WAS WARMER AND WETTER IN THE PAST SO THAT WE KNOW THAT THE ATMOSPHERE HAD TO BE A LOT THICKER THAN IT IS TODAY TO HOLD IN THAT HEAT. AND WE’RE, AGAIN, THOUGH WE’RE STILL UNCLEAR HOW MARS WAS ABLE TO BE AS WARM AND WET AS IT WAS. THERE IS SOMETHING-- SOME KIND OF MAGIC COMBINATION OF PRESSURE AND CHEMICAL ELEMENTS IN THE ATMOSPHERE THAT HAD TO OF EXISTED TO ALLOW MARS TO BE WARMER AND WETTER. AND THAT’S STILL SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE DEBATING TODAY. SO HOW THAT RELATES TO RADIATION IS THAT ON THE EARTH THERE’S A FEW THINGS THAT PROTECT US FROM THE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT IN SPACE. ONE IS EARTH HAS A MAGNETIC FIELD THAT DOES A LOT OF THE WORK. THE OTHER THING IS WE HAVE A RELATIVELY THICK ATMOSPHERE, SO ANYTHING THAT MAKES IT THROUGH THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS GENERALLY GOING TO GET STOPPED IN THE ATMOSPHERE. SO MARS DOESN’T HAVE EITHER OF THOSE THINGS. AND THERE’S OTHER TYPES OF RADIATION AS WELL, SO LIKE ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION, WHICH IS NOT GREAT FOR PEOPLE. EARTH HAS AN OZONE LAYER. MARS, DEPENDING ON THE SEASON, WILL HAVE A TINY BIT OF OZONE IN THE ATMOSPHERE, BUT NOT REALLY ENOUGH TO EFFECTIVELY SHIELD YOU FROM UV. SO YOU GET ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT DOWN TO THE SURFACE-- DOWN TO THE SURFACE OF MARS, WHICH ON THE EARTH WOULD BE STERILIZING. LIKE, IF YOU’RE--YOU STICK A BUG-- THAT’S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO ON EARTH TO STERILIZE WATER OR WHATEVER, YOU SHINE IT WITH UV LIGHT THAT MARS IS GETTING BATHED IN ALL THE TIME. >> OH. >> SO THE VERY SURFACE OF MARS IS NOT TERRIBLY HOSPITABLE TO LIFE. BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS, THE IRON OXIDES, FOR EXAMPLE, ARE VERY GOOD SUNSCREEN. SO IF YOU’RE UNDER A COUPLE OF MICRONS, SO LIKE A HUMAN HAIR’S WIDTH OF IRON OXIDE WILL DO A PRETTY GOOD JOB PROTECTING YOU FROM ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT. SO THAT’S ONE TYPE OF RADIATION. THE OTHER TYPE IS, AGAIN, THE KIND OF-- THE SPACE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU HAVE THESE HIGH ENERGY GALACTIC COSMIC RAYS AND STUFF THE SUN’S SHOOTING AT YOU ALL THE TIME. >> OH, YEAH. >> SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO BE-- FOR ROBOTS, IT’S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO BE AWARE OF AS WELL, BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO USE SPECIAL ELECTRONICS THAT ARE, LIKE, RADIATION HARDENED. FOR PEOPLE, YOU HAVE A COUPLE THINGS YOU NEED TO DO. ONE IS, YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF-- SOME KIND OF SHIELDING, AND THEN THE OTHER IS JUST KIND OF WHAT YOUR MISSION ARCHITECTURE IS. YOU WANT TO SPEND AS LITTLE TIME IN SPACE AS POSSIBLE. >> RIGHT. >> BUT I MEAN, WHAT I THINK, THERE’S A FEW THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO SHIELD YOU FROM RADIATION. LIKE RECENTLY-- WE HAVE A RADIATION DETECTOR ON CURIOSITY ON MARS. RELATIVELY RECENTLY WE WERE RIGHT UP NEXT TO A HILL DOING SOME SCIENCE AND THE COUNTS IN THE RADIATION DETECTOR WENT WAY DOWN. BECAUSE THIS RADIATION, IT’S NOT JUST COMING FROM THE SUN. IT’S COMING FROM EVERYWHERE IN THE SKY, BASICALLY UNIFORMLY. >> HUH. >> SO IF YOU CAN BLOCK OUT ANY PART OF THE SKY YOU’RE GOING TO LOWER YOUR RADIATION DOSAGE. SO IF YOU’RE AN ASTRONAUT YOU PROBABLY WANT TO BUILD YOUR HABITAT UP CLOSE TO A LITTLE HILL OR A MOUNTAIN AND MAYBE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT YOU DO WHEN YOU GET THERE OR YOU HAD ROBOTS DO THIS BEFORE YOU GOT THERE IS START FILLING UP SANDBAGS AND PUT IT ON THE ROOF ON YOUR HABITAT. BECAUSE YOU JUST NEED MORE MASS. THAT’S WHAT THE ATMOSPHERE IS. ON EARTH, IT’S JUST MORE MASS IN BETWEEN THE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT AND THE GROUND. SO YOU JUST NEED MORE MASS ON TOP OF YOU TO SHIELD YOU FROM THIS RADIATION. AND THEN, AGAIN, LIKE THE UV STUFF-- AN ASTRONAUT IN A SPACESUIT WILL BE JUST FINE. >> I’M IMAGINING LIKE IN “STAR WARS,” LIKE LUKE SKYWALKER’S HOUSE. HOW THEY JUST HAD THE BIG DOME MADE OF THE-- >> LITTLE DOME ON TATOOINE. >> YEAH, ON TATOOINE, MADE OF THE-- IT LOOKED LIKE SAND. >> YEAH. >> SO JUST LIKE MAKING LIKE A SAND DOME. >> YEAH, SO YOU NEED SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BECAUSE AGAIN, LIKE WHEN WE WENT TO THE MOON, THE LUNAR LANDER WAS-- I FORGET, BUT AS I RECALL, LIKE PAPER THIN, RIGHT. LIKE, IT WASN’T A LONG DURATION-- THEY WEREN’T PLANNING ON STAYING THERE FOR A LONG TIME. >> RIGHT. >> SO ON MARS, IF YOU’RE GOING TO STAY THERE FOR LIKE A YEAR AND A HALF, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE MISSION ARCHITECTURE SAYS ABOUT 6 MONTHS TRIP TO MARS TO GET TO MARS, A YEAR AND A HALF ON THE SURFACE, 6 MONTHS BACK. SO IF YOU’RE GOING TO SPEND A YEAR AND A HALF ON THE SURFACE OF MARS YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO SHIELD YOURSELF FROM RADIATION ONCE YOU GET THERE. >> DEFINITELY. SO IN THE MOVIE “THE MARTIAN” THERE WAS A SEVERE DUST STORM. >> YES. >> FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, THAT WOULDN’T REALLY HAPPEN, RIGHT? >> CORRECT. >> YEAH. >> AND THIS IS-- SO I GOT TO SAY THOUGH, BECAUSE NOT A KNOCK AGAINST ANDY WEIR AT ALL. >> YEAH. >> BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS AT JSC A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, HE GAVE A PRESENTATION AND SAID, “OKAY, BEFORE YOU GUYS ASK ANY QUESTIONS, I KNOW THAT THE DUST STORM WASN’T REALISTIC.” >> HE WAS PROBABLY VERY NERVOUS ABOUT HIS AUDIENCE. >> YEAH. >> HE’S LIKE, “THESE ARE THE GUYS THAT KNOW!” OH, NO. YEAH. >> YEAH, SO HE JUST SAID, “I WANTED TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT KIND OF LIKE “ROBINSON CRUSOE” ON MARS AND I HAD TO DO SOMETHING TO GET HIM STRANDED THERE.” >> RIGHT. >> SO THE DUST STORM IS NOT REALISTIC BECAUSE MARS’ ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE, AGAIN, IS LESS THAN 1% OF THE EARTH-- EARTH’S ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE. SO EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE VERY FAST WINDS THEY’RE NOT VERY STRONG. SO YOU COULD HAVE LIKE 100 MILE AND HOUR GUST AND IT’LL FEEL LIKE LESS-- A LESS THAN 10 MILE AN HOUR WIND ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH. SO IT’S JUST NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO PUSH ANYTHING OVER THAT SIZE. THE OTHER DIFFERENCE IS THEY’RE ARE DUST STORMS ON MARS AND THEY CAN BE PLANET ENCIRCLING, WHICH IS-- >> RIGHT, YEAH. YOU MENTIONED THAT BEFORE. >> YEAH, IT’S-- WHICH IS REALLY INTERESTING. SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY DOESN’T HAPPEN ON THE EARTH. >> RIGHT. >> THANKFULLY. >> YEAH. >> THE WAY THAT IT WORKS, AND YOU CAN GO LOOK AT-- THERE’S PICTURES OF THIS BECAUSE THE OPPORTUNITY ROVER HAS BEEN THERE DURING-- I DON’T THINK IT WAS A PLANET ENCIRCLING ONE, BUT AT LEAST A VERY REGION, LIKE LARGE SCALE DUST STORM. >> MM-HMM. >> AND THE WAY THAT IT LOOKS IS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DUST STORM YOU HAVE-- OR BEFORE THE DUST STORM STARTS YOU HAVE PRETTY CLEAR SKIES, AND THEN SOMETHING LIKE 20 TO 30 DAYS LATER YOU CAN’T EVEN SEE THE SUN AT ALL ANYMORE. IT JUST MAYBE GETS SLIGHTLY LIGHTER-- OR BRIGHTER DURING THE DAY. BUT IT’S A VERY GRADUAL INCREASE FROM DAY TO DAY. IT’S NOT LIKE IN “THE MARTIAN” THE “AH! HERE’S THIS MASSIVE DUST STORM BARRELING DOWN ON US. LET’S GET-- LET’S ALL GO INSIDE.” >> “IT’S TIPPING THE MAV!” YEAH, IT WAS LIKE-- >> YEAH, SO THAT WAS-- SO MARS DOES HAVE THESE REALLY LARGE DUST STORMS. >> RIGHT. >> BUT THEY’RE JUST NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO REALLY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MUCH. >> DOES IT HAVE IT’S OWN WEATHER, TOO? IT HAS LIKE LIGHTNING AND STUFF, RIGHT? >> YOU KNOW, I DON’T KNOW ABOUT LIGHTNING. IT MIGHT, I THINK. I DO KNOW OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE SAID THAT IT PROBABLY DOES HAVE LIGHTNING AND THE LIGHTNING COULD CREATE INTERESTING CHEMICALS THAT WE SEE IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND ON THE SURFACE, AND SO MAYBE THAT’S A SIGNATURE OF LIGHTNING. I DON’T KNOW THAT WE’VE EVER DIRECTLY OBSERVED LIGHTNING. >> MM-HMM. >> BUT MARS ABSOLUTELY HAS WEATHER. IT IS STILL A VERY DYNAMIC PLACE. THE MAIN AGENT OF CHANGE ON MARS IS WIND. IT JUST HAPPENS AT A SLOWER PACE THAN ON THE EARTH, BUT WE HAVE-- MARS HAS SAND DUNES THAT MARCH ACROSS THE SURFACE. IT HAS THIS DUST THAT CAN BLOW ALL OVER THE PLACE. MARS HAS DUST DEVIL, SO IF YOU LIVE IN A LITTLE BIT DRIER, MORE ARID ENVIRONMENT AND YOU SEE A-- AND YOU KNOW WHAT A DUST DEVIL IS, WE HAVE-- WE SEE DUST DEVILS ON MARS ALL THE TIME. >> AND THOSE THE TORNADO-- SAND TORNADOES? >> YEAH, THEY LOOK KIND OF LIKE LITTLE TORNADOES. YEAH. >> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. >> GOOD-- YEAH. SAND TORNADO IS A GOOD DESCRIPTION. AND WE’VE ACTUALLY BEEN LUCKY WITH SOME OF THOSE. SO SPIRIT AND OPPORTUNITY-- I KNOW THIS HAPPENED WITH OPPORTUNITY. I’M PRETTY SURE IT HAPPENED WITH BOTH OF THEM. SO THEY’RE SOLAR POWERED ROVERS SO THEY SAW THE OUTPUT FROM THEIR SOLAR PANELS WAS DECREASING OVER TIME BECAUSE YOU’RE CONSTANTLY GETTING DUST SETTLING OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE. AND THEN, SO THE-- I CAN’T REMEMBER THE EXACT NUMBERS, BUT IT HAD GONE DOWN TO LIKE HALF OF THE SOLAR PANEL OUTPUT FROM WHEN IT LANDED. AND THEN THEY LOOKED AT THE DATA AND FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEXT IT JUMPS BACK UP TO THE SAME AMOUNT OF POWER THEY WERE GETTING ON LIKE DAY 1 OF LANDING. AND SO THEY LOOK AT THEIR SOLAR PANELS AND THEY’D BEEN COMPLETELY CLEANED. >> OH. >> SO WHAT THEY THINK HAPPENED IS A DUST DEVIL PASSED DIRECTLY OVER THE ROVER AND DID US HUGE FAVOR BY CLEANING OFF THE SOLAR PANEL. IT’S LIKE THERE’S NO WAY THAT OPPORTUNITY WOULD STILL BE ALIVE HAD THAT NOT HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES. >> WOW. OKAY, SO THEY’RE PRETTY FREQUENT THEN IF THEY’RE-- >> YEAH. OH, YEAH. THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. >> WOW. >> AND LIKE I-- YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE DUST DEVIL TRACKS FROM SPACE. A FRIEND OF MINE, DAVE CHOI, DID SOME WORK ON THIS WHERE YOU CAN SEE DUST DEVIL TRACKS ALL OVER THE PLACE, BECAUSE WHAT I SAID EARLIER, YOU HAVE THIS BRIGHT RED DUST THAT GETS KIND OF LAID DOWN UNIFORMLY OVER THE SURFACE. >> MM-HMM. >> AND WHEN A DUST DEVIL COMES THROUGH IT’LL SUCK THAT UP OFF THE SURFACE AND MOVE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. SO YOU SEE THESE TRACKS OF DUST DEVILS ALL OVER THE PLACE. >> OH. >> AND AT FIRST WE DIDN’T REALLY KNOW WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT. AND THEN SOMEBODY, I FORGET WHO, SAID, “HEY, THOSE ARE DUST DEVIL TRACKS.” AND YEAH, THEY ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE ON MARS. WE HAVE SEEN THEM EVERYWHERE-- EVERYWHERE WE’VE BEEN LOOKING WE HAVE SEEN THEM. >> IT’S JUST AMAZING THAT YOU CAN THINK OF-- YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT’S GOING ON AT THE SURFACE LEVEL OF ANOTHER PLANET. >> YEAH. >> AS IF IT’S JUST LIKE ANOTHER PLACE ON EARTH, BUT WE’RE TALKING ABOUT ANOTHER-- >> ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLANET. >> YEAH, A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLANET. THAT IS WILD. >> YEAH. AND ANOTHER THING THAT PHOENIX SAW IS WE ACTUALLY SAW SNOW AND FROST DEPOSITION. I MEAN, IT WAS TEENY, TEENY, TINY BIT OF SNOW. >> RIGHT. >> BUT IT WAS SNOW, SO-- >> YEAH. IT’S KIND OF LIKE HOW IN-- I MEAN, LIKE I SAID, I’M FROM PENNSYLVANIA AND WE GET SNOW ALL THE TIME. BUT HERE, WHEN THERE’S SNOW EVERYONE LOSES THEIR MINDS. >> YES, YEAH. IT MIGHT BE-- WELL, SO IT MIGHT SNOW ON MARS MORE FREQUENTLY THAN IN HOUSTON. IT DOESN’T SNOW A LOT. >> OH, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SNOW ON MARS. THAT WOULD BE PRETTY COOL. SO I MEAN, BEING A PLANETARY SCIENTIST AND KIND OF-- I MEAN, YOU’VE ALLUDED TO A LOT, YOU KNOW, TALKING BOOTS ON THE GROUND, THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO, THIS IS WHAT HAVE TO THINK. >> UH-HUH. >> I’M ASSUMING YOU’VE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT WHAT A HUMAN MISSION TO MARS WOULD HAVE TO LOOK LIKE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. >> FROM A SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE? >> YES. >> OR A-- YEAH, SO I WOULD SAY PROBABLY THE HOLY GRAIL FROM A SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE-- AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HUMANS WOULD REALLY ENABLE WAS IT WOULD BE THE ABILITY TO DRILL. >> AH. >> BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE SAY-- ON MSO WE HAVE A DRILL AND THAT’S TRUE, BUT WE CAN DRILL DOWN ALL OF 6 CENTIMETERS. >> HMM. >> SO A COUPLE-- LIKE 3 INCHES, 2.5 INCHES, SO NOT VERY FAR. WE ARE LITERALLY JUST SCRATCHING THE SURFACE OF MARS. >> YEAH. >> AND IF YOU WANT TO GO TO A PLACE-- AGAIN, GETTING BACK TO THE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT, THE RADIATION-- YOU HAVE A LOT OF RADIATION OR ENERGY DEPOSITION IN THE TOP METER OF MARTIAN SOIL. >> MM-HMM. >> SO ANY LIFE THAT EXISTED THERE THAT WAS MAYBE BILLIONS OF YEARS OLD HAS BEEN EITHER HEAVILY TRANSFORMED OR COMPLETELY DESTROYED. SO IT WOULD BE REALLY HARD TO FIND THE SIGNATURE OF LIFE ANYWHERE WITHIN THE TOP METER. SO WE NEED TO GO DEEPER AND IF YOU WANT TO GO REALLY DEEP YOU NEED HUMANS. BECAUSE DRILLING IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO KIND OF IN AN AUTOMATED WAY EVEN ON THE EARTH. >> MM-HMM. >> YOU NEED PEOPLE THERE TO KIND OF TROUBLESHOOT WHEN THINGS GO WRONG AND FIX STUFF THAT BREAKS OR WHATEVER. SO THAT TO ME IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HUMANS WOULD DO. THE OTHER THING IS, I THINK WE HAVE-- WE’VE BEEN STUDYING MARS FROM THE SURFACE FOR 40 YEARS NOW, BUT STILL WE’VE ONLY LANDED IN-- LET’S SEE, WE HAVE VIKING LANDER 1 AND 2, PATHFINDER, MER, PHOENIX, MSL. SO 7 SUCCESSFUL LANDINGS ON THE SURFACE OF MARS. SO THAT’S LIKE SAYING PICK 7 PLACES ON EARTH, SPREAD OUT BY 1,000 MILES OR SO EACH, AND TELL ME ABOUT THE ENTIRE PLANET. AND OBVIOUSLY THAT’S NOT-- LIKE, THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE PLANET OVER 4.5 BILLION YEARS, AND BY THE WAY, YOU CAN ONLY GO ABOUT 10 KILOMETERS FROM WHEREVER YOU LAND. >> WOW. >> SO WE HAVE-- THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER PLACES ON MARS THAT WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. THAT YOU LOOK FROM ORBIT AND SAY, “WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED THERE?” >> YEAH. >> “WHAT IS THIS? WHAT’S GOING ON THERE?” AND THERE’S A LOT OF PLACES FROM ORBIT AS WELL WHERE SOME PLACES WE CAN KIND OF TELL SOMETHING ABOUT THE MINERALOGY. OTHER PLACES THERE ARE COMPLETELY COVERED IN DUST, SO WE REALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE MINERALOGY IS OF WHAT’S UNDERNEATH IT. SO ANOTHER THING THAT HUMANS WILL GIVE YOU IS THE ABILITY TO GO FARTHER FROM WHEREVER YOU’RE STARTING. AND AGAIN, THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND PEOPLE SAYING, “HEY, THIS LOOKS REALLY INTERESTING. LET’S CHASE THIS DOWN AND GO THERE.” ALSO, WE WOULD BE GREATLY BENEFITED BY BRINGING SAMPLES BACK FROM MARS ON PURPOSE WHERE WE KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM. >> RIGHT. >> LIKE, WE HAVE MARTIAN METEORITES, BUT WE DON’T REALLY KNOW WHERE THEY CAME FROM. >> MM-HMM. >> SO KNOWING THE CONTEXT OF THE SAMPLES AND BEING ABLE TO USE THE INSTRUMENTS THAT WE HAVE ON EARTH, WHICH ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE INSTRUMENTS THAT WE SEND TO MARS, BECAUSE OF SIZE, VOLUME, POWER, OR WHATEVER. WE COULD DO A LOT WITH A SAMPLE RETURNED FROM MARS AND ASTRONAUTS-- LIKE FROM THE MOON, ASTRONAUTS BROUGHT BACK HUNDREDS OF KILOGRAMS OF SAMPLES. >> MM-HMM. >> NOW, IT’S A BIT MORE EXPENSIVE TO GET BACK-- OR STUFF BAC FROM MARS. SO WE MIGHT NOT HAVE QUITE AS MANY SAMPLES, BUT WE WOULD HAVE-- WE’D BRING-- WE’D DEFINITELY BRING BACK SAMPLES WITH THE ASTRONAUTS. SO THAT’S ANOTHER THING THAT HAVING PEOPLE THERE ON THE GROUND ENABLE YOU TO DO. >> YEAH. KNOWING THE SCIENCE-- THIS WILL BE THE LAST QUESTION AND THEN WE’LL-- AND THEN WE’LL KIND OF WRAP UP. >> OKAY. >> BUT KNOWING THE SCIENCE OF THE PLANET, KIND OF WHAT ARE SOME OF THE KEY THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO BE PAYING ATTENTION FOR TO MAKE SURE THAT HUMANS CAN SURVIVE AND OPERATE IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY? BECAUSE LIKE YOU MENTIONED RADIATION A COUPLE TIMES. RADIATIO IS OBVIOUSLY A CONCERN, BUT WHAT DO WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE WAY WE MOVE AND HOW FAR WE CAN GO. >> YEAH. >> YOU OBVIOUSLY SAID YOU ALREADY TALKED ABOUT A MISSION PROFILE HOW LONG WE CAN BE THERE. >> RIGHT. SO YEAH, RADIATION IS ONE OF THE BIG ONES. WE’RE STILL NOT TOTALLY SURE HOW THE HUMAN BODY WORKS FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME IN A LOWER GRAVITY SITUATION. LIKE, WE HAVE PEOPLE IN ZERO G, RIGHT. >> RIGHT. >> BUT MARS IS 40% THE GRAVITY OF THE EARTH. WE DON’T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE EFFECTS ARE OF THE HUMAN BODY. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT’S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO SIMULATE, SO WE PROBABLY REALLY WON’T KNOW UNTIL WE GO. >> RIGHT. >> OTHERWISE, THOUGH, THERE ARE OTHER KIND OF ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS THAT YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF, LIKE YOU REFERRED TO THE DUST. SO THAT’S SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE GOOD FILTRATION SYSTEMS. >> OH, OKAY. >> IT’S-- ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS FOR THE DUST THOUGH IS FOR THE SUITS. LIKE, IF YOU HAVE A SPACESUIT WITH SEALS AND YOU HAVE JOINTS THAT MOVE, AND YOU HAVE DUST, GETTING INTO THOSE JOINTS, WHICH WE KNOW IT WILL. IT DID ON THE MOON. >> MM-HMM. >> THEN THAT CAN BE-- THAT CAN BE PROBLEMATIC. SO HOW DO YOU DESIGN YOUR SEALS? HOW MANY REPLACEMENT SEALS DO YOU NEED? OR DESIGN YOUR SPACESUIT TO BE REPAIRABLE BY THE ASTRONAUTS ON MARS. AND I MEAN, BUT THIS IS ALSO KIND OF AN OPEN QUESTION IS THAT WE DON’T REALLY KNOW THE NATURE OF MARTIAN DUST. WE DON’T KNOW IF IT WILL BE KIND OF AS SHARP AND DAMAGING AS SOME OF THE LUNAR DUST, BECAUSE THE LUNAR DUST AND MARS DUST FORM IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS. LIKE, WE KNOW THAT-- WE KNOW THE AVERAGE PARTICLE SIZE OF THE MARTIAN DUST THAT GETS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE IS LIKE 5 MICRONS, BUT-- SO THAT’S GREAT. IT’S GOOD TO KNOW THAT, BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE SIZE, SHAPE, HARDNESS, THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IN THE DUST ABOUT THE DUST WHEN YOU’RE TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT SEALS FOR SPACESUITS AND SPACECRAFT. THE OTHER THING IS BEING AWARE OF POTENTIAL TOXIC THINGS ON THE SURFACE, LIKE PERCHLORATE, FOR EXAMPLE, WHICH IS AN OXIDIZED CHLORINE THAT-- MOLECULE THAT THE PHOENIX LANDER DISCOVERED IN 2008. AND SO, WE KNOW THAT PERCHLORATE IS TOXIC TO PEOPLE. >> MM-HMM. >> BUT IN REALLY HIGH QUANTITIES. SO IT’S LESS OF A CONCERN FOR INHALATION FOR PEOPLE, HOWEVER MUCH PERCHLORATE MIGHT BE IN THE DUST. SO AS I LIKE TO TELL PEOPLE, AS LONG AS YOUR ASTRONAUTS ARE NOT EATING KILOGRAMS OF SOIL EVERY DAY THEY’RE FINE. BUT-- >> KILOGRAMS OF-- >> YEAH, IT REALLY WOULD HAVE TO BE-- >> THAT’S A LOT OF SOIL. >> YEAH, RIGHT. SO THAT’S GENERALLY FAIRLY LOW ON, “HEY, GUYS, DON’T EAT DIRT.” “YEAH, OKAY, WE GOT IT.” WE CHECKED THAT ONE OFF. >> VERY TEMPTING, BUT RESIST. >> YEAH, BUT SO THE ONE THING THAT WE DO HAVE TO-- WE DO HAVE TO DO MORE RESEARCH INTO IS THERE ARE-- IF YOU GROW PLANTS IN SOIL THAT HAVE PERCHLORATE THERE ARE SOME PLANTS THAT CAN CONCENTRATE PERCHLORATE IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE PLANET. SO YOU NEED TO KNOW, OKAY, IF WE’RE PLANNING ON LIVING OFF OF THIS, FIRST OF ALL, CAN IT GROW IN A SOIL THAT HAS PERCHLORATE? AND IF IT DOES, WHAT-- WHERE DOES THE PERCHLORATE GO? IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. >> MM-HMM. >> SO THESE ARE-- THOSE ARE KIND OF QUESTIONS THAT WE’RE ANSWERING. BUT THE EXCITING THING IS THAT WE HAVE THE DATA TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE QUESTIONS, RIGHT. >> YEAH. >> LIKE, I MEAN, 40 YEARS AGO AT THE END OF APOLLO WHEN WE TALKED-- FIRST TALKED ABOUT GOING ON TO MARS, WE DIDN’T KNOW ANY OF THIS STUFF. >> RIGHT. >> WE DIDN’T-- WE HARDLY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT MARS, BUT NOW WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE AND A LARGE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT THE SURFACE OF MARS IS LIKE. WHAT-- ALL THE STUFF WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY. WHAT IS THE WEATHER LIKE? WHAT’S THE TEMPERATURE? WHAT’S THE PRESSURE? WHAT’S THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION? WHAT’S THE MINERALOGY? WHAT ARE THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SOIL? IF YOU WANT TO BUILD SOMETHING THERE OR LAND SOMETHING  WHAT’S IT LIKE? WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT? AND THAT’S WHAT’S REALLY KIND OF AMAZING ABOUT THE JOURNEY TO MARS RIGHT NOW IS THAT REALLY, FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE HAVE THE INFORMATION TO GO OUT. AND WE KNOW THE QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO ANSWER. WE DON’T KNOW THE ANSWERS TO ALL THE QUESTIONS YET, BUT FOR THE MOST PART WE KNOW A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO ANSWER. >> MM-HMM. >> AND I’LL JUST ADD ONE FINAL THING SO YOU DON’T THINK THAT IT’S ALL BAD. THERE’S A LOT OF STUFF IN A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE’RE DOING ISN’T JUST WHAT ARE THE BAD THINGS ABOUT MARS, BUT WHAT’S ON MARS THAT WE CAN USE FOR HUMANS TO HELP ENABLE FUTURE EXPLORATION. >> HEY, YEAH. >> LIKE THERE’S AN INSTRUMENT CALLED MOXIE AND I’M SORRY THAT’S AN ACRONYM THAT I DON’T KNOW WHAT IT STANDS FOR. BUT BASICALLY, IT INGESTS ATMOSPHERE AND IT BREAKS THE CARBON DIOXIDE AND OXYGEN-- SO YOU’RE FORMING OXYGEN. OXYGEN WHICH THE IDEA IS YOU’D USE THAT FOR YOUR OXIDIZER IN ROCKET FUEL. >> NICE. >> AND YOU CAN ALSO-- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I’M DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN IS TRYING TO EXTRACT WATER OUT OF MARTIAN MATERIAL. SO WATER CAN BE REALLY USEFUL BECAUSE ASTRONAUTS NEED WATER TO DRINK FOR FOOD. YOU CAN BREAK THE WATER THROUGH ELECTROLYSIS OR OTHER WAYS INTO HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN. YOU CAN BREATH THE OXYGEN. HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN CAN BE USED AS ROCKET FUELS OR FUEL FOR A FUEL CELL. THERE’S ALL KINDS OF STUFF THAT YOU CAN DO JUST WITH WATER. >> MM-HMM. >> AND SO, EVERY KILOGRAM OF MATERIAL THAT WE DON’T HAVE TO BRING WITH US MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THAT WE WILL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GO BECAUSE IT LOWERS THE COST AND COMPLEXITY OF THE OVERALL MISSION. SO WE’RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT FROM WHAT’S ON-- WHAT IS ON MARS TODAY THAT WE CAN USE TO OUR ADVANTAGE. AND AGAIN, THIS IS-- THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT WE’RE NOW ABLE TO ANSWER BASED ON THE EXPLORATION WORK THAT WE’VE DONE OVER THE PAST 40 YEARS. >> THAT’S AWESOME. I’M EXCITED. I WANT TO GO TO MARS LIKE RIGHT NOW. >> ME, TOO. LET’S DO IT. >> THAT WAS A NICE LITTLE SUMMARY OF LIKE ALL THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT, TOO. THAT WAS GREAT. WELL, I THINK THAT’S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE. DOUG, THANKS FOR COMING ON THE SHOW TODAY. >> MY PLEASURE. >> THAT WAS AWESOME. SO COOL. I LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT MARS. I HAD SO MANY QUESTIONS AND LIKE ALMOST ALL OF THEM GOT ANSWERED. FOR THE LISTENERS, IF YOU DO WANT TO KNOW MORE, I’D BE SURPRISED, BUT ACTUALLY THERE ARE WAY MORE QUESTIONS. WE CAN TALK FOREVER ABOUT MARS. BUT IF YOU WANT TO STAY TUNED AFTER THE MUSIC THAT WE HAVE AT THE END HERE, WE’LL TALK TO ALL THE SITES YOU CAN GO TO AND LEARN MORE, AND MAYBE YOU’LL FIND A QUESTION THAT YOU WANT TO ASK AND WE’LL TELL YOU HOW TO SUBMIT THAT. SO THANKS AGAIN, DOUG, FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. >> YOU’RE WELCOME. >> WE’LL SEE YOU MAYBE NEXT TIME? MAYBE ONE MORE TIME, WHO KNOWS. >> SURE. [ MUSIC ] >> HOUSTON, GO AHEAD. >> I’M ON THE SPACE SHUTTLE. >> ROGER, ZERO-G AND I FEEL FINE. >> SHUTTLE HAS CLEARED THE TOWER. >> WE CAME IN PEACE FOR ALL MANKIND. >> IT’S ACTUALLY A HUGE HONOR TO BREAK THE RECORD LIKE THIS. >> NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY, BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD. >> HOUSTON, WELCOME TO SPACE. >> HEY, THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND. SO TODAY, WE TALKED ABOUT MARS, THE RED PLANET, AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. BUT WHEN I SAY EVERYTHING I DON’T TRULY MEAN EVERYTHING. OBVIOUSLY THERE’S A LOT MORE. WE MAY DO ANOTHER PODCAST IN THE FUTURE, BUT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE RED PLANET RIGHT NOW JUST GO TO NASA.GOV.

        title: 'Houston, We Have a Podcast. Episode 114: The Value of the Moon',
        description: "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, We Have a Podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center. This is Episode 114: “The Value of the Moon”. I'm Pat Ryan. On this podcast we talk with scientists, engineers, astronauts and other folks about their part in America's space exploration program. And today we're going to talk about the target of a lot of our current efforts: the Moon. NASA's Artemis program is focused on returning American astronauts to the Moon by 2024 through the use of the Space Launch System rocket, the Orion Spacecraft, the Gateway Lunar Outpost and a new lunar lander. And to do so in a sustainable way, that is to go to the Moon to stay, to learn how to support astronauts in that environment and in the process get ourselves ready to go on from there to Mars. As a part of that mission, we mean to make the best use of the natural resources on the Moon, and that's very different than what the Apollo program set out to do 50 years ago. It also prompts an echo of President Kennedy's question: why the Moon? Well today we're going to start scratching the surface of answering that question by talking to the self-described cheerleader-in-chief for the Moon. Dr. Samuel Lawrence is a planetary scientist in the Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science Division here at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. And he is the lead lunar exploration scientist at JSC. His research is focused on using petrology which is the study of rocks and the conditions under which they form. I know because I looked it up. His research is focused on using petrology and remote sensing to investigate the composition, origin and evolution of planetary surfaces. He's been heavily involved in the development and testing and the science operations of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter which is now ten years into studying the Moon up close. He is also busy in Project Artemis in the formulation of science objectives and operations for the next generation of exploration on the Moon. As they say, “we are going.” And today we talk about what we hope to do and to learn when we get there. Okay then. Here we go.  [ Music ]  Host: Let me start by helping to introduce the audience to who you are. Where does your interest in the Moon come from? Does it come out of the Apollo missions from 50 years ago or some other aspect of astronomy or geology?  Samuel Lawrence: Well, that's a very good question. Back when I started into graduate school in the 2000's, discovery of the potential microfossils in Meteorite ALH84001 was in the news and so like many people I actually went to graduate school to do Mars work.  Host: Yeah.  Samuel Lawrence: Mars. But I've always been interested in lunar exploration. Starting when I was a kid growing up, we had the space shuttle, had just started to fly. That's the reason why I'm here, and one of my earliest memories is watching Columbia launch on her first flight as STS-1. And so that's very inspirational. It has an effect on people. And keep in mind the space shuttle wasn't just -- at the time it was first launching, it was the tool that was going to open up the space frontier to the human species and we were all going to get a chance to ride in the space shuttle.  Host: You were going to go there, back and forth all the time.  Samuel Lawrence: We were going to go, yeah. I had a pamphlet that was put into a lot of Cheerios boxes when Columbia's first flights were going on. It was like, \"You will ride to work one day on a space shuttle.\" And you read that stuff and it does have an impact on you. And I think that actually did pull in a lot of young people in the early 1980's into the science, technology, engineering and math fields. So it does have, you know -- the space program does have a demonstrable impact on what young people choose to do with their careers. But again, during the 80's it was sort of assumed that we would all be -- you know, the 21st century was right around the corner. We would have moon bases and people on Mars. And the first President Bush hopped up there in 1988 and says, \"We're going to back to the Moon to stay and then on to Mars.\"  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: And so like most people, like most fourth-graders, when the president hops up there and says that, you might reasonably expect it's going to happen. And it's really kind of a shame it really didn't turn out the way we had been told. That is truly unfortunate because it does indicate something about our ability to make and follow long-term plans as a culture and as a society. But anyway, to answer your actual question, I'd always figured I would go to college to be an aerospace engineer. But I read -- you know, growing up in the 90's, you know, there was a lot of backing and forthing. And I read some op-eds by a guy named Paul Spudis and I was like, \"Wow, this makes really good sense.\" And so I was very excited about aerospace. I was going to go to college to be aerospace. And then I read a book by the legendary lunar geologist Don Wilhelms who did a lot of work during Apollo. And it was very interesting and I had this very epiphany that if you're really going to do space in the 21st century, then understanding where the resources are to enable human exploration is going to be a really important question.  Host: And you're talking about the resources that are out there in space.  Samuel Lawrence: Out there in space, that's right. Yes.  Host: Yeah.  Samuel Lawrence: And so I changed course slightly and became a geologist. And you know, geology's a very interesting field. It's very integrated. Any given day you might have to understand biology and physics and thermodynamics and chemistry in order to understand the history of rocks and how it worked on this planet. And in the book that Don Wilhelms wrote, “To a Rocky Moon,” he made the really cogent point that up until the space age, the Moon had been an object of fascination for astronomers. But the space program and the space race converted it into an object we could explore and understand using principles of terrestrial geology to understand how the Moon worked. And the great gift of Apollo was that it essentially opened up our understanding of the entire solar system and the universe around us in a way we could understand. And so when I went to college, I went -- or when I went to graduate school rather to get my doctorate in planetary science, I originally did it to do Mars work. And then I met -- and then I just sort of realized there was a lot of interesting stuff to be done on the Moon. And everyone else was doing Mars work, so I figured, I might as well just switch over to moon work and then I'll have less competition.  Host: Yeah.  Samuel Lawrence: Which proved to be an interesting choice.  Host: Have you been at NASA for your whole career?  Samuel Lawrence: No. No. I was hired three -- I was on the research faculty at Arizona State University and I was hired at Johnson Space Center three years ago specifically to shore up their lunar expertise in anticipation of a new program of lunar exploration.  Host: I read an article in getting ready for today that quoted you as saying the “Moon is the Rosetta Stone for the whole solar system.’’  Samuel Lawrence: That's actually true.  Host: That's pretty high praise.  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah.  Host: Tell me why you think that? What is it that we can learn studying the Moon that teaches us about the rest of the solar system?  Samuel Lawrence: Well, that is a very good question. So in general, when we went to the Moon the first time, we didn't really understand -- there were still major questions in the 60's about where did the Moon come from? There are these features on the lunar surface that look very much like rivers. And so there were people, serious scientists making serious suggestions there might have been liquid water on the Moon at one point. They look just like rivers. So they must be.  Host: Well if it's the evidence of your eyes and it's the only evidence you have.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. That's right. So then we went to the Moon and we discovered, as I sort of alluded to previously, that the Moon gave us this insight into planetary processes, the way geology works in other planets. And one of the reasons -- so we actually landed on one of things that looks like a river.  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: And discovered it was actually a lava channel and the Moon had never had liquid water on its surface and that the Moon was not just an asteroid that had been captured in lunar orbit. But we discovered that it was very similar to a rocky planet. It had a crust, a mantel and a core and it had very likely been created by a Mars-size impactor hitting the primordial earth and then the materials thrown off by that impact aggregated in low Earth orbit and differentiated into the Moon.  Host: It's formerly a piece of this planet.  Samuel Lawrence: Right. Which explains why the chemistries of the two bodies are so similar in some respects. They're very different in others. But in some respects they are actually pretty similar. And so but the biggest reason why I say that Moon is the Rosetta Stone of the solar system is we landed with astronauts who did field work in key locations on the lunar surface. From that field work -- they picked up samples, they did geology in the field, they selected -- they carefully selected samples, well more carefully in some cases than others. But they selected samples that were tied back to specific locations on the lunar surface. And from that we brought it back here to Houston and then distributed those samples all over the world and did radiometric age dating, figured out how old the samples were. And very similarly to -- you know when you cut down a tree you count the number of rings?  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: And that tells you how old the tree is. Well, on another planet, especially ones that don't have atmospheres, it's the number of craters that tells you -- they can be used to infer how old the surface is. The more craters there are, the older the surface is.  Host: The longer it's been there exposed to passing asteroids.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. That's right. And so there are always exceptions to every rule and that's sort of a gross oversimplification of it. But in general that rule holds. The older the surface, the more craters there are. So what you could do is you could count the areas near the Apollo landing sites, see how many craters are on those areas and then figure out because we have samples, the radiometric age dates, you know, see how old they were. And then that time scale has actually been extended to every single one of the inner terrestrial planets. Mercury, Mars, Vesta. And it really is this gift that has kept on giving. You can make a pretty good case in a sense it is actually what happened that most of the discoveries we've made in planetary science for the past five decades are directly or indirectly related to the discoveries made by the Apollo astronauts on the surface of the Moon. That was landing in six locations for only a few days at a time.  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: For over a two-year period. So imagine what's going to happen when we go back to stay. I cannot predict it. That's why you explore, right? But in general we do really need to go back to the Moon and get more samples and understand the radiometric age dates of other locations on the Moon. Because it sort of turned out that the Apollo -- the six Apollo landing sites and the Soviet landing sites were all actually in a very narrow band along the equator of the Moon and they're not actually truly representative of the Moon as a whole.  Host: Not distributed across, around the whole body.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. Yeah. So we do actually need to go back and get more samples and understand when things happened on the Moon. And that will actually help us to understand when things happened in all the other terrestrial planets too. So that's one of the key objectives for what we're going to do for future lunar missions as well.  Host: I must ask for everyone like me that doesn't know precisely what radiometric dating is.  Samuel Lawrence: Well, there are certain isotopes that decay over time. If you've -- I guess it's -- for those of us who grew up during the Cold War, it's probably an easier story to tell than others. But basically when a rock is erupted and forms onto a planetary body, it has certain elements that degrade naturally over time, radioactive decay. You can measure the abundances. And the way the decay rates are known. They've been measured in laboratories. You can measure the amount of these radionuclides in a rock and figure out based on what the abundances are how old the rock is.  Host: How long it's been deteriorating.  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah, that's right. How long the radioelements have been decaying over time. And then do math and figure it out.  Host: See, the math part is the hard part that keeps --  Samuel Lawrence: That's actually the easy part. It's the measurement that's the hard part, but sure.  Host: You've started to touch on some of the importance of the science of what we can learn at the Moon. We learned about the age of the planets from the Moon. How do you characterize generally -- and then we'll get more specific -- about the value of the science that we can get from going to the Moon?  Samuel Lawrence: Oh, it's immense. And the value you get from sending human explorers is going to be even larger. I think one of the key points I like to make which I sort of already have made is that we only landed on the Moon with human beings six times. And they only explored a very small, vanishingly small area of the lunar surface. And they had intense schedule pressure, intense time pressure. And you'll always have that in spaceflight. But if you're going back and our paradigm this time around is different. We're not going on camping trips. We're going to stay. And that means we're going to -- if you've listened -- so right now at NASA our focus right now is the 2024 landing, the Artemis III mission. But beyond, yeah, what comes after that, we're still working on it. It's still in development.  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: But the Space Council and the Vice President and the administrator have all been very clear we're going this time to stay and that requires a paradigm shift. It's not a camping expedition. We're going to go back and establish some sort of permanent presence on the lunar surface. And hopefully enable sustainable exploration in a way that doesn't -- you know, Apollo was fantastic but Apollo got cancelled and we don't want to have that happen again.  Host: And Apollo wasn't meant to go there to stay. Those missions were meant to go there for those short periods of time and come home.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right.  Host: It's not like it was their fault. But now we're doing something different.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right.  Host: We're going there to stay there to learn more about the place and to learn how we can stay there for a long time.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right.  Host: Long periods of time.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right.  Host: Are there certain aspects that you think of lunar science, if that's the right phrase to use, that are more valuable? What are the more valuable areas of science that we can learn about?  Samuel Lawrence: Well, I think there's a lot. Obviously there's -- in terms of understanding fundamental processes in the solar system, you know, the impact process. It affects every single planet in the solar system, not just the Moon. It affects Earth. That's why we're having this conversation, not, you know, some dinosaur radio show or something, right? I mean, that's why we're here.  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: So the impact process is fundamental. Understanding what exposure to the space environment does to a surface. Understanding the physics of how light interacts with the surface to understand how do you use remote sensing techniques to interpret mineralogy and composition. All of these are fundamental processes across the solar system, and the Moon is a natural laboratory for them. The Moon also records the first billion years of the history of the Earth/Moon system. So on earth we have plate tectonics and that tends to recycle, you know, the continents. You know, materials from the earliest part of earth when one-celled organisms were starting to crawl out from under the ground and get onto the surface and start the long evolutionary path that resulted in us -- that's all gone. We don't have that record on this planet anymore.  Host: Because it shuffled up the evidence.  Samuel Lawrence: Yes. Well, evidence was destroyed by plate tectonics.  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: But that evidence is there on the Moon. The Moon actually does record because it's the Earth/Moon system. It does -- the first billion years is available and can be found on the Moon. It's not saying you can say, \"Well, we're going to go to this spot and find it.\" But with a long-term presence on the lunar surface and lots of astronaut field work, you will find it eventually.  Host: Because there aren't plates and tectonics on the Moon.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. There's no plates. There's no tectonics. There's no recycling. You know, you will find it on the Moon and that's very interesting. That will tell us a lot about the rise -- you know, we're always talking about how to find life in the solar system, but how life evolved on Earth is a very, very important question for us. And a key part of that story is told on the Moon and only accessible there.  Host: It's not just the lack of plate tectonics. The Moon doesn't have weather or other things.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right.  Host: Or other things that would disturb the evidence of these ancient events.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right, yeah.  Host: Does the Moon have natural resources?  Samuel Lawrence: Well, that's one of the great discoveries we made during Apollo. So even before -- even before we started to understand the nature of the polar volatile deposits that everyone is talking about today, even during the Apollo missions we began to have an understanding that the Moon actually did have a lot of resources that could enable future human exploration. Jack Schmidt, the only geologist who ever flew to the Moon, sampled a thing called a pyroclastic deposit at the Apollo 17 site. And it turns out those are spread across the near side of the Moon. They have a uniform chemical composition. We can use simple chemistry to extract water and oxygen from these materials. They're large. And so this field -- we had, you know, lunar base concepts in the 80's that would have worked that used these deposits as the feedstock to sustain astronauts on the lunar surface. So you know, we've been thinking about this problem for a long time. And then in 1994, the Clementine mission was flown and that discovered the first tantalizing hints of potential water deposits or potential volatile deposits I should say at the lunar poles.  Host: You want to make the distinction between water deposits and volatile deposits?  Samuel Lawrence: Well, there's a perception out there that there are these skating rinks hidden in the lunar poles. And unfortunately or that is not in fact the case. Our lunar reconnaissance orbiter mission has shown that there is no observable skating rinks at the lunar poles.  Host: No big slabs of ice.  Samuel Lawrence: No big slabs of ice. But it has detected pretty conclusively -- and there was a mission called LCROSS, the Lunar Crater Remote Observation Sensing Satellite.  Host: Good for you.  Samuel Lawrence: It was co-manifested on the LRO launch in 2009 that impacted into Cabeus Crater on the Moon and discovered the unambiguous presence of water, H2O. And a lot of other possibly economically useful materials as well like methane. And the reason this works -- we sort of skipped a step there -- is that the Moon has a slightly tilted orbit. And so there are areas at the lunar poles where the sun both never stops shining or effectively, you know, where you have a lot of illumination, and where the sun never shines.  Host: And when you say tilted, you're saying -- is that in reference to --  Samuel Lawrence: To the sun.  Host: To the sun.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right.  Host: And the side of the Moon that we see is the same side all the time.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. Because the Moon is tidally locked. And there is no dark side of the Moon. This isn't an Isaac Asimov novel. There's a far side of the Moon which we never get to see, but it does get the same day/night cycle that the rest of the Moon does. But at the lunar poles, and this is why this is the target for the Artemis program, there are these areas of near-permanent illumination. And that has a couple of very positive effects. It means that the lunar night only lasts for something like 6-7 days at a stretch as opposed to 14 days. And you get 200-day periods each year where the sun never stops shining. And so it's a great spot to put down a stake hold and try to figure out how to live and work on other planets.  Host: Because you would have 200 days of sunlight to provide power?  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. And it's also a benign thermal environment. So on the moon there's this diurnal day/night cycle with an extreme of temperatures. And at the poles the swing is much less. It makes it easier to design habitats. It makes it easier to design systems to enable astronaut habitation on the surface.  Host: The change is less but still what's the temperature we're talking about? It's not an Earth kind of temperature.  Samuel Lawrence: It's equivalent to what you'd see on the International Space Station. So you're looking at around 200 degrees Fahrenheit in the daytime.  Host: Okay. So it's an environment that we already kind of know how to live in?  Samuel Lawrence: That's right.  Host: We're talking about natural resources. Are these natural resources -- it sounds like they would be useful to us in order to be able to go there and stay, as opposed to resources that are valuable that people would want to go and take away and sell somewhere.  Samuel Lawrence: It's very difficult to make the case that anything you mine in space is ever going to come back to Earth, for now. That could change in the future, but for right now the most near-term utility for lunar resources or any space resources -- and asteroids are chock full of useful things too, useful for people in space. So the things we're interested in are oxygen. Oxygen is rocket propellant, the stuff you breathe. We're interested in the possible, you know, volatiles which is hydroxyl, because that can be easily split off into oxygen and hydrogen which is rocket fuel. So there are -- you know, the near-term things --  Host: And the oxygen is water? Or the other way around?  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah.  Host: Yeah.  Samuel Lawrence: Yes.  Host: Yeah.  Samuel Lawrence: The water can easily be converted into oxygen and hydrogen.  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: So you know, we care about these things because oxygen is not only the stuff you breathe but it's oxidizer for rocket fuel. The hydrogen could also be rocket fuel. And so, like I said, the near-term thing is going to be focusing on enabling and making human exploration more sustainable. And the reason why is that it takes roughly six times -- there's a six-to-one gear ratio for getting stuff to the Moon, is sort of the lingo. And that's because for every pound you have to take to the lunar surface it takes roughly six pounds of fuel to get it there.  Host: Okay.  Samuel Lawrence: So give or take. So anything you can make on the lunar surface will eventually pay for itself, no matter how -- you know, and you always hear people talk about, \"Oh, you know, launch prices will go down eventually.\" Sure. Maybe. But it still doesn't change the fact you're still going to take six times as much fuel to get something to the lunar surface. So the more you can make on the Moon, the easier it will be to sustain a human presence there.  Host: The less you have to take.  Samuel Lawrence: The less you have to take.  Host: And the less of your resources here on Earth you have to expend for that portion of it.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. And also you have to learn how to live off the land if you're ever going to do Mars sustainably too. Because you're much, much farther away than, you know -- going to Mars is a much bigger technological leap and to really do it right, again, if you're going to do it in a way that doesn't eventually get cancelled, you want to have a sustainable presence on the Martian surface. You have to learn how to live off the land and use local resources. So it's an important paradigm shift and we can get started doing it on the Moon.  Host: You made reference to the lunar South Pole as a place where water, ice, has been found. Are there other of these valuable materials also in that same general region, making it a nice target for us to want to go to first?  Samuel Lawrence: I mean, what do you mean valuable materials?  Host: Well, the other natural resources.  Samuel Lawrence: Oh, other natural resources. Well, you can take lunar regolith and craft oxygen out of it pretty much anywhere on the Moon.  Host: And regolith is?  Samuel Lawrence: Lunar soil.  Host: Okay.  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah.  Host: And you can get oxygen out of the dirt?  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah. It's chemistry. You can do it. So you can -- some of the higher-grade resources are only found in equatorial regions of the Moon. So we'll have to -- like I said, this is a marathon, not a sprint. So we want to try to establish a beach head at the lunar South Pole and then eventually branch out to doing other missions to other places with gradually increasing capability. And that is why the Moon is very interesting, because it's not just an interesting scientific target. It's an interesting aspiration target. And we are not -- we don't just want to go to Moon and stay there. Going to the Moon actually gives you the capabilities you need to go anywhere you want in the solar system with any capability you might actually have.  Host: The things we can learn by going to the Moon and staying teach us.  Samuel Lawrence: And the workforce and technologies required to go back to the Moon will reenergize the aerospace industrial base and give us a body of knowledge which you know, I mean, has been lost or is on the verge of being lost. The Apollo generation is leaving us. No one alive, or very few people present at the agency today have designed a vehicle that's landed human beings on another world.  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: And so we actually need to relearn how to do stuff we once learned how to do.  Host: We've been talking for a few minutes about what there is on the Moon and it occurs to me to make sure I understand how we know that. I mean, we didn't -- it's been 50 -- almost 50 years since the last human beings went there and gathered up samples for us to bring back. But is that the primary way that we know about what's on the Moon? Or have we learned it from other things? And I'm thinking particularly of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter that you also worked on.  Samuel Lawrence: Right. Well, over the past two decades we've had a nice renaissance in lunar exploration. Because it's not -- yeah, like I said, the Moon is a very accessible target and so it's something we can actually get to relatively straightforwardly. And so we've had certain -- the Clementine mission which gave us our first global mineralogical maps of the Moon and the first tantalizing hints of polar volatile deposits. We've also had a series of international missions. So we've had our colleagues in India launch the Chandrayaan mission, Chandrayaan I. And you have Chandrayaan II on its way to the Moon right now. We have had the European Space Agency launch SMART I. Our colleagues in Japan launched the KAGUYA mission. And KAGUYA was a fantastic mission. It produced a tremendously valuable global dataset for mineralogy and composition and topography. Then we also finally had the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter which was launched in 2009 as the first step of the -- first actual mission launched as part of the vision for space exploration, President Bush's former program to return to the Moon and stay and go on to Mars. And so LRO really I think is an example of how you know -- how science can enable human exploration. The mission was an exploration mission, an ESMD, Exploration Systems Mission Directorate mission, but it was staffed by Science Mission Directorate scientists and it was expressly designed to collect the data needed to enable a program of lunar exploration. But along the way, it also produced fantastic paradigm-shifting science and reinforced the Moon's status as the cornerstone of planetary science. So it made a series of very important discoveries. Among them abundance of volatile deposits at the lunar polar regions, but also new details of lunar mineralogy, lunar chemistry, the lunar landforms we can see with LRO's camera system, land forms as small as a meter in diameter.  Host: Wow.  Samuel Lawrence: So we've discovered all kinds of interesting things about lunar geology and the physics of the impact process, and created a whole new set of places we really want to send astronauts and their robotic precursors. So ten years into the mission, we have fuel for six or seven more years of operations. It's my finest hope that we can actually have LRO still in orbit and taking images when the next American steps onto the surface are taken. That would be a nice shot.  Host: Overhead shot.  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah, that would be a nice symbolic closure of the mission.  Host: It would. I've wanted to set the stage for what there is there on the Moon to talk about what we would find when we go back. And part of your current portfolio is that you're working on developing the scientific objectives and the ways to do research during the Artemis missions that are coming up. It's still early in Artemis.  Samuel Lawrence: Still early.  Host: To the extent that you can, what's the outline of flights as we understand it so far?  Samuel Lawrence: Sure.  Host: What's the early plan?  Samuel Lawrence: Well, we had an exciting conference in January of 2018 called the Lunar Science for Landed Missions Workshop that went through and it was a great meeting and it went through -- it was sponsored by our friends at the Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute. And it was at the Ames Research Center. And that was a great meeting. It was the science community coming together and going, \"These are our high-priority targets for where we'd like to send precursor missions and also\" -- it was mainly focused on precursor missions, but all the stuff from that workshop is equally applicable to the human missions. So an inherent part of the Artemis concept is that we have this thing called the Lunar Discovery and Exploration Program. So part of that is going to be -- it's an exciting program. It's leveraging the power of American enterprise and American industry to create a whole new set of lunar landing vehicles and designs to carry payloads to the lunar surface. And as part of that program, or actually as part of LDEP we're going to be landing exciting new missions for science at various spots around the lunar surface. I don't know where they're going to be landing, but they've selected instruments and they've selected payloads and there's several contractors working right now to create new American lunar landing systems that will take US payloads to the lunar surface. So that's really exciting, and that's a key capability. Because as I mentioned previously it's been five decades since the United States landed a spacecraft on the lunar surface. So I view LDEP as a really important part of our lunar portfolio and I'm really looking forward to the discoveries those missions are going to make.  Host: And if I can, to be clear, the LDEP payloads are not humans down to the Moon.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right.  Host: These are research missions.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. But for this to work and work sustainably, we're going to have to have robots and humans working together. And I think that really does act as a force multiplier and it's going to make our exploration more effective and efficient and affordable when we can have regular cadence of missions going to the lunar surface. Because I could see scenarios where you are flying payloads designed to understand how to produce resources on the lunar surface to the moon on these LDEP payloads.  Host: If we're going to make use of those resources, we've got to have the tools to do it.  Samuel Lawrence: You've got to have the tools to do it. So I think it's a very good synergy between the mission directorates. It's a very exciting program. It's very innovative. It's going to be I think really exciting to see what American commerce can bring to the game in a way that is designed to enable innovation. And then moving on beyond LDEP which is our first missions as part of so-called Artemis umbrella are going to be LDEP missions.  Host: Okay.  Samuel Lawrence: In the early 2020's. And then we have the Artemis III and that's the first human mission as part of the Artemis program, presumably the seventh human lunar landing. And we have clear direction from above to land at the lunar South Pole which is a very interesting location. Like I said, there are -- it's an interesting environment that is enabling for future human exploration for long durations on the lunar surface. There's potential access to these volatile deposits which are not only interesting as a potential resource but are also interesting scientifically because it's that -- like I said, the first billion years of history. So we can go to these volatile deposits and presumably understand how organics and other cometary materials evolved over time in the solar system. That's an interesting thing scientifically. And there's also rocks we can pick up, and potential multiple -- potentially sampling multiple lunar terrains with access to the -- or excuse me, which could be accessed by landing at the South Pole. And by astronauts doing field work. So it's an interesting location. We're still working on some of the details here, but in general the idea is astronauts will land there and get out of the spacecraft, do space walks and make some very interesting new discoveries as they start to figure out what it's going to take to learn how to live and work on other planets.  Host: So if that's Artemis III, Artemis I and II and LDEP missions?  Samuel Lawrence: No, no.  Host: No? Okay.  Samuel Lawrence: Those are the missions formerly referred to as Exploration Mission I and Exploration Mission II on the space launch system.  Host: I see.  Samuel Lawrence: So those are Orion test flights in lunar space.  Host: Okay. And Artemis III gets the first humans back to the Moon?  Samuel Lawrence: That's right.  Host: And you made reference there, if I can -- there's a little exit ramp there. You were talking about doing exploration and finding evidence of the evolution of comets?  Samuel Lawrence: Well, sort of.  Host: Okay.  Samuel Lawrence: That was perhaps inelegantly phrased by me. What I'm alluding to here is again the Moon preserves its first billion years of history of the Earth/Moon system. And the reason why you have these polar volatile deposits is that again the Moon has these areas where the sun never shines. And when comets which are sort of wet, muddy ice balls hit the Moon, those volatiles during the lunar day/night cycle literally hop from one spot to another on the lunar surface. And eventually they get trapped in these cold traps at the poles. That process has presumably been going on for most of the history of the solar system. So by going to these volatile deposits in the lunar Polar Regions and studying them -- and we will get some of this data as we use these resource deposits for resources as we do resource extraction. As you start to really dig down into these deposits, you will get interesting information about how these volatile rich compounds, you know, water, methane, have involved over the complete four-billion-year history of the solar system.  Host: Because you will have had evidence of them from throughout that timeline.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. That's right. And we just went to the Moon and found it. And so it's going to be very interesting to see what develops out of this.  Host: How do they hop from one place to another on the Moon?  Samuel Lawrence: Boiling. So the water boils and then it gets so far -- some of it gets lost to the space environment, obviously.  Host: Okay.  Samuel Lawrence: Some of it lands when the sun goes down, and then the sun rises and the process repeats. And then eventually, so you know, from the giant ice ball that hit the Moon at the equator, a few molecules wind up in the lunar poles.  Host: It's dispersed.  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah. But they get trapped in the polar environment. That's a gross oversimplification. I'm sure some of my colleagues are cringing at the thought of it.  Host: Well, but you can imagine why when I heard it hops from one place to another that you had more clarification than that.  Samuel Lawrence: Indeed.  Host: So you talked about up to Artemis III and the first humans that would land by 2024. Are there plans for further human missions in that timeline beyond that?  Samuel Lawrence: Sure. I mean, the idea is --  Host: Do we know much yet?  Samuel Lawrence: A lot of this is still under development. But you've seen in some of the public talks given recently at the NASA advisory council and other places, there is essentially -- there are plans for other missions beyond 2024. So usually --  Host: Since we're going to stay.  Samuel Lawrence: Since we're going to stay, yes. So you've seen charts shown that show, you know, one mission a year in '25, '26, '27, '28 and continuing thereafter. So it should be interesting.  Host: Yeah.  Samuel Lawrence: As we establish this capability to do human planetary exploration.  Host: What would you say are both the immediate and the long-term goals of Artemis at the moment?  Samuel Lawrence: Well the long-term -- the immediate goal is to reestablish a credible capability to get human beings onto another planet. And you know, this, like I said, it's something we haven't done in a while. And if you're really going to be credible about saying, \"Yes, we can go to Mars or go to Sirius,\" or go to other places we want to go to, it makes sense to establish that capability in a place that's really only a few days away. Where you can take risks and have some confidence you might be able to get back to earth in a reasonable timeframe to preserve human life. The other -- there are other near-term objectives too. I mean, one of them besides reestablishing planetary exploration with human beings is understanding the lunar resource potential and understanding how to use it. Understanding how to incorporate that into human space flight architectures I think is a really key paradigm shift.  Host: Knowing more about what's actually there on the ground.  Samuel Lawrence: Knowing -- well, both. More about know what's actually there in the ground and providing ground trips, but also figuring out how to design systems that can leverage it once you find it there. Because again, you have to do that for just about anywhere else you want to go in the solar system.  Host: Sure.  Samuel Lawrence: So it's a key paradigm shift. And understanding how to, you know, refuel a spacecraft in microgravity or fractional gravity environments is a thing we've never -- don't have a lot of experience with. So we need to get some of that. Understanding and developing systems that can handle not just days on the lunar surface but months or even years of surface operations is critical for understanding, for enabling again longer journeys to Mars and beyond. So I think there's this whole host of technology development things that should and will come out of the Artemis program. There's scientific discoveries about the nature of the early Earth/Moon system, of fundamental planetary science processes. There's also things you can do on the Moon that aren't related to geology. There's interesting -- there's interesting things you can do from materials science. There's interesting scientific objectives for understanding the biological impacts of fractional gravity on human beings. Again, we have lots of data from ISS. We have lots of data at 1G on this planet.  Host: Yeah.  Samuel Lawrence: Very little between those two extremes. So having astronauts on the lunar surface for months or even years at a time or for weeks or months, possibly even years at a time will provide a critical data point for understanding what fractional gravity -- what the effects of fractional gravity are in human beings and possibly also developing coherent mitigation strategies for them. It is possible there is some number between zero and one where the deleterious effects of microgravity exposure are mitigated to some large degree. And that could be very useful for future exploration.  Host: I think it's very important that you point that out. Because a lot of times we, I think, maybe overlook the fact that the microgravity environment that we're learning about on the space station is not what you have on the Moon.  Samuel Lawrence: No. It's not what you have on Mars either. Yeah.  Host: There is gravity there. Not as much as Earth, but there is gravity.  Samuel Lawrence: There is gravity. And it turns out, you know, there are areas on the Moon, like I said, the far side is shielded. It never sees the near side. So there are interesting things you can do from radio astronomy, looking for the early cosmic dawn. There's teams of astronomers who are really excited about putting a radio telescope on the lunar far side. Again, with a field station on the lunar surface, permanent power production infrastructure, these kind of long-duration experiments become very possible. And the Moon I think will eventually become a platform very much like the ISS where you can use it for a variety of interesting things. And that's really exciting. You know, I can't -- it's difficult to predict the future. You know, always in motion, the future is. But once you establish the capability to access the Moon's surface on a regular basis, have infrastructure there to support long-duration experiments and activities, very exciting things are going to start happening. It's going to be very interesting to see.  Host: Set up on the far side of the Moon and able to look out in a way that we can't do from earth.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. Because it shields all the radio transmissions, right?  Host: Those coming from Earth?  Samuel Lawrence: Those coming from Earth. Earth is very noisy, but the far side of the moon is very quiet so you can actually do interesting radio astronomy from the lunar far side that is unique for the solar system.  Host: Talk a little bit about what kind of work we're doing now and work we need to be doing in the near-term future in order to support these goals of Artemis on the Moon.  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah, it's very interesting. So some of this work, you know, we've restarted it. It was quiescent for some time. So some of that work is slowly coming back to life as we realize we have to do this again. We're looking at where do you actually land? Where are the spots on the lunar surface that are safe that can be accessed by astronauts and robotic precursor missions? How do you account for, is there enough space to put landers down close together without having dust impingement on each other? So there's a lot of applied science research going on right now as we try to answer these questions in a way that makes sense and enables value to the taxpayer. We're working on the new space suits that will enable lunar missions. We're working on developing mobility systems that will let astronauts -- you know, like rovers that will let them go.  Host: Yeah.  Samuel Lawrence: From their lander and go out to do exploration, working on ISRU systems, in-situ resource utilization designed to use lunar resources and produce things of value to human explorers. We have American companies working on commercial landers right now to enable the goals of the Lunar Discovery and Exploration Program. So there's a lot of work which has all of the sudden come into very clear focus thanks to the challenge of the 2024 deadline.  Host: You've mentioned just then and earlier too about international and private or commercial participation in all of this. This is not just a NASA by itself effort, is it?  Samuel Lawrence: No. No, it's not. We have -- there's been for the last decade significant international interest in lunar exploration. And I think to paraphrase John Kennedy, you know, it's as true now as it was when he said it back in 1962 at Rice University. Whatever human beings undertake, free humans must fully share. There is a lot of international interest in the Moon. And I think, you know, it is incumbent upon the United States to lead the way back. And so I think there's a lot of -- I think there's going to be a lot of opportunities, good opportunities for our international partners to make meaningful contributions to the success of the program. All that is being worked on right now, so I would imagine there's a lot of excitement out there in the domestic United States community about a renewed emphasis on lunar exploration. And there's a lot of excitement from international partners about the United States finally committing to go back to the lunar surface.  Host: Well, the European Space Agency is already participating in the Orion Spacecraft.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right.  Host: But other national space agencies are I guess -- are they being encouraged to participate?  Samuel Lawrence: Yes, they're being strongly encouraged to participate and I think that would be most welcome.  Host: And you talked about in the LDEP missions, private companies are already working on some of these -- I don't know what the right way to put it is -- but science experiments that will be going and landing on the Moon on their own.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right, yes.  Host: As well as, you know, work has begun somewhere I'm sure on figuring out the actual mechanism of putting the human beings down on the Moon too.  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah, that's right. While that process -- there's already -- there was already a set of -- there was an action taken earlier this year. We call it on the inside appendix E which were essentially study contracts given to industry to study human lunar landing systems. And that's in progress right now.  Host: Before we get too far away from the mention of it, we were talking a minute ago about dust, moon dust. And one of the things that I learned a lot about during all the recent attention to the 50th anniversary of the first Moon landing was how much of a real problem the dust was in how it messes up our stuff that we bring there.  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah. That's actually true. But this is not -- so the dust is a problem. But keep in mind-  Host: I'm not saying that it can't be defeated, but it is one of the really -- one of the big things that people have to --   Samuel Lawrence: Yeah it is. It's something you're going to have to do anyway, no matter where you go in the solar system.  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: It turns out you find dust. So it's something we're going to have to address. And also keep in mind that most of the Apollo systems were designed in the early 1960's before we had any sense of what the lunar surface was like. So yes, they had a lot of problems during the Apollo missions. Some of that was caused by the fact they took good guesses, guesses that pretty much actually worked.  Host: Yeah.  Samuel Lawrence: We'd go to the Moon, we landed safely, we returned safely. We brought back 800 pounds of lunar rocks. But you know, most of those systems were designed well in advance of any realistic or actual knowledge of what the lunar surface was going to be like. So now that we have that knowledge, now that we fully understand the characteristics of the lunar environment, I'm actually pretty confident we can come up with engineering-based solutions to most of the dust issues that people are presently worried about. So I mean, it is something you have to worry about. It is something you pay attention to. But at the same time, we actually do know what the lunar environment is like and that will make I think all the difference in the world this time.  Host: Yeah. You're starting further ahead.  Samuel Lawrence: We're not starting from zero, yeah.  Host: As we did before.  Samuel Lawrence: Yeah.  Host: You've mentioned that a big part of the goal of the Artemis program is to return human beings to the Moon to stay, to create a sustainable presence. And we've talked about how we want to use the resources that we will find there in order to support this sustainable presence. Is a sustainable presence on the moon the same kind of thing -- or is it the same thing as a sustainable presence on Mars, which is the long, long-term goal of this?  Samuel Lawrence: Well, I would contend that the knowledge you get from going back to the Moon to establish a sustainable presence there will actually make a Mars mission happen a lot sooner. Because you have that workforce and industrial base recapitalized, I think it actually makes Mars missions more feasible, not less. It'll happen more quickly, not farther away. But that's common sense, right? Once you've done it on the Moon, it should be a lot easier to get the confidence back to go back to thinking about how to do Mars.  Host: You learn at least the general outlines of what you have to do. But there are going to be differences between the environments.  Samuel Lawrence: There will be key differences. Yeah, there are. But I would -- they are actually probably going to be pretty similar. I mean, if you look at the body of work that's been done recently for the -- there's been a lot of series of conferences and people have thought about this a lot. There's this concept of the Mars field station. And if you look at what that is, it's shockingly similar to what you might actually envision for a lunar field station too. So I guarantee you that establishing a sustainable presence on the lunar surface will buy down a significant amount of risk and develop a significant amount of industrial experience in how to create and fabricate habitats and have them be successful for the Martian experience. You know, there is a big difference -- it will shock you I'm sure to learn -- from going from a PowerPoint slide to actual hardware. [Laughter] And that is a gap we need to figure out how to jump to before we can start to really credibly talk about going to Mars with human beings. And you will do that on the Moon in a place where you can make mistakes and it's less bad.  Host: Yeah. It's exciting to be looking at really doing something like this, doing something that we did 50 years ago, but on steroids, in a different way. No?  Samuel Lawrence: It's different.  Host: Okay.  Samuel Lawrence: Again, 50 years ago we did camping trips.  Host: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: We have never established a permanent or semi-permanent, whatever you choose to call it -- I mean, humans won't be there the whole time. They'll be there some of the time. But we've never put down permanent human-tended infrastructure on another planet before, another world I should say. The Moon is not a planet. It's a world. But we've never done that before. It's new, it's exciting, it's a capability we have never had before, and I think people say, \"Oh, the Moon, we've been there, we've done that.\" No, we really haven't. We went there five decades ago. We landed in six spots and we only stayed there for a few days. When we go back, this time sustainably, this time to stay, that is something we have never done before. And it will accrue incredible value for the United States, for our allies and it will send a powerful message to the rest of the world of what we can do when we can put our minds to it. Because you see the moon with your naked eye. You can see it every day. No matter how dark the sky is, no matter how much pollution there is, no matter how much light pollution there is, you can still see the moon. And when you have Americans living and working on the surface of the Moon that sends a powerful message to the rest of the world about what we can accomplish.  Host: And that's exciting.  Samuel Lawrence: Yes, it is.  Host: I think that's exciting. This is not the first time that the United States has said we're going to return to the Moon and build on what we've learned from Apollo. What needs to happen so that Artemis can succeed where those previous efforts didn't?  Samuel Lawrence: Well, I think -- this is just me speaking personally. I'm not going to speak for the agency in this case. This is my perspective.  Host: What do you think is required for this effort to work?  Samuel Lawrence: I think we have to be very good stewards of US taxpayer dollars, more than anything else. They trust us. It is a special obligation and a special privilege to work for the American people. And I think when you go to them and say, \"We need your support to do something really exciting and provide value,\" it is incumbent upon us to make it work. It's up to us. So we have to say, here's the value proposition. These are all of the different ways. These are all of the different industries here in the United States we're going to be creating as part of this effort. Here's all the different ways we're going to enhance science, technology, engineering, medicine in this country. And here is the value proposition. It's up to us to sell it. You know, we have to be good stewards with taxpayer dollars, but in return we have to deliver. It's up to us. So that's my answer to that question. It is up to us. We have to deliver. We have to provide value. We have to do it in a way that is different and actually works this time. It is not sufficient to say we're going to do something and not do it. If we say we're going to do it, we have to do it. We have to deliver.  Host: Dr. Samuel Lawrence, thank you very much.   Samuel Lawrence: Yeah, you're very welcome.  [ Music ]  Host: If you listened to the first part of our “Heroes Behind the Heroes” series about recovering recordings of the Apollo 11 mission control team -- by the way its episode 88 posted on April 19th -- it's still there online if you didn't. Well, you know I tried to set the scene with some historical precedent for the attraction of exploring the Moon. And now I wish I had talked to Sam Lawrence too so I could have mixed in some delicious scientific reasons why bringing the Moon into our orbit in a symbolic sense was such a draw for folks back in the 1960's and for many still is today.

        description: ">> Houston, we have a Podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, episode one, International Space Station. I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. So, on this podcast, we'll be bringing in the experts-- NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts-- pretty much all the folks that have the coolest information, stuff you really want to know, right on the show and tell you more about all things NASA. We're talking everything from extraterrestrial dirt to the unknown parts of the universe. So, today, on the first episode ever, we're talking International Space Station with Dan Huot. He's the public affairs office for the space station program here at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas and we had a great discussion about what the International Space Station is, how it works, what it's made of, and why it's there. So, with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with Mr. Dan Huot. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  >> T minus five seconds and counting. Mark.  >> Here she goes.  >> Houston, we have a podcast.  [ Music ]  >> That's true. Very true. So, anyway, let's begin. I figured you're the perfect person to have here, being the public affairs officer of the International Space Station. You talk to scientists, astronauts, engineers constantly, so you're very aware of what's going on and everything about the space station. So, for those of you listening, I think this is a good opportunity to learn just everything about it. Right? So, start from the very beginning. What is it?  >> Everything. Awesome. Well, to start, in the beginning-- no. So, the space station is-- it's a giant spaceship. I mean it is-- it is the largest spacecraft that humans have ever built. And we haven't been flying in space for too long, relatively, I mean we've been up there for 50 or 60 years, but the space station is kind of the pinnacle for what we've built so far. It is massive. I mean this thing supports multiple people. It's been up there-- at least pieces of it-- since 1998. So, that's another one of those factoid alerts that we always like to tell people. If you were born after the year 1998-- spacecraft's always been up there, but if you were born after the year-- after November of 2000, as long as you've been alive, human beings have been living and working in space.  >> Wow.  >> We are aliens. We are a space-faring species. We are the ones off the planet. We've had people up there every single day for-- as of right now, over 16 years. I mean that is mind-blowing. And they're doing stuff every single day that's either going to impact us here on Earth or get us ready to go further out. I mean that is the purpose of the space station. That's why it's up there. That's why we have this huge thing floating above us.  >> So, you say stuff, we're doing stuff every day. Obviously, living up there I think is like a-- is a big part of it, right? We're-- like you said, we're explorers, we're space farers. What is the stuff that's actually, you know, that has that impact?  >> It's a lot of stuff. It's a lot of stuff. And I mean it is-- it is-- and it's divided up. It is as simple as just living in space. Just everything you do in space is a little bit different than the way you do it down here on Earth. I mean it could be anything from going to the bathroom to how you eat to just how you get your water. Everything is different.  >> So, it's like a way to practice, really, for--  >> It is.  >> For things further out. Because it's not really far up, right? It's only 250 miles. If you think about it, we're still in the Earth's protection. Like, we're still protected by the Earth's magnetic field.  >> Well, space is funny in that going up-- it feels like it's so far away, space, but it's 250 miles. That's not that far. I mean I feel like the city of Houston is 250 miles. It's not, but I mean 250 miles in a car is a short road trip, but 250 miles straight up, that's a rocket ride. That's a slightly different road trip, but it is-- it isn't that far away. I mean we still kind of are right on the doorstep. There's a really great quote in the paramount of space movies, Armageddon, where Owen Wilson says, you know, we're not even in outer space yet. This is just like the beginning. And that's kind of where the station is. It's in space, it's in what we call low Earth orbit. So, still pretty close. I mean they could get in a Soyuz spacecraft and be back on the ground inside of a couple hours. So, I mean you're still right on the doorstep. You're not really way out there yet, but it's getting us ready to go way out there.  >> Well, that's the whole-- so, NASA describes it as Earth-reliant, right? So, I kind of like the way they section it off, right, Earth-reliant means exactly what you said. Right? So, if something goes wrong, you can just hop in a spacecraft and be home in three hours and it's easy to get stuff there because it's only a-- I mean some Soyuz rides have been as little as six hours, right?  >> Relatively easy.  >> Relative--  >> Going to space is, yeah--  >> It's only rocket science.  >> Don't want to trivialize it. It's still-- and even-- that's-- I even have to admonish myself. It's still not easy to go to space. It's still-- I mean it is rocket science. It's literal rocket science, which is hugely complex and there's always inherent risk and all these other things, but when you start comparing it to, you know, going to Mars or our far-flung aspirations of spreading throughout the solar system and the galaxy and everything, when you compare it to that, it's, you know, doing hand quotes, easy. But it's still a monumental undertaking.  >> Yeah. And that's why-- so, we're doing that-- just like you said, in the future we want to go farther. Right? So, we want to go to Mars, we want to really just expand our presence in the solar system. So, the International Space Station is a great way to practice that. It's a good-- like you have a good understanding of what it takes to live in space, to operate in space, you could do a ton of science and learn how things interact and then, if you learn how things interact, you can design better systems to make them work better. I think one of the ones-- I think-- capillary action I think was a great one. Like the way that fluids move in space is kind of cool because they sort of like create a ball and there's no down, so if you're trying to design like a system that-- like a rocket system in order to propel fuel, you need to-- the fuel isn't going to go down, right, it kind of needs to have that sort of capillary action and a path to get there. Like little-- those little tiny things are things that make the huge difference in being able to kind of explore the solar system.  >> Well, it all comes to-- down to gravity and that's kind of the ultimate differentiator between why everything we do in outer space is different from the way we do it on Earth.  >> Totally.  >> Some of the stuff you touch on is very apt. I mean just moving fluids where, you know, here on Earth we almost take it for granted that everything settles towards the bottom. So, in plumbing systems and everything you can use that to your advantage. In space, you don't have that and that affects everything from moving rocket fuel to, you know, I'm an astronaut and I need to get a drink of water. Well, that system has to be specifically designed to work in the absence of gravity.  >> Yeah.  >> And we've had a lot of practice, you know, since we've been flying in space, since the 60's, but the station is really the first place you've had on this scale-- there have been space stations in the past, both from the U.S. and Russia, but the space station is really the modern cutting-edge test bed for just doing and learning everything about living in space. And so you have all of these different technologies that, like I said earlier, everything you do in space is different from the way you do it on planet Earth where, you know, you have oxygen, thanks to natural cycles. And you have trees scrubbing carbon dioxide from your atmosphere and producing oxygen back for you. You have water and lakes, reservoirs coming-- literally raining down on you from the sky, where in space none of that exists.  >> You have to create it.  >> You either have to bring it with you or find a way to create it.  >> Yeah.  >> And that's something that we're doing on the station right now, where you're trying to-- and that's one of those key-- we always talk about the different technologies that you need and technology is a really broad term, but one of the ones that is a lot probably easier to understand is how we get those things. How you get the water, how you get the air, just for the crew members. And one of the things you've got to remember is, again, so we're close to Earth right now, so we can launch water. We can launch air. We can launch all of these things to these crew members, but when they go to Mars, there's no resupply ship. There's no, you know, hey, the water tank's getting low, let's, you know, stop off here and tap it off. You can't do that. So, you've got to bring everything with you and everything is heavy. So, the more stuff you bring with you, the more fuel you need, the more expensive your mission, and then it just kind of compounds on and on and on and on and on. I'm going to ramble here for a while because I love this subject.  >> OK. Well, I'll kind of-- I'm not going to stop you, I'm going to kind of, like, redivert you. So, one of the things on the International Space Station they're doing now to do exactly that, so you said things are heavy, right, water. Water especially is very heavy.  >> Yes.  >> I forget the cost per pound to order-- in order to launch water.  >> Always varies.  >> Oh, it always-- OK, that's good to know. But I know the-- like, one way they're actually doing-- like, helping that out for long-duration missions is recycling. And the recycling system is just top notch. So good that they actually brought the technology back down to Earth and it actually is helping out third world countries with, you know, not access to any kind of clean drinking water. It's-- like the filtration system is that good. They drink their own urine and they capture sweat and stuff like that, right?  >> They do. And that's always a fun ew [phonetic] moment for little kids and stuff when you tell them that, but-- and there's the famous astronaut saying that yesterday's coffee is tomorrow's coffee. To where-- that's what you have to do when you have these weight limits and you're in this environment where, you know, outside your four metal walls is just a vacuum of nothingness. You have to find ways to conserve all of those things and we know very well here on planet Earth that conservation is a very important facet of life. They try to do it through recycling and any number of things. It's 10 times more important when you're in space and there is no, you know, corner store that you can run to and, you know, pick up some water.  >> The only things you have are the things you bring with you.  >> And so to recycle the water, they actually-- and they do, they collect water from all different sources, whether it's the astronauts' urine, which is a major source, their sweat, condensation in the cabin, any kind of wastewater gets fed through a treatment system which, you know, purifies the water and then puts it back out on the other side for them to continue to reuse. And the percentages seem to vary, but I mean we're reclaiming at least 85% of the astronauts' urine back into potable water. So, drinkable water. I mean that's incredible. And, as you alluded to, we've actually taken that water recycling technology and made it available and it's been used in disadvantaged areas of the world that don't have access to clean drinking water and so that's just a great example of here's a technology that we need for outer space, you know, we're trying to solve a problem off this world where we have the problem, and then we find a completely different use for this technology that it wasn't necessarily designed for. I mean our scientist didn't set out to develop a water filtration system for places without clean drinking water on Earth.  >> Right.  >> But it ended up having a use there and that's-- we call them spinoffs and that's-- you know, there's a lot of famous ones throughout NASA's history. That's just an example of one that came about with all the work being done on the space station.  >> Oh, yeah. You've heard of-- there's a lot of them, right? There's like-- memory foam is another one and like insulation for your house. Stuff like that. Like that-- all that stuff--  >> There's a lot and we produce something called Spinoffs Magazine where-- I mean it goes through just about every spinoff-- every technological spinoff that's come from space-based research that's used here on Earth. And that's just a symptom of doing research and development of this kind of funded research and development. People can find novel uses for technologies that were designed for one thing in a completely different field.  >> Totally. OK. So, let's take a step back and so we're talking about like all the experiments and like the reason that we're up there. Who's up there right now? So, you said like, you know, if you're 16-and-a-half, right, I think is the number-- if you're 16-and-a-half or younger, you've never lived in a time where people haven't been in space. How many people are in space right now?  >> Six.  >> Six. And it-- it's international, right? So, we got-- we have two Americans, right?  >> Yeah, so international is the first word in the name of the station.  >> Sure.  >> It's the International Space Station, so there's always an international crew up there. Right now, there's two Americans, Peggy Whitson and Shane Kimbrough, one French astronaut, Thomas Pesquet, and three Russian cosmonauts. And so you have crew members-- we've had crew members from-- and I'd have to look up the exact number, but I mean countries all over the glob have flown crew members on board the space station.  >> Oh, yeah. I want to say 18 I think is the number.  >> I think 18 is the latest and you've had well over 200 individuals travel to the space station and it is this global effort. You have 15 countries that are considered the main partnership, so these are the countries that signed all the papers and did everything back in the 90's to form this partnership and you have five main agencies. You have NASA here in the U.S., the Canadian Space Agency right to our north, European Space Agency, which actually incorporates a lot of different space agencies from all over Europe into one larger conglomeration. The Russian space agency, Roscosmos, and the Japanese space agency called JAXA, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.  >> Right.  >> And so lots of agencies, but all of this alphabet soup comes together to make the station possible and so everything that gets done just about is done in this big collaboration. So, you have these countries with drastic language barriers, cultural differences, sometimes governmental differences all working together on this massive multibillion-dollar piece, science research project.  >> I think it's fair to say that space exploration is really a global interest, right? I mean-- exploring the cosmos, it's not just a U.S. unique thing. It is really an international effort to make that possible.  >> It's something that will-- as it does now and will certainly in the future involve the human race, not just one country. I mean especially as we continue to expand upon what we've done on the International Space Station and we've even recognized that future missions, there's a lot of reasons to increase international collaboration, whether it's drawing on other countries' expertise, you know, one country's much better at doing one type of engineering than we are and vice versa or they have some kind of novel science. There's also the pooling of resources, which is-- can a lot of times be a major driver. Going to Mars, going to other places is going to be very expensive.  >> Yeah.  >> And so it makes a lot more sense to shoulder that burden across several countries who all have this kind of shared interest will probably have different main goals, which is true. It's even true on board the space station. Different agencies have different priorities for their research, but we all have that common goal of exploring space, improving the situation for people back here on Earth, and trying to push out further into the cosmos, into the galaxy, into, you know-- making Star Wars a reality. That kind of thing.  >> Well, Star Trek.  >> Or Star Trek, yeah. Star-- yeah, Star Trek is probably--  >> Star Wars, we don't need to fight.  >> Yeah.   >> See, when-- I think one of my favorite things really when you think about like global participation is the way that the modules were designed. So, like each of them were just given like specifications this is how it needs to be built and they built them all over the world and then launched them up into space and connected them for the first time in space. Really, everyone had to be working together constantly to make sure that actually happened. And then you have to launch into space, then you have to connect it in space, make sure it works, make sure all the systems are integrated. That's crazy.  >> It is. And, again, that comes back to you have these countries with, I mean, language barriers and just completely different ways of engineering and everything, but we built the station piece by piece in outer space. Like you just said, none of these things were connected on the ground the first time, so you better make sure that when you send it up to space it's going to-- like you didn't build a square peg for a round hole kind of thing.  >> Yeah.  >> So we had-- we-- there are definitely ways to share that knowledge, to share the technology, to make sure that all of your, you know, you can agree on standards, essentially, to make sure everything talks to each other, all the different electronics or all the different structural systems, all these different things. But it was still monumental to build this piece by piece. I mean it was literally done piece by piece. You had elements launched on either Russian proton rockets or carried up in the space shuttle where it would arrive, a big robotic arm would reach in and grab it out of the shuttle payload bay and then they'd attach it and you might have to do space walks and I mean unfurling solar arrays and all of these, you know, gigantic tasks. And it was done piece by piece by people talking and working together all over the planet. And there's really not another engineering project or even big project like that that exists.  >> I think it's-- it has been described as one of the greatest engineering feats in human history.  >> Not to toot our own horn, but we would certainly-- I would certainly argue that building a football-sized million-pound spacecraft in space is definitely up there.  >> Yeah. That is-- I-- yeah, I would rank it number one, but yeah, who am I to say, right?  >> We're biased.  >> A little bit biased.  >> We're a little biased.  >> So, OK, let's kind of think about like what it looks like, right, and how it operates. So, we talked about how you don't have access to-- you can't just walk outside or you can't drill for more resources. Everything has to be there, so it's got to have power, it's got to have air, it's got to have water, have all these things. So, let's-- power. Where does it get its main power?  >> The sun.  >> The sun.  >> Everything comes from the sun. It's incredible. And a lot of spacecraft do this because you have the sun. I mean the sun is-- we have solar energy here on Earth, but in outer space you can have even more direct access to the sun.  >> It's a very readily-available energy source in space.  >> That we know how to harness.  >> True.  >> We know how to make solar arrays and we have gigantic ones on board the station. So, every-- all the power on station is generated through solar energy. And we had talked about-- they see 16 sunrises and sunsets a day. So, about half the time, they're in complete darkness, so there is no sun. So, what you have is you have these great big solar arrays that are generating power and then there's a bunch of batteries on board and the solar arrays are just charging up those batteries for every time they slip behind the Earth again and they're in nighttime. Those batteries are just supplying power to everything, but it's 100% solar, renewable, clean sun energy.  >> Very true.  >> it's all solar energy.  >> And they're massive, right? Is it-- I think it's-- they actually-- they're so big and they produce so much power that actually they do have to like kind of get rid of some of that power because it's kind-- it's a little bit redundant, right? Just in case one of them breaks, like you still have enough power to power the whole thing.  >> You do have redundancy built in. Redundancy is one of our favorite words. Redundancy is a fancy word for back-up plan and at NASA we always-- you have back-up plans for your back-up plans. So, yeah, even if you lose-- we call them power channels-- if you lose one, you lose two, you can still power the majority of all of your systems on board. And even going beyond that, if you lose, you know, a much larger amount of power, you can still power your key systems and everything. You might just power down other things temporarily while you fix the problem. But it-- they generate pretty much a comparable amount to keep everything that we want on board and that's all the life support, that's keeping the lights on, that's running all of the experiments on board, all of the different hardware, just keeping the station, you know, oriented in the right attitude and flying it and any time-- I mean everything. Everything, everything, everything is powered by the solar arrays and it-- I mean it doesn't generate an overwhelming excess of energy by any means, because, again, you are spending a lot of time in darkness, so those batteries are getting used pretty much constantly.  >> Oh, yeah.  >> We're in the process of swapping the batteries. We're upgrading.  >> Yeah.  >> We've already upgraded one-fourth of them.  >> We switched out nickel hydrogen for lithium ion, right?  >> That is correct.  >> That's right. Lithium ion. They're way more efficient, right?  >> Yeah. But that-- I mean that's the power story. It's all solar energy through those big-- and they are very large and we come back to the football field, the American football field and now that--  >> We haven't clarified yet, have we?  >> That the solar arrays are basically-- each solar array is the size of an end zone and there are eight of those. Yes. That are the size of an end-- or--  >> Think like a pair of four of them, right?  >> Pair of four, so--  >> Yeah.  >> Four. It's tough because like one pair is actually two array blankets and-- but they're very large.  >> Yes. Yeah. OK. So, that's power, right? So, we already talked about water because you need to recycle water and make sure you have enough and water is very expensive to launch and if you recycle it it's a lot more efficient and it's very, very clean. So, what about air, right? We-- that's one thing-- you know, you think about like what a human needs-- shelter, water, food-- you don't really think about air because-- but it's something you definitely need in space.  >> That's-- again, that's something we kind of take for granted that air is just-- it's air. It's everywhere down here, but up there you're in a sealed environment. You're basically in a big sealed tin can and you need to fill that with air. So, they-- we can launch air, just like we can launch water. You can launch a tank of super pressurized air, usually in its liquid form, and then feed it into the atmosphere, but the main way we get it is from water. We use a system called the oxygen generation system that actually takes water, splits the atom-- not splits the atom, but splits the-- a water molecule into oxygen and hydrogen and then we can take that oxygen and pump it into the atmosphere. And they aren't in a pure oxygen atmosphere, so there's other stuff in there. There's a lot of nitrogen, so--  >> Very similar to Earth's atmosphere, right?  >> Yeah, they're basically in the exact same composition atmosphere that we have on Earth. And actually the same pressure too. So, there's no big difference there. That feeds into some of the stuff they have to do for space walks, but that's a completely different tangent I can go on. But-- so, we split the water molecules so then you have your oxygen which you can just feed directly back into the cabin and then you have hydrogen which you can vent overboard if you just build up a bunch of excess hydrogen or there's a process in a payload up there. It's used as more of a technology demonstration, so it's not really in the critical path, so it's not a critical piece that we have to have running at all times, but it's called the Sabatier. It uses the Sabatier process where you can take that hydrogen that you had left over from your water and then you can take the carbon dioxide that gets scrubbed out of the atmosphere by a different device, you split that carbon dioxide, you now have oxygen and then you have your leftover hydrogen. You combine those two and you've got more water.  >> Boom.  >> And so you can kind of build-- the ideal is to build-- we call it a closed loop. So, everything that gets put into this life support loop-- it's a big circle-- just constantly gets recycled. You've got your water, you drank your water, you recycle your water, you take some of that water and you turn it into air and oxygen, you take that excess hydrogen and you combine it with CO2 that the astronauts are breathing out and you make more water. And so it's all just kind of constantly going around in a circle and that way you get the absolute most out of everything you send up there.  >> That's crazy. You actually have to create an atmosphere, right, up there?  >> Yes.  >> It's not like Earth where it kind of does it for us. You actually have to make it work. That's crazy. I like the Sabatier system. That's cool. You said it was a technology demonstration. I thought it was like part of the whole thing because I know they called it a partially closed loop because, like you said, you can eject the hydrogen if you have too much, right, so it's-- but yeah, same-- kind of the same concept. So, OK, so they have air, they have water, they have power, they have all kinds of stuff. So, let's talk about like I-- the-- some of the experiments. I know one of the biggest one is the experiment on themselves, right? So, you-- in order to actually function beyond low Earth orbit and actually function in space, you have to learn how the human body reacts in space and what happens. So, I think the biggest thing-- maybe it's not the biggest thing, but it's definitely very important is bone loss and muscle degradation. Right? So, that is if you're in space for too long and you're just kind of floating around, your bones start to exhibit symptoms of osteoporosis and your muscles start to degrade. So, how do they counter that?  >> Yeah. Well, when we talk research, there's really-- there's kind of two different camps. There's the research that we're doing on board the station to get us ready to, you know, go on to Mars, explore the solar system, all of those other things, which is a lot of what you were just talking about, and then there's the research that has direct applications on Earth and we can dive into that too. That's research flown by commercial companies, by, you know, academia, taking advantage of this microgravity environment because we've seen there's a lot you can learn by taking gravity out of the equation. But, to the first camp, to the, you know, studying the people, the astronauts are guinea pigs kind of thing. The human body is an incredible machine and it's incredible at adapting to different environments. I mean that's both a gift and a curse because when you go into outer space-- I mean your vestibular system, so your sense of up is down, down is up, your balance, all of that goes all out of whack, but within about a day or two, most astronauts don't have the nausea anymore, their body is used to it already and they're able to live and work, which that's incredible. That's a great advantage to just getting into a new environment and hitting the ground running. The problem with that is when you get to an environment where you have gravity again, hitting the ground running can be very problematic because your body, when it's not-- when gravity is not pulling down on you-- so, you and I right now, I mean gravity is pushing down on you at all times and that builds up muscles in your hips and bones in your hips and that's why your legs are strong enough to just hold you upright because they're constantly fighting against that force. On places like the space station, that force disappears and so your body says, hmm, well, I don't need these muscles anymore, so it stops feeding nutrients to those and so you can actually-- astronauts will dispel-- so, in their urine they'll get raised levels of calcium because their bones aren't needing it as much because their bones aren't, you know, getting that much force just by existing.  >> They're getting rid of the calcium because you're right, it doesn't-- the body is saying you don't need this anymore.  >> And so understanding a lot of those processes is important because-- I mean if the astronauts were just going to stay in microgravity forever, not that big of a deal because their body just adapts and I mean they become space people. But astronauts come back to Earth. Astronauts will walk on Mars where there is gravity-- less gravity, but still gravity and you're going to need to walk around in a pretty heavy space suit and things like that. So, finding ways to counteract-- we call them countermeasures-- for all the ways the body adapts is-- it's something that we've been doing pretty much as long as we've been doing spaceflight, but we've really aggressively pursued it on board the space station. So, for example, bone loss and muscle loss. We've actually pretty much reversed for the most part all of the bone loss and muscle loss. You'll still see changes in bone density in some of the crew members, but a lot of them aren't losing that bone mass, that muscle mass that was such a problem in early long-duration spaceflight. And we do that through exercise. That is-- that is the main driver. There's exercise and there's nutrition, but exercise, the crew members are working out about two hours every single day. I don't know about you, but I don't work out two hours every single day.  >> Thirty minutes, I'm pretty much done.  >> Yeah. Even that can be hard for some people to find, but the crew members, two hours every single day and that's exercise both cardio and resistance. So, they have a number of devices up there. They have a treadmill, which, again, you need to remember everything-- and this is the running theme-- everything we do in microgravity is different. So, you can't just hop on a treadmill. You'll just float away and you'll just be pumping your legs in microgravity and that does nothing for you. So, the treadmill actually has a harness with basically bungee cables that pulls them down towards the treadmill so that way you're getting the force on your legs, you're actually exerting more force, and you can-- you can run. It's the closest you can get to just running in space. And I mean we've had astronauts run marathons on the treadmill and that's one of their key devices. They also have something called the advance resistive exercise device. I've stayed away from acronyms as much as possible--  >> You're doing a great job.  >> So far. But they inevitably come up. We call it ARED and it is-- it's their-- it's basically their home gym on board the station. Now, again, you can't just pick up a heavy weight and do some curls and, you know, get a workout.  >> Weight lifting makes no sense in microgravity, yeah.  >> There's microgravity-- so I mean they can-- they literally move several-hundred-pound modules and pieces of hardware all the time. And so, to help simulate weight lifting, it actually uses a series of pneumatic tubes to simulate force and they can actually simulate up to 600 pounds of force.  >> Nice.  >> Which some of the astronauts, their squat-- their squat number goes up when they're up there and it's slightly misleading because they're not squatting their own body weight like they are here on Earth.  >> Right. It's still 600 pounds. I don't think I could--  >> Well, I don't think any of them do 600 pounds, but they have the option if we ever get some powerlifters.  >> One day.  >> Up on board the station. And then they also have a stationary bicycle and then there's another treadmill. So, there's actually-- well, there's two treadmills on board the station, but-- I mean they use all of those two hours a day just-- and that's just to maintain that bone and muscle. And there's also ways you can help that process through nutrition. We're constantly looking is there a better way for them to work out, should they do-- I mean there is something-- there are research projects like Sprint where does it make sense for them to work out, you know, a lot harder but for shorter amount of time.  >> Like high intensity interval? Yeah.  >> Because two hours is a long time every single day.  >> Right.  >> That's a lot to ask. But, so--  >> And crew time is very valuable, right? Because they-- I mean you're talking about, like you said, 200-- I think it's 200 experiments per increment, right? And astronauts--  >> Two-hundred-and-fifty is the usual-- is the usual number. In like a six-month span, 250 experiments will happen on board the station.  >> That's crazy. So, yeah, crew time is very valuable and that's two hours gone every day from experiment time just to maintain bone and muscle mass.  >> Yeah.  >> Wow.  >> But I mean that's just one part of what changes when you're in microgravity.  >> Oh, yeah.  >> I mean there are-- they-- we-- your body actually has less blood in it by the time you come home. Your heart can change sizes because it doesn't work as hard to pump the blood. And then one of the big outstanding ones that we're still addressing is vision changes. And that's something that we knew about, but was never really considered a huge deal-- not a huge deal, but never really considered a major impact until within the last couple of years when we had a significant amount of astronauts returning from these really long stays in space and reporting that their vision was worse. And it's normal to come back to Earth and have a couple of changes that linger for a little while, but for these crew members, the vision never got better.  >> Wow.  >> And that's a concern. If you send somebody to Mars and in the nine months or however long it ends up taking to get there, all of the sudden they go from 20/20 to needing glasses to needing even stronger glasses that they don't have available and they land on Mars and they can't see, that's a big issue.  >> That's a big one.  >> And so we're trying to figure out exactly why this happens. There's a number of good ideas, good hypotheses. We think we know, but we're still doing a lot of tests to figure out exactly why it happens. And, just like the bone and muscle, how do we stop that from happening?  >> Hmm. So, you've got to find those countermeasures to make that happen. Wow, that's really intense. I mean imagine get-- like landing on Mars and you can't see anything.  >> It'd be kind of a buzzkill. Travel 60 million miles and get out and everything's blurry.  >> Yeah.  >> That wouldn't make me happy.  >> So, I know like when-- here's another thing. When astronauts-- so astronauts-- now they're doing-- on the International Space Station, pretty regularly they're doing long-duration increments, right? So, they're doing six months at a time.  >> Yes.  >> So, this is longer than any of the shuttle missions, a lot of the missions before it, and it's all to practice for missions beyond low Earth orbit. But when they come back to Earth, right, they generally-- right now they come back in a Soyuz, land in Kazakhstan and then we have recovery teams that go out and get them. But they have a hard time walking, right? When they first-- when they first get out.  >> Some do. And so that's part of, again, the human body reacting to the different environments. When astronauts first get into space, some will have nausea, some will have some adverse reactions to being in microgravity. The same is true when you're in microgravity for a really long time and you come back down to Earth. All of the sudden there's this huge weight pressing down on you that hasn't been there for the last six months or for however long you were in there. There's-- your inner ear goes crazy and like, oh, all the fluids pulling down again. Where am I? There used to be no up and down, but now all the sudden there's definitely a down and so it can be tough just to-- just to walk. I mean we-- we will-- we have teams that pretty much carry the astronauts out of the spacecraft and then on to a medical tent. So, we try to minimize any of that real discomfort and things like that for these crew members, but they are still test subjects and so we still do stuff to them.  >> Right.  >> And part of that is when-- let's say you're the first person to go to Mars. When you land, there's not going to be anybody there to pull you out of your capsule or help you set up camp.  >> Right.  >> Or anything like that.  >> I'm on my own.  >> You're on your own. And so we need to make sure before we send somebody how much can they do on their own. And we have these crew members coming back from extended periods in space and we have ability to test them. And now every astronaut is an incredibly gracious person because not-- a lot of this testing isn't glamorous and it can be--  >> You used the word guinea pig.  >> Uncomfortable-- they are guinea pigs in almost every sense of the word where they are subjecting themselves to pokes, prods, blood samples, all these different things--  >> For science.  >> For science.  >> Right.  >> For science! Yeah. But one of the things that we do-- and we started doing this in the last couple years-- is called the field test.  >> Right.  >> So, they'll come home. They'll land in the middle of Kazakhstan, pull them out of the capsule, and then we subject them to a series of-- they sound really simple, but it's just functional tests and it's things like walking a straight line, sitting down and standing up, laying down and standing up. Standing up and having somebody push you a little bit. It's all these things that, you know, that sounds-- that sounds really easy. Like, can I stand up? I can be an astronaut. Well, after spending six months in space, can be a little jarring. It can be a little difficult. And all of that feeds back into the research of, OK, I'm a Mars astronaut, I've been in space for, you know, six to nine months on this trip. I'm now in a gravity environment. You need to design the spacecraft, the habitat, everything to understand that, hey, for the first couple hours, this person might have to just sit in their chair and do nothing or, no, we can reasonably expect them to pop up and, you know, do these simple things. They might not be able to get out of their spacesuit for a couple of hours-- all of these different things have to be figured out before you just shove people into a spacecraft, kick them off the planet and send them somewhere else. But we're doing that. We're doing that right now.  >> Yeah. Man, their job is not done when they hit the ground.  >> Oh, no.  >> You're finally-- you know, after six months being away from home, you hit the ground and you're like ah, finally done, and then they make you stand up, sit down, do all kinds of crazy stuff.  >> And it doesn't stop there.  >> Oh, that's right.  >> And it's-- and, again, when I say they are truly gracious people, they have to sacrifice a lot for this. I mean, you know, obviously they get the great view and they're in outer space and that's amazing, but I mean just training for these missions is usually about two years. So, that's two years of you in intensive training, a lot of travel to all the other partner countries where they train you on different things, six months, so, you know, off the planet with you and just, you know, five of your closest friends, but away from all of your family, everything else happening in your life down here on Earth. You can't-- beyond a phone call and an email, you can't really interact with it. And then when they come home, we shove them in a tent and push them around and make them stand up and do all these other things and then fly them back and then the testing continues. I mean they keep giving samples. They keep doing eye exams. Scott Kelly landed in his one-year mission a little over a year ago. He was just here doing more tests.  >> Right.  >> I mean it is a real commitment on behalf of these astronauts to do these flights in space. But, again, what they're doing is going to help future astronauts, it's going to help future explorers, I mean everybody down the line will benefit from the work that they're doing.  >> That's right. You have a diverse crew of-- or astronaut class, I guess. All the astronauts, they-- you've got all kinds of different people and they all do the same thing. So, you-- so the more that you do, the more you really have an understanding of what's going to happen-- in general, like on average-- I mean it's like a big sample size. Right? So, when you're doing an experiment, you just keep doing the experiments and big sample size and you can learn a lot.  >> Yeah. And any researcher will tell you that you need more subjects. You need as many subjects as you can. They always want more people. The more the better, the better the results you can get and it's a good point when you say, like, they're diverse. They are-- where if you think the early days of astronauts, it was, you know, all male test pilots. That's all-- that's all it was.  >> Right.  >> Now you still have, you know, a lot of military astronauts, but it's a much more heterogeneous mixture. There's a lot of different parts in there where you have a lot more scientists, you have teachers, you have engineers, you have-- I mean we have an astronaut who was up there last year who's a biomedical scientist who has done research on, you know, AIDS in Africa-- like all-- they come from all of these different walks of life.  >> Yeah.  >> And because a lot of the work that they're doing on station right now, it's not like it used to be. I mean you're not flying a space shuttle anymore. You are essentially a researcher or a research subject for six months while you're up there. So, they're coming from all walks of life now and that's going to continue and just expand more as more and more types of people and more and more people gain access to space, which is the ultimate goal. I mean, ultimately, we want everybody-- if they want-- to be able to go to outer space.  >> Right.  >> I mean I want to go to outer space.  >> I think-- I want to say we all do, but I know there's-- I know there's people who don't. They're like oh, I'm fine on the Earth. Yeah.  >> Again, it's-- so, there's always the inherent risk in everything and there are people who, you know-- there's always somebody who doesn't like something. That'll never change, but I mean--  >> Well, regardless, that's what the International Space Station is hoping is to accomplish. It's really helping us to understand that so that that can actually be a possibility later. And the more we do it, the more we learn, the more it can actually become a reality. The fact that it's a reality now is pretty awesome that we can actually do this. Well, Dan, thank you so much for coming on the show. I think that's about all of the time we have today.  >> I feel like I just got started.  >> I know.  >> I've left out so many things that people are going to yell at me about.  >> Well, I have like a bunch of questions in front of me, I don't think I-- I think I asked one. I think we just kind of talked afterwards, but thanks again for coming on. Probably have to do another podcast just on the International Space Station, right?  >> Oh, we're going to have to do--  >> That was just like skimming the surface.  >> Dozens.  >> International Space Station one, two, three-- yeah, 12, 13.  >> Let's make it an anthology.  >> That'll be awesome. Dan, thanks again and stay tuned for-- after the credits or music here to learn where you can submit your ideas and all that kind of stuff.  [ Music ]  >> Houston, go ahead.  >> Space shuttle.  >> Roger, zero-G and I feel fine.  >> Shuttle has cleared the tower.  >> The [inaudible] for all mankind.  >> It's actually a huge honor to break a record like this.  >> Not because they are easy, but because they are hard.  >> Houston, welcome to space.  >> Hey, thanks for sticking around. So, today we talked a lot about the International Space Station, but really just kind of skimmed the surface. If you really want to dive deep into some of the topics that we talked about today and maybe some things we didn't talk about, just go to nasa.gov/iss. That's our homepage. That's where all the latest scientific experiments and updates and findings and everything going on with the International Space Station, launches, landings, it's all updated regularly. We have a blog that we like to maintain on that page, as well as all the astronauts that you can follow, the ones both on space station and not on the space station. On social media, we're very active. On Facebook, it's International Space Station, Twitter at space underscore station, and on Instagram it's at ISS. Go to any one of those platforms and we update those regularly. You can even use the hashtag AskNASA on your favorite platform to submit an idea or maybe a question that you have for this podcast. Just make sure to mention that it's for Houston, we have a Podcast or maybe HWHAP I guess would be the acronym for that. Probably have to fix that, but just mention us and we'll try to address your question in one of the later podcasts. This podcast was recorded on March 17th, 2017. Thanks to Alex Perryman [assumed spelling] and John Stohl [assumed spelling] for helping record the episode and, of course, thanks to Dan Huot for coming on the show. So, this show is intended to be weekly and we have a few episodes kind of sitting in the bank, so it may be a few episodes before we get to your question on social media, but please keep them coming. And thanks for listening. So, until next week.",

        description: "Production Transcript for Ep41 The Space Launch System Part.1.mp3 Gary Jordan (Host):  Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center Episode 41, the Space Launch System part one.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  On this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know the coolest information right here at NASA.  So, today, we're talking about the most powerful rocket since the Saturn V moon rocket.  It's called NASA's Space Launch System.  So, we've got two guests from Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama here with us today to tell us a little bit about the rocket, the payloads it will carry.  Don't worry.  We'll define what a payload is.  And then, where it's going to go.  Spoiler alert, it will bring people big stuff and little stuff all farther than we've ever gone before.  Wait.  Why did I do that?  That totally ruins the, oh wait.  Never mind.  It doesn't ruin anything.  This is a really good topic, jam packed with information.  So much information that we're going to do this in two parts.  This is part one.  So, with us today are David Smith and Paul Bookout.  David is the Vice President for Advanced Programs at Victory Solutions in Huntsville, Alabama.   He has a long career in aerospace engineering and is a Subject Matter Expert on rocket architecture and how payloads fit inside the rocket.  He wrote the SLS mission planner's guide which gives payload developers a general idea of the capabilities of the rocket and some technical specifications, so they can determine how their payloads might fit inside of it.  He looks after some of the big payloads.  Our other guest is Dr. Paul Bookout, EM-1 Secondary Payloads Integration Manager who manages integration of five CubeSats in the giant rocket as well as the avionics that will control deployment of the 13 small satellite payloads on the first mission of SLS and Orion called Exploration Mission-1, EM-1.  He spends his time managing the little payloads, not much bigger than a shoebox, that goes inside of a skyscraper-sized rocket.  So, we're going to be talking about just how powerful this monster rocket is, its unique capabilities, and what it will be used for, where it is in its development, its first mission with the Orion crew vehicle, and then look ahead to the future to missions to the moon, to Mars, and throughout the solar system.   So, we are go for launch with Mr. David Smith and Dr. Paul Bookout for the Space Launch System Program.  T minus five, four, three, two, one, zero, and liftoff of Episode 41 of Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Always wanted to do that.  Feel like I just ruined it.  You know what?  Let's just start.     [ Music ]    Host:  T minus five second and counting.  Mark.     [ Music ]    Host:  There she goes.    Host:  Houston, we have a podcast.     [ Music ]    Host:  All right.  Paul and David, thanks so much for coming on the podcast today.  We talked about Orion on a few episodes so far but really haven't had the privilege to talk about he giant rocket that Orion is going to be on, the SLS.  And, we have you guys here from Marshall to actually talk to us about this rocket.  So, thank you very much for coming on.    David Smith:  Sure.    David Smith:  Thank you for having us.    Host:  Our pleasure.    Host:  All right.  Just to sort of back up, we have Paul Bookout and David Smith, so you guys want to talk a little bit about each one, so we can identify your voices.    Paul Bookout:  David, go ahead.    David Smith:  Well, sure.  I'm just an engineer.  My associate Dr. Bookout is a doctor.    Host:  Okay.    David Smith:  But, we both work together on trying to find innovative ways to associate payloads with the capability of SLS which is going to be the world's largest rocket.  So, I kind of look at the larger payloads, and Dr. Bookout looks at maybe some of the other kind, smaller payloads that can fit in the niches that are left over.    Paul Bookout:  Well, thank you Vice President David.    David Smith:  Yes.    Paul Bookout:  I appreciate you talking about introducing myself.  So, what we have is secondary payloads.  Again, we're just trying to understand the whole utilization of SLS since it's going to be the most powerful rocket built since the Saturn V. It's going to have a lot more capability, so we want to utilize it to its fullest.    Host:  Okay.  So, you said there's going to be, basically, we're going to utilize the rocket to its maximum potential.  We got this big rocket, and we're going to test it.  But, while we test it, let's put some cool stuff on it.    Paul Bookout:  Exactly.    Host:  So, let's back up and talk about just SLS.  What is SLS?  What is this giant rocket that we're talking about?    Paul Bookout:   SLS is America's rocket.  It's the next NASA's launch vehicle that's going to be able to put humans back to the moon and further out into deep space.  Of course, a lot of it's built on shuttle hardware heritage.  The SLS rocket's made up of the solar rocket boosters, a main core, an upper stage, and then the crew Orion spacecraft with a co-manifest payload or a primary payload.  And, David will talk a little bit more about that later.  So, of course, this is NASA's first exploration class launch vehicle since Saturn V, so we're going to be putting humans back to the moon, out to deep space, and eventually, you know, to Mars systems.  It has a very large mass lift capability and also volume, so some of these larger probes that are satellites or probes that are going to outer planets that they'll be able to arrive at their destination in just a few years instead of maybe eight to ten years.   [00:05:24] You're cutting that trip down to one or two years.  So, it's a lot of savings there.   Host:  So, that's a really important part to kind of hone in on is just the versatility of this rocket.  You're talking about a giant rocket that can take people, giant payloads, faster, farther.  That's pretty much the whole summary of the SLS, right?    Paul Bookout:  Yes.  Definitely.    Host:  So, what's, what does it take to be human rated?  So, I guess the difference between something that's not a rocket and something that is.    Paul Bookout:  Of course, it goes through the whole development process, starts at the beginning.  You have to have safety emission assurances involved from the very beginning.  Just an overview, you have to have, like redundant systems.  If something goes wrong with one system, there's another system to kick in to back up to still make the vehicle safe.  There's safety reviews throughout the whole process.  We do additional testing, a lot more testing than other commercial launch vehicles do just to make sure that the vehicle is safe for humans.    Host:  That's really the main thing, right?    Paul Bookout:  Yeah.    [00:06:33] Host:  The safety.  But, then, also the redundancy because I guess redundancy is cost.  Redundancy is weight.  So, you have to factor that into a rocket where you can just say, \"Oh, if it fails, you know, with the primary systems, it fails.\"  But, at least the only thing we lose is this piece of hardware.  And, not to say that that's not a bad thing, but.    Paul Bookout:  Right.    Host:  It's very different from human life.  So, I guess, absolutely, you need to be considerate of that.    Paul Bookout:  Right.  And, there is a tradeoff, as you was saying.  Additional systems, more mass, and that's mass that is being taken away from your primary payloads.    Host:  Yeah.    Paul Bookout:  And lift capability, but we need that to be safe.    Host:  You know what?  I actually always wanted to ask this question, but you said primary payloads.  I get this question all the time from folks not in NASA, and it's just, we use this term all the time, but what, to you, is a payload?    [00:07:22] Paul Bookout:  A payload is anything that goes up on top of the rocket that's lifted into space.  It can be a satellite.  I can be probes.  Of course, the Orion spacecraft, once it's on the rocket, it can have its own second co-manifested payload along with it.  So, just anything, really, that's launched into space.    Host:  Does a person count as a payload.    Paul Bookout:  We don't like to refer to.     [ Laughter ]    Host:  It doesn't humanize it as much, right?    Paul Bookout:  No, it doesn't.  No.    Host:  So, I guess, for example, going back to that co-manifest thing, the Orion.  The Orion would be the payload.  That would be the primary thing that you want to bring into orbit.    Paul Bookout:  Correct.    Host:  But, then, there's something that is, something called co-manifested which means it's not the primary thing, but it's also part of the part that you want to lift the mission.    Paul Bookout:  Correct.    Host:  Okay.    Paul Bookout:  For example, on the second generation of the SLS rocket, it will have capability of launching a co-manifest payload along with Orion, and it could be anywhere from additional probe going out into the moon, or it can be call separation bus, propulsion system that's launched.  And, then, when a habitat is launched, then they can be combined and go to the moon.  So, it's, allows us to build capabilities out in space, too, with co-manifested payloads.    Host:  Okay.    Paul Bookout:  Along with Orion.    Host:  Is that one of the things you're working on?  Or, you're working on, I guess, secondary payload?    Paul Bookout:  Yes.  I'm mainly focused in on secondary payloads.    Host:  So, what's secondary payloads?    Paul Bookout:  Okay.  Secondary payloads, or they call auxiliary payloads.    Host:  Okay.    Paul Bookout:  They're payloads that do not drive the primary mission of the, of that launch.  For example, on EM-1, we have secondary payloads on that.  That's EM-1, Exploration Mission-1.    Host:  Okay.    Paul Bookout:  First launch of SLS rocket.    David Smith:  Yeah.    Paul Bookout:  We have 13 payloads on that, and I'll talk a little bit more about that later.  But, the primary requirements they have is for secondary payloads in general is do no harm to the vehicle and minimal impact.  So, the do no harm aspect is that we have to fly safe.  The whole system, deployment system and everything, is designed to be safe.  Like, all the CubeSats are turned off during launch.  They have to have, like, redundant systems, as in two separation switches that allow them to turn on.  Because, if one fails while we're being launched, it could turn on the systems.  So, we have two there.    Host:  Oh, okay.    Paul Bookout:  To back that up, to keep it safe.  And then, minimal requirements, of course, if the rocket is ready to launch and the secondary payload's not ready yet, it's going to launch.  Because it does not affect the primary mission of the payload, of the launch.    Host:  Right.    Paul Bookout:  Of that.    Host:  Well, that puts a lot of constraints on you, then, huh?    Paul Bookout:  Yes, yes it does.    Host:  Because, not only do you have to worry about these, and I guess we can kind of hone in on the CubeSats a little bit later.  But, you have to worry about the CubeSats, but now you have to add something else to it.  Now, you have to add these redundant systems.  And then, there's no guarantee that if you're not ready, that's okay.  We're going to go without you.    Paul Bookout:  Right.  Exactly. SLS is, the first rocket's not going to be the only configuration of SLS.  And, of course, SLS is Space Launch System.  We, the first launch is going to be called Block 1.  Then, we're going to be stepping up to Block 1B which means we're going to be adding a different upper stage.  Right now, we're utilizing an existing Boeing ULA upper stage to use on this mission, mainly to save initial money so we can develop the core stage.  And, once the core stage has been developed, then we can have additional funds to start developing the new upper stage or exploration upper stage.    Host:  Okay.    Paul Bookout:  Okay?  And, that's going to be the Block 1B configuration.  And, Block 1B will have actually two configurations.  It'll be a crew which was, as we talked about before, the Orion spacecraft with a co-manifested payload.  The other configuration will be the Block 1B cargo where that would be your primary payloads.  So, the only payload will be that major payload.    Host:  Okay.  So, when you say \"Block\", you're looking at the entire rocket configuration.    Paul Bookout:  Correct.    Host:  And, Block 1 is this configuration with the ULE booster, right?    Paul Bookout:  Right.    Host:  Okay.  And then, Block 1B has the NASA booster on top.    Paul Bookout:  Correct.    Host:  Instead of the ULA, but then you can do crew or cargo on that one.    Paul Bookout:  Exactly.    Host:  Whereas, EM-1 you don't, and EM-1, we can get into this later, is, you're not going to have crew on it, right?  That's not part of the test.  That's for one of the later missions.    Paul Bookout:  Correct.    Host:  I see.  So, really, the blocks are kind of the stages of developing the rocket into its full capability of.    Paul Bookout:  Right.    Host:  Of this eventual Mars lander.  That's awesome.  So, now, you're using these commercial elements.  You're using ULA in Block 1 and the leftover solid rocket boosters until, eventually, 1B, 1B crew, you get to Block 2.  Now, you have the configuration.  New boosters.  You got the NASA upper stage.  You got all of these configurations, and now you can go to, where can you go?    David Smith:  Well.    Host:  Is it just to Mars?    David Smith:  Well, you really need Block 2, ultimately, to fulfill a human settlement on the lunar surface as well.    Host:  Really?    David Smith:  You need a kind of lift capability.  But, if you want to assemble an architecture, because it'll take multiple flights of a Block 2 to assemble a human architecture capable of transiting to Mars, you'll need four to five Block 2 flights at a time to assemble that stack that can go to Mars.    Host:  So, what's, I guess, how much more power does Block 2 provide you that, I guess, Block 1B would not?    David Smith:  Well, it nominally, you're talking another 25 tons or so.  So, it could bring a second Orion vehicle in comparison because Orion weighs about 25 tons.  So, it, really, from a lift standpoint, is maybe a fifth more powerful than the Block 1B, and it gives you that extra diameter, potentially for the payload ferrying that would allow, you know, the smaller the diameter of the ferrying, the taller a lander needs to be.  And, think about a lander on the surface of the moon or Mars, if it's three or four stories, that's a lot of vertical height an astronaut has to overcome every time they're taking stuff back and forth.    Host:  That's right.    David Smith:  So, we're, the larger the diameter, the shorter can be the squatter, can be the easier it is to manipulate items on and off a lander.  Whether it's on the moon or Mars.    Host:  Okay.  Wow.  So, then, you're talking about once this Block 2 configuration is done with the new solid rocket boosters, you can actually have a wider payload go on top of the rocket.    David Smith:  Right.  Well, there's a nuclear thermal propulsion that's out there that has the potential of getting people to Mars a lot sooner.  It needs a much larger diameter because it used hydrogen as a fuel.  Hydrogen is very bulky because it isn't very dense.  And so, if we were ever to use a new kind of propulsion that would lower the time to get to Mars, you need a Block 2 vehicle.  A smaller rocket will never allow you to do nuclear thermal propulsion.    Host:  Okay.  Let's go back to some of these other configurations.  I kind of want to get a sense of the look and feel of this rocket.  We sort of talked about it, but to just sort of go into detail.  If I was looking at let's just say the Block 1 configuration, the one that's actually going to go for EM-1, what does that look like?  How tall is it?  What's the weight of it?  How much power?    David Smith:  Right.  So, roughly Block 1 and 1B are somewhat similar.    Host:  Okay.    David Smith:  They're going to be about the same height as the Saturn V.    Host:  Oh.    David Smith:  Which means it's a big rocket, but part of that's because we can't really exceed the vehicle assembly building limitations that are at the Cape.  So, you want to make it as big as you can, so you can put as much fuel in it as you can.  Basically, the thrust of the Block 1 vehicle which is similar to the Block 1B for the solid rocket motors is about 3.6 million pounds each.  Those only fly for about two minutes.  Then, you have the core engines.  There's four space shuttle era type SSMEs that each have about 512,000 pounds of thrust.  You multiply that by four.  They operate for about eight minutes.  Together, you get about a total thrust of about 8.8 million pounds which gives you an escape velocity of over 22,000 miles an hour.  The core stage itself is about 2/3 the length of a football field which is pretty tremendous.  One single stage of this vehicle's about 2/3 of a football stadium.  And, which is around 212 feet, and the Block 1B ferrying that we talked about, the 8.4-meter diameter ferrying, could accommodate up to three school buses inside its volume.  So, that's pretty incredible when you think about the size of what can be lofted in a single vehicle like that.   In comparison, the Block 1 vehicle, you know, can throw 70 tons to lower earth orbit where the shuttle can only do 28 tons to low earth orbit.  So, it's about three times more powerful than the shuttle.    Host:  Wow.  So, you're talking, you're comparing it to the Saturn V in terms of its size but talking about these efficient engines.  What makes, what is it about the engines that's more efficient that's giving you this extra power?    David Smith:  Well, they, you know, the shuttle engines were rated at 100% thrust originally, and I think they got them up to 109%.  So, they actually got them to work 9% more efficiently at the end of the shuttle program.  We're taking these up to 11% more thrust, and maybe even 13% more thrust.  So, you're really pushing these engines to their limit, and the, it's really coupling their efficiency now at 113% thrust with the reliability of the shuttle system.    Host:  Unbelievable.  The engine itself is called an RS25, right?    Paul Bookout:  Yes.    Host:  That's what it's called.  And, these are the engines that were on the shuttle.  Now, you're pretty much just putting it on the SLS, but it sounds like there's a good reason for that.  It's because you've flown the shuttle so many times, improved the capability of it past its, like, total 100% thrust ratio.  Now, you're going, you're going past the 100%.  So, basically, is like why would we, why would we do something else?  We worked so hard on this one.  This one is, like, extremely efficient.  Why would we, and we can make it even more efficient.  That's the logic behind it?    Paul Bookout:  Well, right.  Initially, of course, we have about, I believe, 16 space shuttle main engines or these RS25s left over from the shuttle program.  So, we're utilizing the existing hardware to save cost while we're developing the core stage.  You know, the first part of the SLS.    Host:  Yeah.    Paul Bookout:  And, as you mentioned, we are updating the engines, getting more capability out of them.  So, to that point, we can do four per, so we can do about four launches, four rocket, or four engines on each launch.  So, we can do about four launches with the current RS25s.    Host: Okay.  And, that, is that for one of the later configurations?    Paul Bookout: That's correct.    Host: Okay.    Paul Bookout: Yeah.    Host: Is it the Block 2?    Paul Bookout: The Block 2.    Host: Block 2?    Paul Bookout: Block 2 and beyond.    Host: Oh, okay.  I see.  I see where the whole idea of staging this whole thing comes from, right?    Paul Bookout: Correct.    Host:  You've got, you're using the leftover solid rocket boosters, and you're using this commercial upper stage.  And, it's just basically getting to this point where you're going to maximize the efficiency of the rocket.    Paul Bookout:  Right.    Host:  Unbelievable.  So, three school buses inside of the 1B configuration, right?  That's, is it about the weight of three school buses?  Is like taking three school buses to space?    David Smith:  No, it would be, it would be more than that.    Host:  More than that?    David Smith:  I mean, nominally, if you went to the moon, we're going to take, the Block 1B could take roughly 40 tons to lunar vicinity which is, which is pretty incredible.  Host:  Wow, and just in terms of not only, like, quantity, you're talking three school buses.  But, also size.    David Smith:  Yeah, and mass.    Host:  Also weight.    David Smith:  Right.    Host:  You know, you got all of these, all these different components.  So, I guess we can kind of focus in on now that we kind of understand the rocket and the evolution of the rocket, let's go to that first, that first test flight, EM-1.  We've talked about EM-1 on the podcast before, especially from testing Orion and that.  But, really haven't focused in on what is it about, what is it about EM-1 that we're testing SLS for?  So, let's start with that.  What are we going to test, and I guess we can kind of start with the overview of EM-1 for those who haven't listened to it before.    Paul Bookout:  Right.  So, EM-1 is, of course, going to be the first launch of the SLS rocket.  Its primary segments are, of course, solid rocket motors which are a heritage from shuttle hardware.  Shuttle had four segments, where EM-1 is going to have five segment motors.  Then, of course, the core stage which is heritage off the shuttle external tank but made longer for additional capability of fuel.  And, we're also using the main engines from the shuttle program with updated technology and ratings to get more power out of those four rockets on there.  So, that makes up the primary lift capability of the SLS rocket.  On top of that, we have an interim cryogenic propulsion stage, which, or second stage, upper stage, that we're utilizing from Boeing, existing hardware for EM-1 mission.  And then, of course, in addition to adaptors, then there will be the Orion spacecraft, which is the primary mission of EM-1 is to test out the SLS rocket.   Then, also, to test out the Orion spacecraft with its trajectory and telemetries and communications.  It's going to be on about a 25 1/2 day mission to distant retrograde orbit.  That really means just go way past the moon and come back.    Host:  Yeah.    Paul Bookout:  You know, a 25 1/2 day trip.  Of course, and, you know, we're doing all this because, again, for the safety aspects.  We want to test the vehicle out and Orion spacecraft before we put humans in it.    Host:  Right.    Paul Bookout:  So, we want to make sure it's safe, make sure everything works.  And, that's that safety aspect, that human rated part of a launch vehicle.    Host:  So, the human rated part is the Orion can go to 25.5 days, or is this going past what it's expected to possibly operate at?    David Smith:  I think that's a nominal timeframe for the Orion with crew.  So, this is pretty much, I think, its extreme capability.    Host:  Yeah.    David Smith:  But, you know, part of it is testing just the systems period.  You always, for human rating, you always want to test it far in, you know, far from what the humans will actually experience so that you have a safety factor that's sufficient for human use.    Host:  Oh, yeah.  Because if you're going to be operating on, say, 16 day missions, you don't really want to, okay.  Well, let's just test 16.    Paul Bookout:  Exactly.    Host:  You really want to go kind of further out and see, all right.  Let's see how far this puppy can go.    David Smith:  And, I think part of this mission's objective is to bring it in at a lunar return velocity to test that heat shield.    Host:  Yeah.    David Smith:  You can't do it from low earth orbit.  You got to kind of go out and bring it in fast, so.    Host:  So, what's the difference with EFT-1?  That was one of the first test flights we did where we didn't go all the way out to the moon, but we did kind of a, this large apogee so that we can get up to, I think it was some, like 25,000 miles.  Or, maybe it was a little slower than that.  The difference is between EFT-1 and EM-1.    David Smith:  I think, I think it was very close to what they would experience in a lunar return, but it's not the actual lunar return.    Host:  I see.    David Smith:  Right, so you want to be able to stage it.  You want to go out in orbit.  You want to test the time that you're out in orbit.  That was a very short mission, maybe five or six hours.  Now, we're talking 25 days.  Well, all the equipment still work when it's, you know, soaked in a cold temperature, hot temperature, all those days.  And, now, you're coming in.  Will it all work when it comes to the right moment.  So, this really puts the pedal to the metal.    Host:  That's right.  So, what is it?  I guess the relationship between what are you guys looking at for SLS versus Orion on this particular mission, EM-1?    Paul Bookout:  So, for SLS, again, we want to test all the systems, make sure they're fully functional.  We'll be checking out redundant systems indirectly, of course.  And, communications with the vehicle, since it's the first time the vehicle's being launched.  We're all, we're talking with the vehicle all the way up.    Host:  Yeah.    Paul Bookout:  So, we want to make sure all those ground systems are ready to support, actually, human flight mission.  So, it's just not the vehicle.  It's the overall architecture of everything that goes into supporting a launch that we want to verify and check out.    Host:  Oh, that's right.  Now, we're preparing to go into fly deep space missions.  So, not only is it, all right, let's test the hardware, but let's test to operational aspect.    Paul Bookout:  Exactly.    Host:  Let's test what it's going to take to actually do these missions from the broadest perspective possible.    David Smith:  And, that includes, even, just bringing the, you know, the pieces are being built all over the place.    Host:  Yeah.    David Smith:  And, tested all over the place.  So, just bringing them together at the cape and making sure they can be integrated in a safe and timely fashion for launch.  That, in itself, is a really important objective.  We're talking about such a large rocket.    Paul Bookout:  Yeah, so this is the first time all those components going to be coming together, and there's going to be hiccups along the way.  And, we just need to understand how this vehicle goes together and make sure we do it correctly.    Host:  So, you say the vehicle's going to be talking to you guys throughout its flight.  What is it going to be telling you?  What kinds of data are you really looking for that's really going to tell you that this thing is working how we're expecting it to work?    David Smith:  Well, remember, you're talking to payload guys, so, you know, we're more interested in seeing what the payload's going to experience.    Host:  Yeah.    David Smith:  But, think about this.  When it launches on the pad, it has an incredible noise issue coming off that mobile launch platform.  That's why, if you remember, they had these things called rainbirds, the big sprinklers that start spraying as soon as the engines go to try to mitigate that noise.    Host:  Right.    David Smith:  The payload is particularly sensitive to it.  Obviously, the vehicle itself is sensitive to that noise as well.  So, acoustic mitigation is one of the most important things at launch.  Then, we have a thermal issue, right?  We go up to max Q, max dynamic pressure.  We have a certain heating that is, occurs on the outside of the vehicle.  And, before, we got to get through all that heating before we can make sure that the crew is going to be safe, that we can take the shielding off the Orion and so forth.  So, we're going to be testing all those environmental concerns as we go forward, and of course, the jettisoning of, you know, the SRBs off the core stage.  Then, the ICPS in Orion off the core stage.  And then, of course, then, the Orion off the ICPS.  All these jettison events, and there's quite a few of them, are extremely important, and we need to test those.  Each one has its associated thermal and acoustic issues.  So, we're going to test each one of those as it goes forward.    Paul Bookout:  Since this is the first launch of SLS rocket, we don't really understand the full environments that it's going to be launched in.  As David mentioned, the thermal, interior thermal, acoustic, vibration.  It's the first time we're going to launch it.  So, what we're also have is a lot of instrumentation on this vehicle to be able to measure the actual vibration levels and everything else.  So, we can, once we go back to designing and looking at what we call safety factors, reducing those so we can have more margin on the vehicle and means that goes into more mass lift capabilities.  So, we're trying to understand the overall characteristics of the vehicle itself.  So, in addition, for secondary payload, or payloads in general, we can give them more of an accurate environment that they will see during launch.  As in, how much vibration they'll feel, how much thermal environments that they'll see.  So, when they start designing their payloads for, to run the ride on this vehicle, they can have more of an accurate environment.   And, maybe not have, make it a lot more efficient design.    Host:  Okay.  So, then, what data are you going off of now based on, you guess you haven't launched the SLS.  So, what are you assuming, or where are you getting the data from?    David Smith:  We have, we started off with assuming, at least for the payloads, that we would provide an ELV, and expendable launch vehicle class environment.    Host:  Okay.    David Smith:  So, if you've flown on Atlas or Delta, you should expect nothing worse than that.    Host:  Okay.    David Smith:  That's our starting point.    Host:  Oh, okay.    David Smith:  Now, what Paul's going into is we're going to try to characterize is that really true?  So, the first flight's important.  Are we in?  Are we out?  What do we have to do?  Is there more foam that you got to put in the payload section to mitigate the noise?  That's what we're trying to figure out.  But, we should be within an ELV class is what we're projecting right now.    Host:  Okay.  So, then, I'm assuming you're going to have some actual science on board EM-1, right?  Because you're testing, you're testing the structure of EM-1.  You're testing the rocket.  But then, you have this mission.  Why not take advantage of it?  Is there anything else going on the EM-1?    Paul Bookout:  Oh, definitely.    Host:  Okay, good.    Paul Bookout:  Yes.  We have, we'll have 13 secondary payloads that we're going to be launching on EM-1.    Host:  Wow.    Paul Bookout:  That'll, that is located in the Orion stage adapter.  That's the segment that connects the SLS rocket to the Orion spacecraft.  So, it's a small ring about five feet high.  About 18 or so feet in diameter.  And, along the inner circumference of that is where we are mounting these 13 secondary payloads.    Host:  Oh, so I guess they have to be kind of small, right?  That's not a lot of space compared to the, what's in the ferrying.    Paul Bookout:  Correct.  So, on EM-1, we have 13 CubeSats.  CubeSats are defined as a, we call a 1U, which is about ten by ten by ten-centimeter cube.    Host:  Okay.    Paul Bookout:  So, what we're having on EM-1 is allowing them to go up to what we call a 6U.  So, it's a CubeSat that's about the, a little bit larger than the size of a shoebox, a large shoebox.    Host:  Okay.    Paul Bookout:  And, that's kind of the dimensions of these 6U CubeSats that we're having on EM-1.    David Smith:  Which is the most common CubeSat, really, today, right?    Paul Bookout:  Correct.  Exactly.  So, we have multiple missions that these payloads are going to be doing.  So, we've got one destination is to the moon.  We have Lunar Flashlight which is out of Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and their primary mission is to search for ice deposits and resources on the moon using a laser.    Host:  Ooh.    Paul Bookout:  Okay.  And, the second one is Lunar IceCube which is Morehead State University up in Kentucky.  And, they're going to also be searching for water of all forms and volatiles on the moon using infrared spectrometer.  These are some big words that I can't even define, so.     [ Laughter ]  LunaH-Map is from Arizona State University, and they're going to be creating high fidelity map of near surface hydrogen in craters on the moon.  Lunar IR is from Lockheed Martin in Colorado, and they're going to be performing advanced infrared imagery of lunar surface.  We've got one that's going to the sun facility, and it's called CuSP.  It's from Southwest Research Institute here in Texas, and it's going to be measuring particles and magnetic fields of space weather between us and the sun.  We have one that's going around the Earth.  It's called EQUULEUS.  It's a Japanese payload, and we actually have three international payloads on this mission.  And, I'll touch on those others.    Host:  Awesome.    Paul Bookout:  So, again, EQUULEUS is from JAXA.  It's the University of Tokyo supporting that.  I mean, it's imaging the Earth's plasma sphere for a better understanding of Earth radiation environment.  And also, it's going to be initially on the far side of the moon and detecting any meteor crater flashes that may impact the far side of the moon.    Host:  Wow.    Paul Bookout:  So, they'll be out there for about two months or so and just hopefully they'll be able to catch something.  Some of the other missions are BioSentinel.  It's from Ames Research Center, and they're going to be using baker's yeast to see the effects of radiation on actual live items, you know, live yeast.  And, then, ArgoMoon, which is the European Space Agency, is built in Italy.  It's going to be observing the interim cryogenic propulsion stage.  That's upper stage is going to be deployed.  Look at that upper stage, and then it's going to go on some additional missions.  And, it's going to look at the upper stage to see what kind of effects the environment has during liftoff on the upper stage.  Because, until now, we, once the upper stage is launched, we usually don't get a chance to look the conditions of that.  This will give us some feedback and see what the upper stage has went through, if there's any damage or anything.    Host:  It sounds like these CubeSats are all over the place.    Paul Bookout:  Yes.  Yeah.  I've got a couple more here.    Host:  Oh, really.    Paul Bookout:  I haven't got to my two favorite yet.  So.    Host:  Oh, we're standing by.    Paul Bookout:  Okay.  Centennial Challenge.  That was a challenge that NASA set up called Cube Quest, and it's to help develop communications for these smaller CubeSats.  There's two challenges.  One was a lunar challenge to around the lunar surface and for longevity.  And, the other one was a deep space mission which was a CubeSat, as it says, going out into deep space to see how far and long and what burst rates and clarity that you can have in your signals.  So, there's total prizes for everything through all the development and final missions.  It's up to $5 million.    Host:  Wow.    Paul Bookout:  So, that's a lot of money.    Host:  Yeah.    Paul Bookout:  Spread out over those.  So, you did, you asked what my two favorite payloads are.    Host:  Oh, yeah.    Paul Bookout:  Let me tell you.  One of them is NEA Scout.  That's developed at Marshall Spaceflight Center.  What's unique about that is NEA Scout means Near Earth Asteroid.  So, they're going to be going to a near earth asteroid.  But, the exciting thing about it is that they're going to be using solar cell to get there for their propulsion system.  So, this is the first time a solar cell will be used to, for propulsion out into deep space.  There have been other missions in low earth orbit to check out the technology and feasibility of solar cells, but this is the first time going out to deep space.  And, for a CubeSat that's a little bit larger than a shoebox, it will be deploying the cell that will be 40 by 40 feet.    Host:  Whoa.    Paul Bookout:  So, that's huge.    Host:  Wait, and a little CubeSat.    Paul Bookout:  In a little CubeSat.    Host:  And, it deploys a 40 foot.    Paul Bookout:  Yes.    Host:  Oh, wow.    Paul Bookout:  Yeah, so that solar cell is very thin material.    Host:  Yeah.  It must be to fold up into, like, this ten-centimeter cube thing.    Paul Bookout:  Exactly.    Host:  So, so, the solar.    Paul Bookout:  You said ten centimeters.  6U CubeSat is 10 by 20 by 30.    Host:  Oh, because this is 6U.    Paul Bookout:  6U, correct.    Host:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Okay.  So, solar sails, though, this is, it basically unfurls this 40-foot sail, and is it the one where the high-power laser that pushes it?    Paul Bookout:  No.    Paul Bookout:  That's different.    Paul Bookout:  This is going to ride the solar winds.    Paul Bookout:  Ride the solar winds.    Paul Bookout:  Solar particles will be pushing it along.  It'll do actually a fly by the near-earth asteroid as it comes up.  It'll be taking images all the way around as it passes.    Host:  Okay.  Wow.    Paul Bookout:  So, and my ultimate favorite one is.    Host:  Yeah, we didn't get the last one.    Paul Bookout:  Is actually the one that I'm the Secondary Payload Integration Manager for.    Host:  Oh.    Paul Bookout:  So, it's one of my CubeSats.    Host:  So, it's an unbiased favorite, then.    Paul Bookout:  Yes.    Host:  Okay.    Paul Bookout:  Yeah, still.  It's called OMOTENASHI.  It's another Japanese CubeSat.    Host:  Okay.    Paul Bookout:  And, their mission is to land on the moon.    Host:  Oh.    Paul Bookout:  Can you imagine a small little CubeSat, you know, a little bit larger than a shoebox, land on the moon?  Of course, and the big thing about it is that they're going to be using a solid rocket motor to slow down to be able to land on the moon.  So, that's one of the things on EM-1 that we're offering that previous commercial launch vehicles and that don't offer propulsion systems for secondary payload to be able to utilize that.  That's one thing EM-1 and SLS is allowing.  So, that's a huge deal.    Host:  Yeah.    Paul Bookout:  For those.  So, if OMOTENASHI is successful at landing on the moon, they'll be the fourth nation in the world to have actually land and do some science on the moon.    Host:  Wow.    Paul Bookout:  You know.    Host:  So, what kind of science?    Paul Bookout:  Well, because, again, they're still a small payload, so they can't get large science instruments to the moon, when they land, actually land on the moon, all that will be left is about the size of a sandwich box.  Because they have to get rid of all the extra weight to be able to slow down enough to be able to land.  And, they'll probably so some soil impact measurements, as in how soft vibration, shock, as it's landing on the moon.  And, I, so, and they're only going to be able to do it for about 30 minutes or so.  Again, because of the size, what we're limiting them to.    Host:  Yeah.    Paul Bookout:  They can't get the mechanics, orbital mechanics and velocities and everything.  I'm sorry.    Host:  So, it's, it's kind of general on where you can land, then?  It's just like, it's just going to land.  It's not going to land in a targeted spot, I guess?    Paul Bookout:  Correct.  They know the general vicinity where it's going to land.    Host:  Okay.    Paul Bookout:  But, they can't have ultimate control, like any of the other landers that have larger systems, propulsion systems, to slow them down.  So, they would be actually, once the solar motor fires, they'll still be traveling at about 60 miles an hour when they impact the moon.  So, they're going to inflate these impact balloons to actually bounce, similar to what they've done on Mars, some of the Mars Rovers.    Host:  Okay.    Paul Bookout:  So, it'll come and impact moon and bounce and then finally rest on the moon.    Host:  Okay.    Paul Bookout:  And, do about 30 minutes of impact soil measurements.    Host:  Wow.  How would that be, though?  I'm imagining, I mean, landing at 60 miles an hour.  That's, you know.    Paul Bookout:  Well.    Host:  That's not slow, but at the same time, it's the moon, right?  It's.    Paul Bookout:  Right.  Yes, but then again, you're not going directly into it.  You know, you're coming in at an angle, too.    Host:  At an angle.    Paul Bookout:  So, it's not a fully impact.    Host:  Okay.  Great.    Paul Bookout:  Direct impact, so.    Host:  So, you got all these CubeSats going around the Earth, around the upper stage, around the moon, on the moon, to deep space.  Where do you deploy, how does that work?  Where do you deploy everything?  It's not just like you just let everything go at all.  It has to be pretty controlled because each one has a very specific mission.    Paul Bookout:  Right.  We've created what we call bus stops.    Host:  Oh.    Paul Bookout:  They're basically different aspects of the trajectory of the upper stage.  So, the first bus stop is when you're in between the two radiation belts or Van Allen belts.  Bus stop two is when you've passed all the radiation belts.  Bus stop three is half way between the Earth and the moon.  Bus stop four is the closest proximity to the moon, and bus stop five is when you're going into a heliosynchronous or sun orbit.  And, that's where the upper stage will be disposed into the sun orbit.  So, when a payload says, \"Hey, I want to get off at 200,000 miles away from the Earth.\"  Well, okay, where is that exactly?  So, that's why we kind of created these bus stops.    Host:  I see.    Paul Bookout:  They can get off anywhere they want to, but it helps us relate to the areas where they want off.  So, most of them are wanting off at stop one.  About seven or eight of them.  Because they need to get out and start changing their trajectory as soon as possible.  Again, we're offering propulsion systems, but they're not large enough to have really change their directions further on.  So, a little change at first makes a big change later.    Host:  Yeah.    Paul Bookout:  So, they want to get off to be able to do that, make those little changes.  Most of the payloads that are going to lunar orbit, what they're wanting to do is slow down because the ICPS, you know, is launching Orion into this distant retrograde orbit.  And, you know, way past the moon.    Host:  Yeah.    Paul Bookout:  So, it has a lot of velocity heading that way, and if the payloads don't slow down, they'll just go flying past the moon.  The moon can't, doesn't have enough gravity to pull them back into an orbit.  And, some of them, even though they are going to the moon, they'll actually fly past the moon, and it may take a month or so for them to come back, to slow down enough to come back and get hooked into the moon's gravity and start orbiting the moon.    Host:  Oh, wow.    Paul Bookout:  So, it's not a direct flight into the moon orbit, just because they don't have the propulsion systems large enough to be able to do that.    Host:  So, is it fair to say they're all going to be in a very similar orbit, or are they all going to kind of go their respective directions?    Paul Bookout:  They're going to do their respective ways.    Host:  Okay.    Paul Bookout:  Some of them wants to do in the crater, so they're going to be going to the pole system, up to the poles to look see if there's ice up in there.  And, some of them will just be doing a regular geosynchronous type of orbit.    Host:  Okay.    Paul Bookout:  Type thing.    Host:  All right.    Paul Bookout:  We talked about where these, what the payloads are and where they're going to want to get off.  To be able to allow them to get off, again, we have to have a deployment system where, again, some of the primary requirements for EM-1 was or SLS is to do no harm and to have minimal impact to the vehicle.    Host:  Yes.    Paul Bookout:  Well, to do that latter one, what we've come up with a system is that we will receive an energy, the avionics unit for deploying the secondary payloads will receive an energy pulse for, from Orion.  Or, I'm sorry.  Will receive an energy pulse from the upper stage once Orion has already left and the upper stage has gone through its disposal maneuvers.  That means burning off extra fuel and everything making it safe.  Right before it shuts down, it will turn on the avionics unit for deploying the secondary payloads.  Then, the upper stage turns off.  So, we wake up, and we've got our own internal battery system.  And, each payload is inside of a dispenser, and so, the dispenser operates as the, has a spring-loaded lid.  And, the payloads inside are installed by compressing the spring.  So, when the, when it's time for that particular payload to be deployed, we get an energy pulse from the avionics unit sent to the dispenser to open the door.   The door flings open, and then the secondary payload is pushed out by springs.  So, that's how they're deployed.    Host:  Okay.  So, like a, so, like an SLS jack in the box.  [laughter]    Paul Bookout:  If you will.    Host:  That's what I'm imagining.  Obviously, it's going to shoot out.    Paul Bookout:  We have pulled those analogies before, but I'll let you state it.    Host:  And then, I guess there's, you get this power pulse that's going to, I guess, be directed to whatever seven is going to be part of bus stop one, and whatever the next ones for bus stop two.    Paul Bookout:  Correct.    Host:  Okay.    Paul Bookout:  And, they'll be deployed, if there's multiple at a particular bus stop, they'll be deployed a minute or two away from each other, after each other because we don't want to be able to deploy one and then deploy another one right behind it.    Host:  Yeah.    Paul Bookout:  And then, they have recontact.    Host:  So, I'm trying to imagine the way everything is situated in my head, and at this part of the flight when you're starting to deploy these secondary payloads, what does, what does the rocket, I guess, or what does the piece that's actually flying, what does it look like?  I guess you have Orion and then there's this deployment system, and then there's, is it the upper stage behind it?    Paul Bookout:  Okay.  So, once we've launched.    Host:  Yeah.    Paul Bookout:  After about two minutes, the solar rocket motors are.    David Smith:  Jettisoned.    Paul Bookout:  Jettisoned.  And then, the core stage lifts the rest of the vehicle up into orbit.  And, after that time, when the core stage is spent, then it'll be jettisoned.  And then, you'll have your upper stage and your Orion spacecraft which of course the secondary payloads are still in part of that.  And then, then, it'll go into what they call a translunar injection that's basically the upper stage will ignite and put Orion into its mission profile going past the moon.    Host:  So, at this point, right before it ignites, it's still in, I guess, Earth orbit, and the translunar injection gets it to the moon.    Paul Bookout:  Correct.    Host:  Okay.    Paul Bookout:  Okay.  So, once the upper stage has spent its fuel, the Orion spacecraft will separate, okay?  From the upper stage.  So, it'll go through on to its mission.  And then, about 30 minutes later, 20, 30 minutes later, the secondary payloads will start their deployment.    Host:  I see.  Okay.    Paul Bookout:  So, Orion is well away and actually speeding faster away from the upper stage.    Host:  Yeah.    Paul Bookout:  The upper stage, once it goes through its disposal maneuver, is actually flying kind of, you would say, backwards, engine first, towards the moon.    Host:  Oh.    Paul Bookout:  So, the secondary payloads will be ejected out the other direction.  So.    Host:  Okay.  So, so.    Paul Bookout:  So, when they're deployed, the ICPS won't run back into them.    Host:  That's right.    Paul Bookout:  Okay.  So, they'll be deployed in the other direction.    Host:  But, now, Orion is going in, it's doing its own thing.    Paul Bookout:  Correct.    Host:  Because it did its job.  It delivered Orion.  That's the primary payload.  Now, it's off.  But, the secondary payloads are still part of this upper stage.  They haven't gone with Orion.  They're totally separate.    Paul Bookout:  Correct.  They have their own.    Host:  So, it's like, they're kind of doing, they're going.    Paul Bookout:  Yeah.    Host:  Different ways.  Interesting.    Paul Bookout:  Yeah, they have their own mission profiles going in all different directions.    Host:  Okay.  Okay.  I don't know why that wasn't clear to me before but thank you.  All right.  So, I guess kind of backing up from there, you're talking about the solid rocket boosters are disposed.  The core stage is disposed.  Where are all these pieces going?    Paul Bookout:  Okay.  Depending on their mission profile, all the secondary payloads are going to end of missions at different places.  Some of them will be actually crashing into the moon, and that's common where the other countries and their lunar missions depositing on the moon.  Some will, one or two will burn up in Earth's atmosphere as it comes back.  Some of the other ones that are going out into deep space, of course, just keep going.  The CuSP, which is going to solar.  I'm sorry.  CuSP, which is going to the sun's vicinity will just stay out there and eventually be pulled into the sun.    Host:  Okay.    Host:  So, that's all the secondary payloads.    Paul Bookout:  Correct.  And, for each mission, each payload that's launched on U.S. rockets, they all have to have an end of mission plan.  What are they going to do to end their mission, not just to be left out there as space junk.  Because that's, we're having, sorry.  We're starting to have a lot of problems with, as you know, there's a lot of space junk around Earth.    Host:  Oh, yeah.    Paul Bookout:  And, you don't want that same situation around other planets, too.    Host:  That's fair.  That's fair.  And, that's why, that's part of the, I mean, this is going back, but Cassini, right?  That was the whole.  It did its thing, and instead of just letting it be.  It had a controlled entry into Saturn so that it didn't contaminate any other.    Paul Bookout:  Exactly.  Yes.    Host:  Any other bodies.  Yes, yes, of course.    Paul Bookout:  And, it doesn't matter what size you are.    Host:  Yeah.    Paul Bookout:  Even these small CubeSats have to have an end of mission.    Host:  Have to have an end of mission.    Paul Bookout:  Yes.    Host:  Awesome.  But, I did want to go back to some of the earlier parts of the mission, right after launch.  You know, you're talking about solid rocket boosters separating being.    David Smith:  Those go into the ocean.    Host:  Ocean?  Okay.    David Smith:  Still, but they're not recovered this time.    Host:  Oh, okay.    David Smith:  You know, for shuttle, they were recovered.  This time, it's too difficult.  They're too large.  So, they're just going to sink.    Host:  Okay.    [00:48:19] David Smith:  The external tank is, it can't go into orbit, so it's kind of lofted in such a way that it'll break up over the Indian Ocean safely.    Host:  Ah.    David Smith:  So, it's a very large tank.  You know, this is much larger than the external tank of shuttle, so it's very important that it break up safely.  So, that's, that's why you need the upper stage to actually bring the payload up into a circular orbit around the Earth.  Otherwise, the payload would go down with the core module as well.    Host:  Okay.  Okay.  And, what about the, I guess, the upper stage.  You said it's going to be doing this deployment, but then, after it deploys [inaudible].    David Smith:  It's heliocentric.  It goes into a sun, heliocentric disposal.    Host:  Sun heliocentric disposal.    David Smith:  So, it kind of goes away, and we should, hopefully, not see it again.    Host:  Okay.  All right.  That's a very nice summary of EM-1, and I feel like there's so much more to talk about.  I kind of wanted to get into, you know, where are we now with SLS, all the history of it.  So, I think we should take a break and just sort of let this one be Episode 41.  We'll come back, and we'll do Episode 42 and just sort of get into the process behind building the SLS and then the journeys of where it's going to go and beyond.  So, guys, thank you so much for coming on.  We'll take a break.  I'll see you in a few minutes.  And, for everyone else, I guess we'll see you for the next episode.    David Smith:  All right.    David Smith:  Great, thank you.  Look forward to it.    Paul Bookout:  Thank you.     [ Music ]    Houston, go ahead.     [ Inaudible Comment ]     [inaudible] for all mankind.    Not because they are easy, but because they are hard.    Welcome to space [echo].    Host:  Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So, the best places to follow development and delivery of the rocket as we test the major components and deliver it piece by piece to the Kennedy Space Center are on the social media channels on the web for the Space Launch System.  So, first the website.  You can go to www.nasa.gov/ guess what?  SLS.  That's where you can get the latest, the greatest on the Space Launch System.  On Twitter, it's @nasa underscore SLS.  On Facebook, it's NASASLS, that's one word.  Or, this is one of the things that actually David Smith wrote.  You can actually search SLS Mission Planner's Guide.  And, it's a document that you can find on the web.  You can download it, and it actually has a lot of great information on just the whole scope of the Space Launch System.  We're really looking forward to the first launch of SLS and Orion from the Kennedy in a couple years.  Sounds like we're well on our way to the pad, and we'll be launching astronauts back to the moon in just a few short years.  If you have questions on SLS and its development, use the hashtag asknasa on your favorite platform.  Just go to the Johnson accounts.  Those are the ones we look at.   The NASA Johnson Space Center accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.  You can send an idea or a question, and we'll make sure to mention it's for, or just make sure to mention it's for Houston, We Have a Podcast, and we'll bring it up in a later episode.  Or, maybe address it in an entire episode.  The whole episode will be dedicated to the question.  Who knows?  So, this podcast was recorded on March 20, 2018.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, Rachel Craft, Laura Reshawn [assumed spelling], Kelly Humphries, Pat Ryan, Tyler Martin, Bev Perry, and all the folks at the Marshall Spaceflight Center for coming on to help to put this together.  Thanks again to Dr. Paul Bookout and Mr. David Smith for coming on the show.  We'll be back next week with part two.",

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 69: Navigating Deep Space.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  On this podcast, we bring in the experts.  NASA scientists, engineers, and astronauts.  All to let you know the cool stuff about what's going on right here at NASA.  So if you're familiar with us, you may have heard our episode on space communication networks.  It was Episode 26: Can you hear me now?  With Bill Foster, a ground controller.  It was a really good conversation.  And it was a nice overview on how space communication networks work in general.  Especially with day-to-day operations on the International Space Station.  But today we're focusing how space communications will work on missions out in deep space.  We're talking with Greg Holt, Orion Navigation Lead here at NASA's Johnson Space Center.  We talked about how Orion, NASA's deep space vehicle, will communicate with Mission Control.  All the way from the moon and beyond.  And also what happens if a primary communication system fails.  So with no further delay, let's jump right ahead to our talk with Dr. Greg Holt.  Enjoy.    [ Music ]    Host: Thank you for coming on the podcast today, Greg.  Nice to have you here.    Dr. Greg Holt: Great to be here, Gary.  Thanks.    Host: I love this topic of communication and navigation too.  Because a lot of the space movies today.  You see them, and there's always something that goes wrong in the space movie.  It's, it makes for a great narrative.  It makes for a great story.  But it's always that lack of communication.  And oh no!  I'm an astronaut, I'm by myself now.  It's that sort of thing.  And so this is an interesting topic on to see how this is going to work.  Because we're talking about Orion.  And we're talking about deep space today.  So let's just kind of start with that.  Let's talk with, we're talking about navigation.  We're talking about communication with a deep space craft.  How does basic communication and navigation with the spacecraft work?    Dr. Greg Holt: So that's a great question.  And you know we've all seen those same movies.  And us and the crew.  And so we also spend a lot of time sitting around thinking about what do we do to make sure we don't lose communication?  And then boy on those very bad days when we do, what is the crew supposed to do about it?    Host: Right.    Dr. Greg Holt: But you know on a normal day out in deep space, we're normally talking through.  As you mentioned, there's a Deep Space Network out there.  That's managed by our colleagues over at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.  And they've been, had that running for decades now.  And use it for a variety of interplanetary spacecraft.  And so once we really get outside of our comfort zone around kind of lower-earth orbit.  That Deep Space Network becomes our lynchpin for communication out there.    Host: So there's several space networks then.  There's the Deep Space Network which is communicating with all these different robotic probes that we have all across the solar system.  And that's the primary, I guess network that we're using for those, right?  But there's one that exists around here.  What's, what's going on around earth?    Dr. Greg Holt: There is.  There's a Near Earth Network.  And that consists of a number of ground-based dishes that communicate with satellites in low-earth orbit.  And then of course there's the TDRS or the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite constellation.  That is up in a geosynchronous orbit that's also communicating with satellites that are in the proximity of earth.  In that near, low-earth orbit area.  But again, once you get outside there, you're really back on the Deep Space Network.  And you have to use those bigger, more capable dishes to talk out there so.    Host: Right, because those TDRS satellites are geosynchronous, right?  So they're 20--, 22--, 23,000 miles I think away from earth.  So once you, I mean, that's, it sounds pretty far.  You've got a pretty decent snapshot of earth.  But once you cross it, I mean, they're not, they're not talking to that spacecraft.    Dr. Greg Holt: That's right.  And it sounds like a long way.  But when we're zooming, for example, out to the moon.  Really only in contact really for the first 15, 20 minutes or so.  Maybe 30 minutes if we're lucky on the way out.  But then we've really got to start handing over to that Deep Space Network because it's a long way to the moon.  And our, we travel fast, getting through that very first low-earth orbit phase.    Host: Oh wow.  So you're talking about after that, I guess it's called, it's referred to in all the old space movies TLI, right?  Trans-lunar injection?  That's that final burn that gets you, once you're circling earth.    Dr. Greg Holt: You got it.    Host: Boom!  You burn, and you're on your way.  So that's, you say that's about 15, 20 minutes until their trans-lunar injection.  Until bam!  You're, you're passing the TDRS satellites?    Dr. Greg Holt: It's, it's really fast out there.  It's a lot faster than most of us anticipate.    Host: Yeah!    Dr. Greg Holt: And the very first time that we simulate that for all of our ground control folks.  It always catches us by surprise how quickly we zip through the GPS constellation, the TDRS constellation.  We're just going through all of those.  And we're really out there on our own.  Having to look back at the Deep Space Network in very short order so.    Host: So what's the GPS constellation?  Is that, is that another network?    Dr. Greg Holt: Yeah, that's Global Positioning System. They’re the same satellites that you communicate with like your, your car or your smartphone.    Host: Oh, we all need that.    Dr. Greg Holt: Exactly.  That at that we receive, we receive that signal from those Global Positioning satellites.  Lets us navigate our cars all over the place.  Tell us exactly where we are when we're carrying our phones around.  We could use that.  Of course, our spacecraft as well when we're relatively close to the earth.  But once we, again, get too far away.  Then that Global Positioning System also is out of range.  And we've really got to go back to some of the more old-school methods of navigation using radio signals.  And as you'll talk about, even some star, star sightings, things of that nature.    Host: Oh, radio signals.  I want to definitely get into that.  That'd be pretty cool.  So these networks.  We have, we have GPS, we have TDRS, Deep Space Network.  Do we have complete control over these networks?  Or is this a shared resource?    Dr. Greg Holt: You know, all of those are really shared resources.  And the, both the, especially the Near Earth Network is shared amongst a lot of users.  Both from a NASA standpoint.  And Department of Defense all kind of shares that resources.  And both contribute to its upkeep.  And so we do have to share that resource quite a bit.  The Deep Space Network is mainly NASA projects on there.  But again, there's enough of them they al-- that also has to be shared and scheduled quite a bit in advance.  And so lots of times we'll have to schedule that months in advance.  In fact, that time to be on the Deep Space Network just because there's so many probes.  There's New Horizon's out at Pluto.  And there's other probes at Mars.  And there's other vehicles near the sun.  They're all wanting to communicate with that Deep Space Network.  And so we have to schedule that resource well in advance.  And we try to be collegial about it.  And make sure that we respect when everybody has critical science going on.  Versus obviously for a human spaceflight vehicle, we want to make sure that we have good coverage with our vehicle.  Keep it safe, so.    Host: That's right because obviously, if you're flying Orion, you want communication with Orion.  But that doesn't mean you're going to completely dominate all the communication and nobody else can talk to their spacecraft.  Because everyone's, everyone's got stuff going on.    Dr. Greg Holt: You're exactly right.  And in general, when we have people onboard, we tend to get a little bit higher priority.  But we try not to abuse that.  Because we again, we realize the Deep Space Network is a shared asset.  And we want, you know, we want to make sure that we're not adversely affecting.  The science payloads and the rovers and the unmanned probes out there.  As, as much as possible.    Host: Okay.  So when it comes to deep space craft, I guess.  We’ll talk about Orion.  But when it comes to communication and navigation.  What are you looking for?  What kind of data are we looking at?  Why do we want to communicate?    Dr. Greg Holt: So communication and navigation interestingly are pretty interdependent functions.  They're, you know separate but they're, but they're very related and interdependent.  One of the reasons is that they both use the same radio signal to accomplish their task.  So that same radio signal that we're using to talk to the spacecraft, get data from the spacecraft.  We're also, we're also encoding navigation information on that radio signal and using it to actually locate the spacecraft as well.  So it's kind of a, it's kind of a two-fer.  We get to piggyback one function on another.  But for that reason, they become very, very related and interdependent.  And obviously the importance of being able to communicate with the spacecraft is we want to be able to talk to the crew.  And make sure they can talk back to the ground for the normal interactions that we need to have with them.  We also need to make sure of course we're getting data back from the vehicle.   And all the telemetry on all the systems.  So that the ground controllers and Mission Control can look at the spacecraft systems.  Make sure they're all functioning properly.  And then one of the last and most, what I think is one of the more important things, is we want to make sure we get some cool pictures down from the spacecraft.  Because you know we've got a very unique spacecraft out there in a region of space where we haven't been in a very long time.  So getting some cool, some cool videos down from around the moon.  I think is a pretty good task, too.    Host: Definitely looking forward to those pictures.  For sure.  Especially if they're high resolution, too.  Are we looking at that?    Dr. Greg Holt: We are.  So right now the system that we've got, for example, on Orion.  Gives us about two, two megabits per second at its highest rate.  So that's, that's plenty good for some compressed HD video.  That takes about one and a half megabits.  So, so in our, when we've got the times allocated for it and the time slots, we'll turn those HD cameras on and get some really cool shots, I think.  Coming, coming to us from the vicinity of the moon.  And we've got some unique cameras at different locations around the Orion spacecraft, out on the tips of the solar rays that can swivel around and take some neat shots of the spacecraft out there, while it's navigating to and from the moon.    Host: Now I'm thinking about it, just from watching it on TV.  How pretty it's going to look.  But I'm sure that there's an engineering part to that, too.  As a, as a, you're saying you've got folks on the ground that are receiving this telemetry and data about the spacecraft.  Numbers can tell you so much.  But a good picture can probably tell you a decent amount as an engineer, too.    Dr. Greg Holt: It does.  And not only does it tell us about the health of the spacecraft.  But it also, especially for the first couple of flights, gives us some really good engineering data about what's going on with the spacecraft.  And if there's anything that we need to look at either tweaking the design or even fixing the design for future missions.  So for example, we see that one side of the spacecraft isn't, isn't behaving well.  Or the, we're getting back pictures that show that we didn't separate cleanly from some piece of the spacecraft where we were supposed to have a separation event.  Then we'll go back and look at that picture in excruciating detail.  And watch that video in super slow motion thousands of time and make sure that we really understand what was going on.  And what we need to, what we need to tweak in the design.    Host: Yeah, so that's when that higher resolution and that the more data you're getting, the better your assessment can be.  Because the more you can see and play with that footage.  So that's always good.  You were talking about radio signals and, and it being kind of sharing this, this feature of communication and navigation.  Interdependent but two separate things.  Navigation, I don't think we've actually dove into navigation too much on the podcast before.  So, so how does a, how does a spacecraft navigate?  How does it know where to go?    Dr. Greg Holt: Very good question, and the answer really depends on where you are relative to the earth.  So right when we're sitting on the pad, obviously, we have a really good idea of where we are.  Because.    Host: Well, you can see it.  [Laughter]    Dr. Greg Holt: We can see it, and it's sitting right there on the pad.  And so at that point, we have absolute certainty of where the vehicle is.    Host: Cool.    Dr. Greg Holt: But then once we, once we get launched and get further up and then get into our low earth orbit, that's where we really lean heavily on Global Positioning Systems.  So that GPS signal just like you get in your car, your smartphone.  And it's, like I said, it works really well when you're close to the earth.  And we have four antennas and two GPS receivers on Orion.  And we get really good signal there.  And we have a really good idea of where Orion is.  But then after we do that, the big, the big burn.  The, the TLI, trans-lunar injection you were talking about.  We zip out rapidly past that GPS constellation there.  It's only about 12 and a half thousand miles out there.  So really again, we're zipping past it in the first few minutes of the outbound trajectory on the way to the moon.  And then we have to switch to, like I said, some of the more old-school methods of navigation.  And so this is where we go back to using those encoded radio sig-- encoded information on the radio signals to, to navigate.  Just we did back in the Apollo days.   And then they still use that today for deep space probes.  So that method of navigating using that encoded information on the radio signal has actually been refined very well by our JPL colleagues out there since Apollo.  And so we're going to take full advantage of course of all the advancements that they've made.  Both in the ground-side equipment and the onboard radio transponder equipment.  Over the past couple of decades.  And really gives us a nice modern communication system with upgraded avionics compared to Apollo that makes our job just that much easier.  Navigating the spacecraft and telling where it is from the ground.  By looking at the signature of those radio signals.    Host: Yeah, so it sounds like, I mean, the, for that little while that the spacecraft is actually close to earth, GPS.  It sounds like when it comes to navigation, you're talking about GPS.  You're talking about radio.  But really the theme here is that you really want to know the location of, of the spacecraft.  Is that, is that like the main component of understanding how navigation works?  Is understanding where the spacecraft is?    Dr. Greg Holt: That's one part of it.  But the other important parts from our prospective not only is where is the spacecraft.  But what direction is it going and how fast?  So the spacecraft's velocity is very important to us.  And then the spacecraft's orientations.  All three of those play into the navigator's job of keeping track of where it is, where it's going, what direction it's pointing.  And how all of those things affect.  So we go to great lengths to estimate all those things continuously during the mission so that we can always be prepared.  To supply that information to the folks who are calculating the burns, for example.  All the maneuvering burns at so that they know which direction that we need to do course corrections.  All those things rely fundamentally on that navigation.  Knowing where the vehicle is, its velocity and its orientation so that we can do all the fancy math behind the scenes that gets us where we need to go.    Host: So I think when it comes to navigating a craft in space.  It's not like what you see in sci-fi movies where there's someone with a joystick and they're just kind of weaving in and out of space, right?  I think this, when it comes to deep space navigation.  A lot of it is preplanned.  So it's, it's knowing the velocity at this point in the trajectory, in the mission.  It's supposed to be going this fast at this place and oriented this way.  Is that kind of how that works?    Dr. Greg Holt: Very much.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Greg Holt: We plan a lot of that ahead of time.  And we have a very detailed reference trajectory before we ever start the mission.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Greg Holt: But inevitably, especially with a crew vehicle.  You're going to slightly get off of that preplanned reference trajectory due to things.  You know, all of the events that happen onboard, especially a spacecraft with a crew.  The crew is constantly breathing for example.  And that's a good thing.  We like the crew to breath.  But that also means that carbon dioxide and things are constantly being vented overboard.  We have things such as water and urine dumps that we have to deal with.  So a lot of things that for example, that robotic spacecraft don't have to deal with.  For a vehicle with people inside, we do have to deal with these, these events, these overboard events that do perturb the trajectory slightly.  And so we have to keep track of those things.  And that's a lot of what our job is as navigators on, for human spaceflight missions.  Is that we're constantly keeping track of these small perturbations that accumulate over the course of the trajectory.  And then using that to help feed that into what we need to do.  As far as make course correction burns to get us back on track and keep us on, keep us on the mission.    Host: Knowing, yeah.  Knowing the navigation where you're supposed to be at what time.  But I guess another thing, another consideration is, is fuel and thrust, you know?  You can't just be firing the jets all the time.  You have a certain amount of fuel for these deep space missions that, that you have.    Dr. Greg Holt: It is, and we have those preplanned points usually during the trajectory where we have those mid-course corrections sort of scripted into the mission, if you will.  Such that every so often we will evaluate how we're doing.  Based on all of those navigation measurements that we've taken to that point.  And say okay, it looks like we're off by this much.  So we need to correct our trajectory back by this much.  We'll prescribe a burn.  We'll upload that to the vehicle.  And the crew will monitor it as it goes, as it happens.    Host: So that's kind of interesting that just venting CO2 or if you need to go to bathroom and you need to let go some of the urine, right?  That's Orion.  Orion's not going to use this water recycling system.  You're just going to dump it overboard.  But just that little bit is enough to push a spacecraft.  That's just amazing how that, how space works like that.    Dr. Greg Holt: It is.  And again, we, we love having humans on board spacecraft.  But from a navigator's prospective, sometimes we pull our hair out because those are the things that we have to deal with.  Is these, all these little overboard dumps really cause these perturbations to accumulate.  And we have to cause our job of keeping track of a vehicle to be that much more challenging.    Host: So another thing you were talking about was, was orientation of the spacecraft.  Again, I'm, I, I keep thinking about sci-fi movies here.  But you're not talking about a spacecraft just kind of zipping through.  You don't really have to deal with aerodynamics as much like a plains is shaped away.  Because you're flying through the air.  This one, you can sort of face in any direction.  But I'm sure there's some strategy on which direction you want to be facing.  So what's the orientation of the spacecraft when it's flying?    Dr. Greg Holt: So we have a lot of different orientations that we use.  And we'll use different, different prescribed orientations of the vehicle for different purposes.  And one of the ones that we like for Orion specifically is what's called that tail to sun orientation or attitude.    Host: Tail to sun.  Dr. Greg Holt: And that's where we basically turn the vehicle around, point the back end right there at the sun.  So that lines up our solar rays right there at the sun.  Gives us nice, good power consumption.  Keeps the, all the components at just about the right thermal, thermal temperature, balance.  So we have some electronics are a little bit more sensitive to temperature than others so that tail to sun orientation or attitude, as we call it.  Keeps those, keeps the hot things hot.  Keeps the cool things cool.  And keeps the solar rays pointed right there where we get good power generation and distribution throughout the vehicle.    Host: So that's a key component of orientation is not, you're not pointing where you want to be flying.  You're pointing to where you're getting a good amount of power consumption.  But also you're protecting the systems from the intense, I guess thermal constraints of space.  It's super hot when the sun is shining on it.  And in the shade it can be super cold.    Dr. Greg Holt: That's right.  And we use, we have two star trackers on the vehicle that help us determine which direction the vehicle is pointing.  So they're actually constantly looking out at stars.  Recognizing the different stars and the different constellations and orientations.  And constantly computing automatically on board what the, what direction the vehicle is pointing.  And we're constantly feeding that to our guidance navigation and control system on board.  Which is actively keeping the vehicle oriented just in the direction that we prescribe.  So it's a fairly complicated feedback loop of things that have to happen just to keep the vehicle pointed in one direction.  But-- .    Host: Wow. Yeah, I guess that's true, right?  Because if, if I'm in my car, I want to turn left.  I know that I'm going to orient.  I'm going to turn the wheel, the car's going to go left.  But this all different directions in space.  So the place that you want to orient is based on where the stars are.    Dr. Greg Holt: Exactly.  Host: So you have to know where the stars are going to be at this time in this place.  And which way-- wow.  That's so interesting.  They're looking at the stars.    Dr. Greg Holt: We really are.  That's the, we're getting back to some of the more old-school methods of navigation once you get beyond, too far beyond earth orbit there, you really have to use the stars to figure out your orientation.  And then the stars of course become important if you happen to lose communication.  And that radio link with the earth.  That's, the stars become the only way to know where you are.    Host: Yeah, so that's, that's the orientation.  That's the method we use for orientation is, is knowing the stars.  You talked about old-school method of, of radio.  And that being a way to, to navigate the spacecraft past whenever we're past the GPS constellation.  So how does that work?  How does a radio communication work?    Dr. Greg Holt: So that's that, where I was talking about, we put that signal onto the communication link.  So the communication link for Orion operates on an S-Band radio frequency.  And so what we'll do is we'll encode some navigation information onto the S-Band radio signal.  And it's transparent to the vehicle.  It just goes back and forth.  But on the ground, we can actually take that signal and do some special post-processing to it.  And actually extract a measurement from that.  So it actually measures you know the range to the vehicle or the relative velocity of the vehicle to that receiving dish.  And so we can actually then take those measurements and plug those into our navigation filters and estimate where the vehicle is and what its velocity is.  Just based on that information that's encoded on the radio signal.    Host: Wow, but it's obviously pretty reliable because we've had spacecraft like you said.  All over the solar system, flying in all different directions and going exactly where they need to go.  So it's, so it's a pretty reliable navigation tool.    Dr. Greg Holt: It is, and that's been around really since the early days of human spaceflight.  So even all the way back to the very first satellite in fact, Sputnik.  They were able to track its radio signal and do some very crude post-processing on it.  And figure out its velocity and orbit within a few hours.  Some of the, some of the first folks that tracked that.  Of course the Mercury and Gemini flights refined that.  And then the Apollo engineers designed the, the universal S-Band system specifically for Apollo.  They had all of those pieces.  The communication navigation all integrated together into one nice, tight little package.  And really did a great job for them.  And really was kind of the precursor to all of the modern communication navigation equipment that we use today on spacecraft.    Host: Wow, you're not kidding when you say old school.  You're talking about using radio as navigation from the first steps of space flight in general.    Dr. Greg Holt: Absolutely.    Host: Wow, that's some significant stuff.  From what you're, from what you're talking about.  When it comes to navigating a spacecraft.  It seems like a lot of it is done with computers and a lot of it is done and monitored on the ground.  How much are the crew doing?  They're not really, it doesn't sound like they're doing a lot of flying.    Dr. Greg Holt: So that's a good point.  During the, the normal course of the mission.  They're obviously just sort of keeping track where the vehicle is.  They're up, they're usually very curious to know how far away am I from earth?  How far do I have to go to the moon?  So those type of questions always come up and so we keep that navigation information handy for them.  But primarily the, the navigation function is accomplished on the ground.  Because we have those measurements taken from the radio signal.  And of course we have the computers that actually crunch the numbers and figure out where they are.  Where the crew does come into play though is if we do happen to lose communication with the ground.  And that's where we spend a lot of our time and effort thinking about those bad-day scenarios.  But you know that's the, the type of things that we have to think through and what is the crew supposed to do if they lose communication with the ground?  That radio signal is obviously not there.  So that's where we have to fall to our, to our backup systems of navigation.  That are completely self-contained on board the vehicle.  And that's where they use things such as our optical navigation camera.  And some of these back-up systems where in the, the very unlikely event that we should lose communication with the ground.  We don't want the crew to be stranded and have no hope of getting back.  So we include those, we have those back-up systems.  We train them how to use them.  And that's where the crew becomes super involved and very interested in making sure the spacecraft is navigated correctly.    Host: Okay.  So, so they're not, they don't have their hands at a joystick.  And they're not flying left and right.  They're really just kind of monitoring things.  And you guys are, too.  As long as everything is going according to plan.    Dr. Greg Holt: Right.    Host: Their expertise is when stuff goes wrong.    Dr. Greg Holt: Exactly.    Host: And you talked about optical navigation.  Is it, I mean, you, if, I'm thinking orientation.  I'm thinking about the stars.  How, how do they optically navigate?  How does that work?    Dr. Greg Holt: So this is probably taking it even one more step back into the old school where we've lost that radio link, as I mentioned.  And, and now we have to really navigate by the stars.  And this is going, you know, Christopher Columbus type old school where you have to literally take sightings of the stars.  Sightings of the moon.  Measure angles between them.  And try to deduce from those measurements and triangulate your position in the earth-moon space.  And so it gets from a navigator's perspective, it's very cool and exciting because you know that's a, that's a neat way to navigate.    Host: Yeah, it's pretty cool.    Dr. Greg Holt: But it, it definitely requires some more, some trickier math and some trickier vehicle design to pull that off.  So we have a camera that does that automatically.  And so if they do lose communication with the ground.  That camera system kicks in.  Starts taking pictures of the moon and stars.  And automatically deducing where it is based on the size of the, relative size of the moon.  Where it is in relation to the background stars.  Because the stars can be considered like a fixed target.  And then the moon is kind of moving around as you navigate to and from the moon.  The moon will appear to move around against the fixed background of stars.  So you can infer where you are based on using some really, like I said, some old school triangulation methods.  To, to get you where your, your position and velocity and continue to navigate the spacecraft.  And pull off those midcourse maneuvers and things that you need.  To actually get you back safely.    Host: Oh, okay.  So, so they're not really busting out the old Christopher Columbus, I forget what the device is called, a sextant device?  What's the, the little navigation thing?    Dr. Greg Holt: Right, right, So those, those old mechanical instruments that you see?  Well, truth be told as an emergency backup.  We at least have it on the, we're evaluating it right now.  That in a really, really bad day situation.    Host: If the back-up fails.    Dr. Greg Holt: Where they might, they will potentially carry one of those along as well.  We actually have an experiment on International Space Station right now.  Where the crew is actually has a sextant up there.  A real marine sextant.  Just like you would see out at sea today.  And they are practicing taking measurements from the International Space Station.  And they're really doing a great job.  Matter of fact, I was just on the, on the loops with them this morning.  I was talking with, with the crew members up there.  Coaching them through a session of taking sextant measurements out the, out the window.  And they're really doing a great job.  They, they actually really like it.  It's, it's really, I think they feel a kind of a connection to some of the old-school techniques there.  In some of the, the ghosts of the sailors past whispering over their shoulder to, helping them make, helping them make good measurements.    Host: Yeah, you feel like a classic explorer.    2 >> Indeed.  Indeed.  But you know it's, it's interesting.  It's an interesting concept because you know it's one of those situations that you, you don't want to, you hope never happens.  But you know in a, in a very bad-day scenario where your computers are down.  And, and a lot of your back-up systems have failed.  It's nice in a, for a last-ditch emergency to just to have a nice, solid mechanical piece of equipment that doesn't require a fancy computer or anything like that, that you can just pull out and at least keep track of where you are.  And give yourself a fighting chance to get back home.    Host: Yeah.  That's crazy.  A back-up to a back-up.  Because you had this system that does a lot of, even, even in the case where you would lose that navigation ability.  You do have a back-up.  Then you have a back-up to that.  That's pretty crazy.  Now in this, in this scenario where they lose, in the first one.  Where they lose communication and they're using this back-up system that automatically detects where they are.  Are they sending the commands?  Or in this scenario, do they still have communication with the ground?  And communicating where and when to fire things?    Dr. Greg Holt: So this is a situation where we have lost communication with the ground.  So the, the onboard systems now are taking those pictures.  Continuing to navigate completely within the vehicle.  So not relying on any external assets there.  So we're just relying on those photos that we're taking to determine where the vehicle is and where it's going.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Greg Holt: And then the vehicle also has the onboard targeting systems to take that navigation solution.  And turn that into a burn to get them back on course.  To get them back to earth.  So again, a lot of that is all scripted and happens automatically.    Host: Cool.    Dr. Greg Holt: But when communication with the ground is lost.  There's nobody on the ground monitoring to make sure all of that is working correctly.  So that's where the crew member comes in.  They now take over the function of watching all of those automating systems.  Making sure that they're all behaving correctly.  Doing their job correctly.  And that if anything, if it throws any warning flags or has any problems.  They're the ones who have to go in and diagnose and fix things.  And so that's where we spend a lot of our time training the crew.  Making them aware of what to look for.  When these automated functions are occurring.  They have to have the expertise to monitor them.  And go in and take action if there's, if there's a problem.    Host: Wow, that's, that seems to be a theme when it comes to crew training is you know what happens when something goes wrong?  You've got to know.  And that's, like you said,  if you're spending a lot of time on it.  And that's, that's the truth because when it comes down to it.  When it comes down to crunch time.  You know, something goes wrong, we have to make sure we're going the right direction.  That is extremely important because you're on your own.  You've got to have that baseline knowledge.  You don't have, you can't just you know, search it up.  Or call someone on the ground.  Like you have to know.    Dr. Greg Holt: It is.  And like I say, we—it seems like we spend an inordinate amount out of time thinking through these scenarios and preparing the crew for when we lose communication.  But it, it's, it's a big enough deal and it's a big enough concern to the crew.  Because that's a, just thinking from a psychological point of view.  That's a, that's a pretty, pretty harrowing experience to have to go through.  To lose your safety net.  Your communication signal with the ground.  The ability to talk to someone and understand that you're still on track.  And everything's okay.  And so that, that not being there is a really, a big psychological hit to the crew.  So the more that we can prepare them to understand if you lose communication with the ground, you can still look here and monitor everything.  See that you're still on, on good trajectory.  You're still going to make your entry corridor and everything's going to be okay.  You know, that's a big, that's a big deal.  Not just you know from a mission success standpoint.  But also from a psychological standpoint for the crew.    Host: Yeah, for sure.  I'm thinking about some of the first missions of, of Orion, EM-1, EM-2.  I'm thinking about those mission profiles.  And I know Orion is going to be sent.  Those missions are, are to the moon, right?    Dr. Greg Holt: Right.  Host: So, so you're going to be going that way.  Trans-lunar injection.  That's why it's called that, so you can go around the moon.  Now from what I understand from Apollo missions.  Once you get behind the moon, that's where communication gets a little bit tricky.  I think you lose communications.  Is that part of the mission plan?    Dr. Greg Holt: We do lose communication briefly and that's expected.    Host: I see.    Dr. Greg Holt: And so we plan ahead of time that we're going to have a few minutes of brief communication outage behind the moon.  The unfortunate thing, at least from our flight-controller ground perspective is that a lot of critical events are happening during that very brief time.    Host: Really?  Dr. Greg Holt: And that's just, just the way that the orbital mechanics work out.  Host: Okay.  Dr. Greg Holt: So for example, some of our-- if we're trying to, if for example insert into a, a big halo orbiter distant retrograde orbit around the moon, we have to execute that burn just in that spot where we have that lost communication.  Right behind the moon.  And so we don't get to monitor that burn and monitor the telemetry and the data from that burn in real time.  We have to wait until the burn happens.  And then we see it come out from behind the moon.  We get our data and telemetry back and then we can tell after the fact.  Whether the burn worked or not.  But we don't actually get to see it right during, during the burn.  So that gets a little bit of, a little bit of a harrowing time.  And that's where it's nice to have a crew onboard.  They can be obviously right there monitoring the burn.  If there's any problems that happen during the burn, they can take immediate action.  As opposed to the ground.  Which won't be able to see the burn or take action until many minutes later.    Host: So in this, in this scenario, you're going behind the moon.  You're doing that burn.  Is that, is that burn to circle around the moon and come back?  Or what, what's, what's happening in the, in the mission profile?  Where's it going?    Dr. Greg Holt: So that's, depends on the, where you're, if you're going inbound or outbound.  So on the way out, we're generally trying to capture into some sort of a lunar orbit so we can stay there for, for a little while and conduct the mission.  And so that first burn is usually to capture you into lunar orbit.    Host: And that happens behind the moon?    Dr. Greg Holt: Right.  That happens behind the moon.  And then at the end of the mission, when it's time to come home.  We do kind of a reverse where we come back.  But again, we have to do another burn to get us back on a trajectory back to the earth.    Host: Behind the moon.    Dr. Greg Holt: Again, behind the moon and--   Host: I'm seeing a theme here.    Dr. Greg Holt: The poor crew has to again, has to pull that one off or at least monitor it on their own.  We precalculate it on the ground and get everything set up for them.  But you know they're, they have to monitor it on the ground.  I mean on the spacecraft.  And then the ground will pick them up on, on the flipside when they come out on the side of the moon.  And do a quick radio track from the Deep Space Network.  And confirm that everything went off okay.  And give them, give them the go to continue on home.    Host: Wow, no kidding, important stuff going on behind the moon there.  Wow.  Yeah, so definitely something that you want to know.  But it sounds like when you, when you come around the moon, you understand, based on whenever you get that signal back.  It went successfully or it did not go successfully.  Are you getting some-- is it recording data behind the moon, moon too?  So that whenever you regain communication, you can understand exactly what happened?    Dr. Greg Holt: Yes, absolutely.  So we, we have our data recorders going the whole time.  Once we get back communications, we'll set up a, just a file transfer link.  And record all that data down to the ground.  Double check and make sure that the burn executed successfully.  But you know, one of the very first and early indications that we get.  And even the Apollo guys used this trick.  Is actually just monitoring what time we get communication back.  So you know our, our flight dynamics officers there in Mission Control are, are so good at their job.  They can usually predict down to the second or two when we're going to get communication back.  So if the burn didn't go exactly as planned.  It was either didn't, it was either too cold or too hot, didn't add enough energy or added too much.  The communication will even hap, the return of communication will either happen too early or too late.  And so if we're, if we're a little early getting communication back or a little late getting communication back.  Then that'll give us a very first heads-up.  Hey, something didn't go right with that burn.  But if we get it back right on time, that at least gives us our, our very first indication.  Yep, we're right, right on the money.  We got comm back right when we expected.  And then like I said, we'll do a quick radio track just to confirm.  But.    Host: Yeah.  So it sounds like for, for a lot of this you, in, in your position, are you working pretty closely with the operations folks?  And because it sounds like a lot of this is, is dealing with, you know, operate, operating the spacecraft.  And understanding the navigation of, of yeah, the mission itself.    Dr. Greg Holt: It is, and we have a really great team here that is participating in both the design and the operations of Orion.   Host: I see. Okay.  Dr. Greg Holt: And we work very closely together on a daily basis, really.  Because we're very sensitive to the fact as vehicle designers that the folks who operate this vehicle are going to have to know exactly what to do with it.  And so we try to do design operability into the vehicle wherever we can.  And of course they're, as operators, they're sensitive to the fact that they want all the bells and whistles on, on a vehicle.  And we, we always have to be sensitive to how much, how much mass everything adds to the vehicle.  How much power it consumes.  And so we have to play that balancing game between, you know, both the crew.  And, and the flight controllers.  You know, want the, the greatest gee-whiz system they can, they can put on there.  Which is great.  But weighs a million pounds and.  [Laughter]  And consumes, you know, thousand watts of power.  And so we can't, sorry we can't, can't put all that on there.  So we, we do have to play those, those system trade games to make sure that we have a vehicle that's, that's operable and the crew can understand.  But still can get off the launchpad so.    Host: Right, yeah.  Orion would be pretty huge if everyone got what they wanted.  Right?  So alright.  So let's talk about Orion itself.  You know, when it comes to the navigation and communication systems that's on there.  What's happening?  Where is it in its construction?  In its design?  Especially for the EM-1 crew module and, and everything that's going on there?    Dr. Greg Holt: So we've got really communication and navigation equipment sort of scattered all around the vehicle.    Host: Oh really?  Dr. Greg Holt: So the we have antennas sort of distributed all around.  We have a handful of antennas around the, the capsule.  The cone shape in the front.  And then we have more antennas around the, the service module in the back.  And these are what we call phased array antennas as our primary communication system.  And so they actually have active electronics that will steer and shape that, the beam from the, from the antenna.  So it actually shapes that antenna pattern just the right direction that we want it to maximize that bandwidth.  As we're, as we're flying along and orienting the spacecraft in different directions.  The beam will actually use those electronics to steer the beam over to just the right spot on earth.  And, and really get us those high bandwidths that I was talking about that gives us the cool HD video and all that.  And so those, those antennas are kind of a, the tip of the spear when it comes to the to the communications system.  And then of course that all feeds down into the guts of the communication equipment where we have baseband processors.  And then our S-Band transponders.  That actually do the processing of the signal.  And puts all that data and telemetry on there.  And of course the crew voice and the video.  All the great information that we want to get down.  It has to all get mixed together into that radio signal and sent out those antennas down to the ground.  To be picked up by the Deep Space Network dishes.  And then routed ultimately to Mission Control.  Or to wherever we need to, that information to go.    Host: Wow.  So there, I mean, when it comes to designing and where they're going to be.  Like you said, they're all over.  I know the ESA, European Space Agency is working on the service module.  If I'm, if I'm not mistaken and the crew module's somewhere else.  So they have to talk to each other.  They have to make sure everything works.  I guess we'll start with the mission itself.  In the mission, how long are the crew module and the service module together throughout the whole mission?    Dr. Greg Holt: So they're together for most of the mission in fact.   Host: Really? Okay.  Dr. Greg Holt: So all the way through.  Obviously they're mated together early on in the process.  Before it ever gets attached to the, to the booster and get rolled out to the pad.  For the entire mission all the way to the moon and back, that service module's attached.  Providing power, and consumables to the vehicle.  And it will really only detach the, the crew module from the service module for the last 20 minutes or so of the flight.  So right before we re-enter the atmosphere.  We will detach, and then the crew module itself will reorient.  And that's the only part that comes back and is the recovered part that has the crew inside, of course.  And survives the re-entry and splashes down for recovery.  The service module just burns up in the atmosphere as it comes back.  But for the majority of the mission, we have that service module attached.  And we take advantage of that, of course.  Like I said because we have antennas on there that we can use to talk to the ground.  We have our nice solar rays there that provide us the power.  We have fuel tanks and the like there that provide us fuel.  And of course we have our big orbital maneuvering system engine on the service module as well.  So it's, it really is sort of a workhorse for us while we're up there.  And we only separate from it at the very last minute.    Host: Right.  It's, I mean, all the, seems like a lot of the, a lot of the efforts of the mission itself are, are coming from the service module.  You've got the fuel, the things that's actually orienting you.  Point, pointing you where you want to go.  That's all important stuff.    Dr. Greg Holt: It is.  It is.  But the, the bulk of the avionics.  And like I was saying before, the communication, navigation equipment.  That all has to be there up there in the crew module.  Because we, we still need that after we separate and want to come back.  So our GPS receivers.  Our inertial measurement units.  Which include our accelerometer and gyroscopes.  And you know a lot of the other, like I said, communication, navigation gear.  Are all housed up in that command module, the crew module so that we can hang onto that after we separate.  And use that to help us navigate during the entry phase as well.  We still have to be able to fly the vehicle down and get it now, get it to where we go for splashdown.    Host: Wow.  Seems like the communication and navigation system just in general consists of a lot of components.  You're, you're listing all these different things that have to talk to each other in order to make this thing successful.  How many of them?  It sounds like a lot of them are, are proven.  Used before technologies?  How many of them are, are in this scenario?  And then how many of them are, are more novel, newer technology?    Dr. Greg Holt: It's, a, it's a mix.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Greg Holt: We obviously try to lean on the, the time-tested and proven methods for kind of our primary systems.    Host: Yeah. Of course.    Dr. Greg Holt: And obviously crew safety's a big consideration so we, we want to try to, try to stick with things that we know or at least have high confidence that will work.  So these S-Band radio signals through the Deep Space Network are, are tried and true.  And so we, we use those for the primary communication and navigation.  When we're navigating to, to the moon and back.  Global Positioning System, obviously's been out there for a long time now, since the eighties.  And everybody, like I said, uses it in their car and smartphones.  And does a great job telling us where we are.  So those systems have been around for a while.  And we, and we trust those pretty well.  Some of those, the new, the new back-up systems is where we get into some of the more experimental things.  So the optical navigation system, for example, is, is brand-new.  It's a brand-new technology that we developed just for Orion to have that back-up capability and navigate to the moon and back.  If we happen to lose communication.  So the other new technology that we're working on now is even an optical communication system that uses, uses lasers instead of radio to communicate.  So it's, the example I like to give is like the, the, it's the difference between talking on a, on a normal ethernet line and talking on a fiber line.  You just, the bandwidth just [whoosh] skyrockets.  Once you can get that, get that laser column.  So we do have some experiments there on some of the earlier Orion missions.  With a, with some laser communications.  We call it optical communications.  And it, it, it's trickier and it's more experimental.  But once we get the kinks worked out on that, that'll really increase the bandwidth.  And again, allow us to do even more great video and the ability to interact with a vehicle and get a lot more data down as well.    Host: Yeah, and when you talk about bandwidth, you talk about total information that you can deliver at once, right?  So if you can increase that, that's more information that you can put onto the vehicle.  Of course that means mass.  So you know, there's, there's that consideration too.  But still, I mean my hope as, as the public affairs guy is like you're, you're just beaming four-K images down.  Now that is my dream.  But I don't know.  That would be pretty cool.  So, so when it comes to these experimental things.  And, and even some of the older proven technologies.  What's being done to test it?  To make sure everything's going to work come mission time?    Dr. Greg Holt: So especially with a crew on board, we have to make sure everything is, is really ship shape.  So we, we do test those out pretty, pretty thoroughly.  We have communication tests that we regularly do between the Orion's equipment and the Deep Space Network.  So the folks at JPL actually have a, a little mobile net, network simulator.  They can send around and go test out your equipment.  They, they provide that to all the, the robotic probes that are going out to the solar system.  They will actually put a little mini-Deep Space Network on a truck and send it out to your assembly facility.  And you can plug in and make sure that your equipment works with the Deep Space Network before you ever leave the ground.  So, so we do that same thing on Orion.  It's really got, kind of neat to see them pull, pull up in their, pull up in their truck with the, with the mini DSN.  And-- .    Host: Mini DSN is a pretty cool thing to have inside of a truck.    Dr. Greg Holt: But yeah, it provides an exact replica of the type of signals that you're going to see.  And so you can test out your actual flight hardware right there on the spot.  Make sure that it's going to work.  And so we, we do those tests.  And I, in addition to obviously testing out all of our navigation equipment.  You know, our global positioning system.  We can test that out.  Obviously, just using the live sky signal, coming from the GPS satellite's broadcast here down to the earth.  We can turn that on and make sure that's all working.  And we test that out on all of our other equipment.  Not only on the, on the hardware side, but the software side.  We run that software through, through millions and millions of different simulations with every different kind of perturbation of failure that we can think of to really wring it out.  And make sure that it's responding correctly in all those situations.    Host: Wow.  So, I mean, when we're talking about Orion and the, and the communication and navigation of this deep space vehicle, it is exactly that.  It's a deep space vehicle.  And obviously we have some missions already planned except for it to go around the moon.  But you know once we do that.  You're talking about something that can go out to, to Mars.  And, and, and even further, further than that.  It's, it's a deep space vehicle.  So once we build this technology and we go through some of these first missions.  How much of it is translatable to just deep space travel?  How much can we take with us to future missions?    Dr. Greg Holt: Quite a bit actually.  And so the good news is we're, we're designing this as a deep space vehicle from, from its conception.  So it has all of the systems that you need to, to go out beyond earth orbit.  Just kind of designed in from, from the start.  So we have all of the, the communication equipment.  So that S-Band communications equipment, the, the locations of the antennas.  All of the redundant features that you need to have ultra, ultra-reliable communication.  Not only to the moon, but beyond.  So all of that compatibility is already built in.  So really from a communications standpoint going to Mars just means you just start using a little bit bigger and bigger dishes on the Deep Space Network.  On the ground side.  The further, the farther that you go out.  And your bandwidth, you'll dial back the bandwidth just a little bit to account for the losses that you get as you're going further and further out.  But the, the fundamental equipment is, is all still there.  And you know really the fundamental navigation doesn't change a whole lot, either.   You're still using that encoded radio signal.  And so you know that's really kind of what, what I like to think sets Orion apart.  Is kind of having that built into the vehicle as you know kind of the first, from a first consideration.  Having all of that capability to communicate and navigate all the way out to the very deep, distant objects.  So you know that same communication nav system that we have going to the moon.  Can take us to Mars.  Can take us to any number of deep space destinations that we've got out there.  And you know, it's, it's not quite.  It, it, it's a little bit of overkill.  If they're just going around, just going up to, to low-earth orbit, for example.  You know, all that equipment and all the redundancy that's built in.  But you know, it's really the only thing that can get you out to those deep space destinations.    Host: Yeah, redundancy is, is a key theme here.  But it's, but it's very exciting how translatable a lot of that is.  Maybe you know small tweaks here and there.  And you can keep increasing reliability but, but the systems, the functions, they're, they're all there.  That's very exciting stuff.  So, so we'll kind of end with that.  Just how exciting this time is.  Looking forward to some of these first mission.  What, what do you really looking forward to, EM-1, EM-2?  The first missions of Orion?    Dr. Greg Holt: Boy, I think seeing those first, those first signals there from Mission Control.  Getting those first navigation measurements back.  And seeing that we're on course.  We're, we're, we're, we're really getting the moon the very first time that we, you know, that we take a pass.  And do a measurement predict and show us heading out to the moon.  Instead of just, instead of just going around the earth.  That's going to be pretty exciting.  That hey!  We're, we're on our way, guys.  It's [laughter], it's show time.    Host: Yeah!  That's going to be a good moment!  When you see everything coming back, and you're like wow!  We are on our way.    Dr. Greg Holt: Absolutely!  And then just like everybody else.  You know, the very first time that we get that, get that HD video down from, from the vicinity of the moon.  And get to see those close-ups there.  And some really cool shots of the moon as we're flying by.  You know, that'll be exciting.    Host: I will definitely be looking forward to that as well.  Greg, thank you so much for coming on!  And sharing this insight into communication and navigation of the deep space spacecraft.    [ Music ]    Host:  Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So today we talked with Dr. Greg Holt.  About the navigation and communication of the Orion spacecraft that'll take us out into deep space.  We've talked about communications before.  Again, check out Episode 26: Can You Hear Me Now?  With Bill Foster.  We've also talked about Orion before.  We gave a nice overview of the spacecraft just in general on Episode 17.  And then we talked about how the crew will operate inside for missions that can go up to three weeks on.  We talked about, I think that's Episode 28, yeah.  What was that?  3 Weeks In a Capsule was the name of that.  And we also take, this one's actually a good one.  A Ride Inside The Capsule for Episode 35.  We talked with Jeff Fox for that one.  And actually brought the audio from the first test mission, EFT-1.  And we brought it onto the podcast.  So you can actually just kind of sit back and imagine what it's like to take off and to land and splashdown from, in the Orion spacecraft.  You can go to NASA.gov/orion to learn more.  They have a great article that released recently, Top Five Technologies Needed for a Spacecraft to Survive Deep Space.  Navigation is one of those.  So you go and read a little bit more there.  Otherwise, you can follow us on social media.  We're at the International Space Station, Orion, or the NASA Johnson Space Center accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 121, Apollo 17. I'm Gary Jordan. I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, and astronauts all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. We are in the middle of celebrating 50 years of the Apollo program. This summer 2019, we focused on Apollo 11, as we passed 50 years since the first landing of humans on the Moon. Just recently, we passed 50 years since Apollo 12, where Pete Conrad and Alan Bean became the next two men on the Moon on November 19th, 1969, while Richard Gordon flew solo in the command module. Not a smooth ride to get there either, as the Saturn V was famously struck by lightning during ascent on November 14th. And [Electrical Environmental Consumables, and Mechanical Systems] EECOM, John Aaron in mission control suggested switching quote [Signal Conditioning Equipment] SCE to Aux. No one quite knew what that meant, but they did it, it worked, and the crew were able to navigate to the Moon with Conrad saying “whoopee” as his first word as he exited the lunar module first onto the lunar surface. Conrad and Bean conducted two spacewalks, set up some science experiments, took color video, collected rocks and pieces of the Surveyor 3 probe that landed on the surface more than two years prior. And then they returned safely to Earth on November 24th. So, in the spirit of the 50th anniversaries, I had a chance to sit down with Dr. Harrison Schmitt recently, the lunar module pilot of Apollo 17, and the only geologist to walk on the Moon. He came to our studio to speak about the 50th anniversary of the Apollo program. But I had the chance to ask him more about his Apollo 17 mission, what is scientifically interesting about the Moon, and what we have to look forward to during the Artemis program. So, here we go. Forty seven years after his launch to walk on the Moon, Dr. Harrison Schmitt. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Dr. Schmitt, I am very honored to be speaking with you today. Thank you for joining me. We're now 50 years past this historic Apollo program. Thinking back on this momentous time in American history, I wanted to start just before you came to NASA, or even shortly after, what were some of the more interesting geological questions that you wanted to answer when looking at the Moon?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, the Moon had long been an area of scientific fascination for geologists, as well as astronomers. And I think the main thing that we were, needed to know is how old was the surface of the Moon, how old were the rocks that we could see from using telescopes? And also, well, because, mainly because that would tell us how much of Earth history it was going to record, because the Moon has been in the vicinity of the Earth as a planet for billions of years, but we just didn't know how long that was. And so if there was one fundamental question that related directly back to the Earth, it was how old was the Moon?  Host: Now, tell me about when, when we were looking at the Apollo program, actually putting boots on the surface of the Moon, what you did to study the Moon, pick out the best locations in the more interesting geological parts of it.  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, the initial selection of landing sites was based purely on operational considerations. What were the smoothest areas that we could identify using the photography that the Lunar Orbiter unmanned satellite of the Moon had provided. The Lunar Orbiter program, and the Lunar Surveyor program, the Soft Landing program, had been in the mix even before Kennedy made his announcement. And they were programs that then were transferred over into the Apollo program office and then retargeted in order to examine those areas that might, around the equator that might be most favorable for landing. And so the first two landings were basically related to those early landing sites. And then as we got more confidence, we started to expand the landing sites until finally with Apollo 17, the mission I flew on, we landed in a valley deeper than the Grand Canyon. And only about seven kilometers wide. So, it was really a spectacular evolution of the landing site selection.  Host: It was really--establishing the confidence of the operation itself. Given that, this was a fairly new operation. You know, we were just getting to the Moon.  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, it was new, you know, in fact, people had to realize, Apollo 11 was a test flight. Nobody knew for sure that we were going to be able to land on Apollo 11. And, of course, we came close to not landing on Apollo 11. But, nevertheless, through the skill that Neil Armstrong showed, we were able to do that. And also, the knowledge that was present in Mission Control Center, we can't forget how important a role they played in the Apollo program. And you also have to keep that in mind of when you decide you're finally going to go to Mars, mission control won't be nearly as involved. There will be a planning operation, but not a real time part of the actual landings on Mars.  Host: Very true. Now, you said Apollo 11 was selected mainly because of operational constraints, making sure that we can successfully land on the Moon. That was one of the big parts of why we selected that site.  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, it was a little more complicated than that.  Host: OK.  Harrison Schmitt:  Because Apollo 8, Frank Borman, Bill Anders and Jim Lovell's mission, was targeted to the farthest east landing site that we had determined would be acceptable for Apollo. And when they were able to view that landing site using a ten power monocular, they felt very confident, Bill Anders in particularly, that it looks pretty good. And so when Apollo 10 came along, I suggested to Tom Stafford that maybe we ought to ask management to shift their landing site, one Apollo landing site, westward. So, they would have a chance to look at a second site, as well as a third site, because they were going to be in orbit longer. And we spent quite a bit of time with management trying to convince them that that was a good plan, and eventually prevailed. And so the planned landing or launch day for Apollo 10 was shifted by one day in order to see two more sites. Well, as soon as you did that, that pretty well determined where Apollo 11 was going to land. They were going to land at the targeted site for Apollo 10.  Host: Now, this site, of course, being, you know, operationally the chosen landing site for Apollo 11, what geologically was interesting about it?  Harrison Schmitt:  The main thing that was geologically interesting about Apollo 11 was gathering a broad suite of samples. And that's, indeed, what Neil did. Neil did a fantastic job. In about 20 minutes, he gave us one of the best collections of lunar rocks that we've ever gotten in a short amount of time, including the soil of the Moon. He told me later that he looked at that rock box that he was putting the rocks in, and he said it looked awfully empty, so he just filled it up with soil. Even though, you know, it's a famous number, ten zero zero eight four is the soil from the Apollo 11 site. And it's extremely important soil. Not only did we get the age, we found out the Moon was very old from the rocks that Neil brought, collected. But that soil has given us great insights into the resource base that the Moon represents, not only for lunar settlements, but also potentially for use here on Earth, namely a fuel for fusion power, light isotope of helium that is present in those soils. And then again resources that can help us go to Mars.  Host: Now, as a geologist, I'm sure you had a drive to actually put yourself on the Moon and look at all these fascinating sites from your own eyes. Tell me about your drive to go through the training for other systems; command module training, lunar module training, to become an astronaut and actually fly to the Moon as a geologist.  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, as you can gather from Deke Slayton's book “Deke,” he did not think that they needed scientist astronauts. And so the challenge in front of all of us, scientist astronauts, the six that were selected, was to become as operational pilots as they possibly could. Not only jet pilots and helicopter pilots, but also to be as good as anyone at operating the spacecraft. And so that was the challenge in front of me, that if I was ever going to have a chance to be part of a crew that went to the Moon, I would have to be as good as anybody else.  Host: Now, reflecting on specifically Apollo 11, can you tell me about where you were, where you remember being during that mission, and what were you doing?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, most of the time, Apollo 11, I was in mission control. I had spent a great deal amount of time both with the training of the crew, with the monitoring of the configuration and packing of the descent stage, and also with the planning of the little bit of EVA activity that they were going to have, and so I spent a great deal of time, as I did for all the missions except my own, in mission control. That's where the action was. And that's, and those were the people you were going to be dependent upon once you were in space. So, I have great respect and a lot of great friends in mission control.  Host: Looking back 50 years, can you tell me your thoughts when you saw Neil Armstrong take those first steps on the Moon?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, it was exciting for everybody. And primarily because of the patriotism. People have to remember that Apollo 11, the whole Apollo program started out initially as a part of the Cold War, the competition between Communism and the Soviet Union and democracy in the United States. And the people who signed up for Apollo, 450,000 Americans were in this primarily because of their patriotism and their belief that it was critical to the competition that then existed in the Cold War. And so it was mainly a patriotic feeling I think that we all had, particularly those of us in mission control, that the success really was what Kennedy had asked us to do, what Eisenhower had helped plan and develop technologies to do, so that we really did make a difference in the Cold War. I think we all felt that it may have made a big difference. And subsequently émigrés from the then Soviet Union made it very clear that once we had landed on the Moon, indeed, once we had launched the Saturn V, that they felt the Moon race was over.  Host: We're now 50 years past that moment. Can you tell me what you're thinking now 50 years later?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, I feel the same way. I think not only was it extraordinarily important to the winning of the Cold War, to the collapse of the then Soviet Union, but now it offers lessons to us as we enter into a period of time where we may, and I think do have another Cold War, primarily in competition with China. And the Apollo program is an example for NASA or some other agency that may come into existence on how to compete in space, in deep space, how to manage the risks of deep space, and how to create a management environment where things can happen very, very quickly, and you can make milestones.  Host: Going back to post Apollo 11 landing, I'm sure after witnessing Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Moon, you had some ideas from a geological standpoint of what was important and how to conduct science and look for the right samples. Can you tell me about some of your work moving forward from Apollo 11 to your mission, Apollo 17, where you were training other astronauts in preparing yourself for those missions?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, all of that preparation actually began before I even applied for the astronaut program. It goes back to having been able to work with Eugene Shoemaker in the U.S. geological surveys activities that related to Apollo. They were on NASA contracts to think exactly about those issues, of not only how would you do science on the Moon, but what science would be important? In fact, I even planned a lunar traverse, hypothetical traverse, using the Ranger pictures from the Ranger program, the last image of the Moon that Ranger provided before it crashed into the Moon. I did a traverse plan was published, and was I think the first traverse plan that was ever done. And after Apollo 11, and once we knew that in broad strokes what we were dealing with in terms of the age of the Moon, the variety of lunar rocks that we might see, what may have been the evolutionary sequence of the Moon as a small planet, that then started to get everybody thinking, not only myself, but many others, about how to gather more information, more detailed information about the Moon and how it, how it relates to the Earth. Again, the Earth was our primary focus, that early history of the Earth that is obscure to us down here on Earth because of the dynamic processes that take place geologically here versus the very quiet activity of the Moon, at least in the last three and a half billion years.  Host: Now, jumping forward to Apollo 17, in what way, in what ways were you essentially practicing and studying for your mission?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, Apollo 17 training actually began when I worked with Dick Gordon as a backup crew member for the Apollo 15 mission to the Moon. And that was really the beginning of my intense training. 15 months of training, then 15 months of training for Apollo 17. And most of that training, of course, had to do with flying the spacecraft, and carrying out the actual operational plan for the Apollo 17 mission. In addition, because of the training program that I had put together for the Apollo 13 crew, and that continued on for the other missions, we spent about a week a month actually out in the field working on geological problems, but getting used to using the equipment that we would have on the surface.  Host: Now, again, just prior to Apollo 17, you putting your own boots on the Moon, tell me about some of the top lessons and strategies you learned from some of your other fellow Apollo astronauts who previously walked on the Moon. What were they telling you on how to be successful?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, the main thing that we learned from all the crews is that time is relentless, that you never have enough time to do what you want to do. And no matter how conservative you make the flight plan, you run out of time. It's just the way space is. And it's, in fact, it's the way life is. But it is focused and concentrated in space more than normally is the case here on Earth. And so we tried to put together flight plans, our EVA plans, particularly, that understood that you would never have enough time to do things. And for Apollo 17, because we had a geologist, a field geologist, that's very important distinction, is someone who's used to sizing up a geological situation quickly using their experience to do that, and then focusing on what appears to be important at that particular location. And so for Apollo 17, we tried to open up the timeline so I would have enough time to do that while the commander was actually doing the housekeeping part of taking care of the Lunar Rover and other things like that. And then once that was complete, then the two of us could focus as a team, and very important to work as a team, for sampling and photography and the like, on what seemed to be the best approach to gathering the most information we could from any particular station that we would stop at on Apollo 17.  Host: Now, referring back to your training, you said most of your training was, of course, for the operations of the whole thing. Focusing specifically on the lunar module, can you tell me about that experience, training in the lunar module and learning to pilot it for your mission?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, the lunar module was a remarkable vehicle. It, of course, was designed to work in space, not in an atmosphere, it was very lightweight compared to what you would expect a spacecraft to be. Certainly anything that Buck Rogers had would not work very well on the Moon because of the mass. And so the lunar module was an extraordinary challenge. And the workers at Grumman Aircraft Corporation at the time did a remarkable job in developing it, as well as the NASA engineers who oversaw their work, and who figured out in the final analysis how to get the weight to a point, the mass of the lunar module to a point of where it could actually land on the Moon, given the kind of energy that the Saturn V had to place it there. So, it was a remarkable vehicle. It could do many things. Obviously, we used the computer. It was a very primitive computer, but one that did the job extremely well. And one thing you have to remember, that that computer was tied through telemetry to larger computers, much larger computers, IBM computers here on Earth. And so when we made a measurement using say a telescope or something like that in the lunar module, or in the Command Module, that information came back and was processed down here on Earth. And then the results of that processing was put into our guidance system in the two spacecraft. So, it was a cooperative thing between the space, between space and mission control, very important cooperative activity. One of the things, though, that for our mission that I think was unique, I know it was unique, is that we were able to figure out, I worked with the engineers who had developed the abort guidance system, which was a different kind of computer, much less precise than the primary guidance and navigation [control] system that we had, the PGNCS, but I worked with a way in which we could get an altitude update during landing, during the final approach to the surface of the Moon, get an altitude update in the abort guidance system, so that if we had to, we could probably have landed using the aboard guidance system if the primary system had failed. We didn't have to use that, but that was different about the Challenger operation than any other mission is that, with the help of these engineers, I had figured out how to get an altitude update into my computer. The aboard guidance system was a computer that I ran.  Host: Well, tell me about some of the, some of the challenges, being a geologist by training, to learn these systems, compared to some of the test pilot astronauts.  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, it turns out that test pilots and geologists are very much alike. They, they have to be good observers. They have to have a background in a wide variety of scientific disciplines. Clearly, the test pilots did not know the geological vocabulary. And so we kept that as very simple, very simple as possible. But, and clearly geologists didn't know how to, how to fly an airplane. Most of us didn't. And so that was, the main thing was to bring these two groups together using their complementary talents, and actually end up with pilots who were good field geologists, and a field geologist who was a good pilot. And that really is I think a lesson for the future is that that's the best way to operate. In fact, I would have every geologist that goes to Mars also be a jet pilot and a helicopter pilot I think is very, very important discipline, type of discipline to have learned, even though you learned it late in life.  Host: Now, jumping to you landing on the Moon for Apollo 17, tell me about your thoughts, suiting up and taking those first steps.  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, you get so focused on following the timeline, making sure that you maximize the use of the taxpayers' time that you have on the Moon, that you don't, I didn't think very much about what was going on other than to make sure that we were getting out and getting to work. And in retrospect, you file away these impressions. But I didn't stand around and say ooh and ah very much on the lunar surface. But we landed in a valley deeper than the Grand Canyon, as I said before. And it's really a magnificent place. The mountains on either side went to 1,600 on one on the north to 2,200 meters above the valley floor. It was brilliantly illuminated by the sun. But the unusual, two unusual things was that anytime you looked up into this blacker than black sky, you could see the Earth. And a really remarkable experience.  Host: Now, tell me about your, your mission priorities as a geologist. Now you said you were focused in trying to stick to the timeline. But you wanted to free up your time so that you could survey and use your eye to look at the more interesting parts. Tell me about your priorities.  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, we had, with the help of many people, had put together what turns out to be an excellent plan using the limited photography we had of the landing site. Today, of course, we have Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter images of the landing site, which are, if we had had them at the time, you stand back and say, “would I have changed the flight plan?” Well, actually, it turns out, I don't think I would have, based even on the information we have today. But we have learned so much from the samples and the photography that we've just been able to enhance and grow from the information that we collected. But, and the priorities that we had established for the Apollo 17 mission was to take advantage of that three dimensional situation we were in to sample boulders that had rolled off these high mountains, to look at an avalanche deposit that had come off of one of them. And the whole area seemed to be covered by some dark material that we had thought would be volcanic ash. Turns out it was, but we did not expect in one of the great discoveries of Apollo 17 was to actually find a deposit, a relatively undisturbed deposit of this volcanic ash, the so called orange soil. It is actually orange and black. Most of it was black, but the top part of it was orange. And that discovery has turned out to be one of the primary discoveries related to the Moon and the Earth in that it tells us more about the origin of the Moon. It tells us about the presence of volatiles and indigenous water inside the Moon. And it tells us about the processes by which these, what we call pyroclastic volatile driven eruptions occur on the Moon. Anybody who watched the news about Hawaii knows what a pyroclastic eruption looks like. A very violent kind of thing. On the Moon, that has happened in 1/6th gravity. And so they're even more spectacular, or were more spectacular three and a half billion years ago.  Host: Yeah. You know, looking back at that time, looking at all these different samples, is there a particular moment you remember retrieving a sample or something you, maybe something unexpected that you remember doing in one of your EVAs?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, almost every sample was unexpected because we couldn't see that resolution. And so you pick a place where you think you're going to find something interesting, and indeed, every place we picked did have things that were interesting. And I mentioned the orange soil, the volcanic ash that we discovered. That probably was the highlight of at least that particular EVA, the second EVA. But every mission, and I continue to work on these samples, and the work, and not so much on the samples, but what other people have done to analyze the samples and try to synthesize that information into a more, into a coherent picture of what actually happened on the Moon, and how it relates to the origin of the Moon, and indeed, to the history of the Earth.  Host: So, tell me about the, some of the other experiments that were happening during Apollo 17. There was a, there was a light flash experiment looking at cosmic rays, gravimeters, some of these other experiments.  Harrison Schmitt:  We had a wide variety of geophysical experiments that we put out on the Moon. We deployed an active seismic experiment, which were actually charges of the largest one was about six pounds of TNT equipment we deployed these. And they were activated, of course, after we left, and not before. I had, I deployed almost all of them, and I had to pull three-- pins to activate timers that would allow them to be exploded 90 hours after they were activated. And so there was plenty of margin there. But still, you have six pounds of TNT in your hand, and you're pulling pins on it, that's an interesting psychological thing to be doing. We also had a traverse gravimeter experiment. So, we measured the lunar gravity at every site where we stopped. And then some. That information has been refined recently using the laser altimetry from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft, so that it is even better now than it was when we gathered it. Same, same data, but it's been refined using that new information. We also had a lunar surface gravimeter, just a steady gravimeter that was designed to measure what's called the free oscillations of the Moon. The Earth and the Moon both have free oscillations if they're activated by an earthquake or a moonquake. But also they would be activated by gravity waves coming by. So, it was the first real attempt to measure gravity waves, to see if gravity waves really existed. We now know that they do. That's been a very important experiment that that's been conducted here on Earth. But at the time, the idea was to use the Earth and the Moon as a big oscillator in space. And so if a gravity wave went by, it would activate both of them at the same time. That, unfortunately, that experiment did not work. But, nevertheless, the idea was there, an extremely important idea to try to verify Einstein's hypotheses about gravity.  Host: Right. Now, a lot of these experiment, you're saying, understanding more about the Moon helps us to understand Earth, which is extremely important. There's some physics aspects to what you're studying. Can any of this be applied to future exploration knowing what it would be like to, if we were to live on the Moon for extended period of times, any of this data relevant to maybe those missions in the future?  Harrison Schmitt:  The main data that we have now about the Moon that's relevant to future settlements, future activities on the Moon, is that that comes from the soils, the lunar soils, because those soils have been gathering the resources of the Moon that are put out as part of the solar wind. There's hydrogen, there's nitrogen carbon principally. And with hydrogen, you can always make water and extract oxygen then from the rocks themselves. So, for the future, our primary knowledge that we have gathered has been from the soils of the Moon. And as I indicated earlier, there is a light isotope of helium called Helium 3 that is the only resource that we know about on the Moon that potentially can be of great value here on Earth. It is an ideal fuel for fusion power, produces no radioactive residuals of any kind, but produces electrical power at very high efficiency when fused with itself, or with the heavy isotope of hydrogen called deuterium. So, we have two great discoveries based on really what Neil Armstrong sampled as ten zero zero eight four, that soil that he filled up the rock box with, and that we know that we have resources that can support us when we decide to live on the Moon, and when we decide to go to Mars, and a single resource that may be of extraordinary value here on Earth, particularly as we try to wean ourselves from fossil fuels.  Host: Jumping back to your Apollo 17 mission, you spent three days on the surface. Can you tell me about actually living beyond the work itself? Did you establish a routine, or what was it like to actually live there for a few days?  Harrison Schmitt:  There's almost never any routine when you're on the Moon. Something always happens that disrupts the plan. For one thing, right, as soon as we, almost as soon as we landed, when we were having our first meal, well, the compartment where the meals were stored opened up, and the pressure from the atmosphere, the pressure in the bags had put enough pressure on the door of that compartment that when we opened it up, all the meals came out into the cabin. So, we had to figure out a way to stuff all that back into the cabin. Also, you never can really experience 1/6th G continuously without being there. In fact, that's the essential ingredient of the excitement of being on the Moon is being there. You can't transfer that to you or to anybody else. You have to go there yourself. So, I hope you have that opportunity someday. But we of course knew how to swing our hammocks for sleep in the lunar. But until you actually do that and get in them, you don't realize how comfortable 1/6th gravity can be. I slept extremely well on the Moon. I'd wake up about every two hours and listen to make sure that the fans and the pumps were all still running. You don't want complete silence on the Moon, believe me. And then I'd go back to sleep. So, I slept very well. I can't speak for the commander, I can't, or anyone else, but I slept very well on the Moon.  Host: It's almost like the routine was adaptability really just going with the--    Harrison Schmitt:  That's the essence of being a human being, is being able to adapt.  Host: Tell me about, particularly on your mission, you traveled pretty far in the Lunar Rover, the LRV. Can you tell me some of the advantages you had driving that distance, and really expanding your reach on the Moon?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, there was a great debate before the Lunar Rover was finally picked as a system for use on the Moon. Between having a driving machine and having a hopping machine. And that was an interesting debate. Chemists tend to favor hopping from place to place, because they just want a sample here and a sample there, sample there. A field geologist wants to see the context as you approach a particular sample site. You want to see how does everything else fit into that particular place. So, that debate went on among geologists and engineers as well. And Max Faget, who was the chief engineer down here at the manned spacecraft center, now Johnson Space Center, it, he finally just asked one question. He says, “how are you going to train to use a hopper?” And that pretty well settled that. It was going to be very difficult. We had been going through the lunar landing training vehicle experience for three, including Neil Armstrong, had to bail out of that machine, it was a very difficult thing to train with. The lunar module pilots finally were not trained in that because just the difficulties of using it. And so Max had a great deal of influence on whether we had a Lunar Rover or Lunar Hopper. Now, the Lunar Rover itself worked very well. We could go at about 10 or 12 kilometers an hour over most of the terrain that we drove on. It could, we drove up a 20 degree slope to get to Station 6, the big boulder there. So, it performed extremely well. It never, we never had any problem. There were little glitches on the other two missions, but we had never had any noticeable problem. The Boeing people, the Marshall people, the General Motors people all did a wonderful job in building, designing and building that particular vehicle. It really made a great deal of difference. The main contribution I think I made to operations of the Lunar Rover while for Apollo 17, was to develop a Rover sampler, which was basically a nested set of what we call Dixie cups. In a sampler, we could put on one of the extension handles. And I wouldn't have to get off in order just to get a soil sample, or a small rock sample, just by reaching down. And those samples have turned out to be extremely valuable because they give a lot more context between stations of how were these soils of the area changing as we approached different sites.  Host: So, and you were able to do that because of the distance you can cover with the Rover.  Harrison Schmitt:  Yeah, no question about it. We covered a total of about 32 kilometers with the Rover. The farthest we went away from the lunar module Challenger was about seven kilometers out to Station 2 at the base of the South Massif. It was the highest mountain in the area.  Host: Now, one of the things you mentioned about looking out onto the surface of the Moon, you mentioned the blackness of the sky, but you also mentioned that you can see the Earth. Can you tell me about seeing the Earth from the Moon, and some of your thoughts there?  Harrison Schmitt:  I can't really tell you. You've got to go there. [Laughter] It's always in the same part of the sky because the Moon, as the Moon goes around the Earth, it keeps the same face towards the Earth. And so the Earth is always in the same part of the sky. If you're right in the center of the Moon, it's going to be directly above you. It was a little bit, it was down below that point a little bit for us. It was always over this high mountain, the South Massif. And so seeing that was really a remarkable experience in that black sky. And it's primarily blue with white clouds, patterns that we're familiar with. And the one thing that stands out on the Earth are the large desert areas, such as Australia, for example. Stands out almost as an orange beacon, even from the distance of the Moon, 250,000 miles from where we were.  Host: Reflecting on Apollo 17, can you tell me about your crewmates, Gene Cernan and Ron Evans?  Harrison Schmitt:  Outstanding crewmates. I think I can say that for all the crews. For the most part, they worked together extremely well. Once assigned to a mission, they approached it very professionally. Not many of them were close friends, I don't think, afterwards. I think the Apollo 12 crew was probably a good example of very close friends. But most of the people, just they were professional that came together as a crew, worked extremely well, and did extraordinarily great jobs on each of the missions. Now, Ron Evans I think probably knew the command module America better than anybody had ever known the command module. I was really very impressed with what Ron could do. He, and, of course, he had to spend three days alone in orbit around the Moon, but in that process, operated a wide variety of remote sensing instruments, as well as kept prepared in order to receive us should we have to leave the Moon in a hurry.  Host: Jumping to after Apollo 17, returning, you know, you were conducting all of these experiments, and you've already mentioned some of the findings from some of those experiments, some of the things you've discovered from doing geological surveys on the Moon. But can you tell me some of the things, some of the other highlights of the things you learned during your stay?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, just recently, we've been able to take the nitrogen isotopes that are in the deep core of the, that we obtained on Apollo 17, take the data from those nitrogen isotopes and look like we have found a major change in solar activity just about 500 million years ago. We're still working on that. But it looks like something strange happened to the sun. It increased its luminosity, the amount of energy that was coming from the sun. About 500 million years ago. And one of the interesting things is on Earth, that's when there was this explosion of life. We call it the Cambrian explosion about 550 million years ago. And most people said that was because the Earth was warmer. Well, maybe it was warmer because the sun changed its way of operating. That's the kind of thing we're working on right now today. And it's made possible, in large part, because of the advance of analytical technology. What we do today compared to what we could do 50 years ago with these samples is almost night and day. It's really amazing. It's like the discovery of water in the ash, the orange ash that I sampled. That was done first in 2008. We never, we thought up until that time that the Moon was bone dry, that there was no water. We knew there were other volatiles, but no water. Well, now we know there's water inside the Moon. And that, in turn, standards to open up your thinking about what about the ice that we think we've discovered at the poles of the Moon? Is that old water that came out as volcanic eruptions, or is it new water that's been formed by some other process? We're having a lot of exciting times in the lunar science community right now.  Host: And that, that brings up a good point, is even after your mission, you've still stayed very connected to studying the Moon and trying to uncover its secrets. Can you tell me a little bit about that, your continuing involvement with science on the Moon?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, I've tried, since I left the United States Senate, I've tried to get back in the game, so to speak, and I give a paper two or three a year at various science conferences. And I try to publish also just recently two years ago, my colleagues and I published a paper called “Revisiting Apollo,” Taurus-Littrow, the Apollo 17 landing site. And we didn't get all the way through that revisit, but that's still in work. There are other papers now that they're drafting and trying. But the main thing I've tried to do is synthesize everything that other people have done. And that is a very exciting thing to do. I don't-- I’m also involved in one of the sample analysis teams that's going to look at these samples that have never been opened that NASA has recently decided they would open. Core 2 from our Station 3, Apollo 17 Station 3 on, on the-- that large avalanche that I mentioned. That I'm working with the University of New Mexico scientist Chip Shearer who will be the lead of our team. It will be a multidisciplinary investigation of these unopened samples. So, that's an exciting thing to do as well.  Host: It's quite amazing about how many, you know, all these samples we collected from Apollo that we still continue to investigate and find out new things along the way. Why do you think that is? Is it a little bit because of technology, or why do you think we are continuing to learn?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, it's several things. It's, technology certainly is giving us new tools. But people have learned a lot. They're thinking differently. They come up with new ideas and the like. I think it's a combination of that. And it's been extremely active community for 50 years. And there's no indication that it's not going to be active for another 50 years at least. Again, people have said that the samples are the gift that keeps on giving. And there's no question that that's the case.  Host: Now, you were there when President Trump signed Space Policy Directive 1. Can you tell me about that experience?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, it was great to see the president take personal responsibility for getting us back into deep space. The vice president certainly has played a tremendous role in that effort. The reactivation of the National Space Council is very important. They also now have a user advisory group on which I serve, as well as a number of other people from around the country. And so it's a very active policy time right now. The big question is can NASA reorganize itself so it can actually carry out that directive? And we don't know the answer to that yet. NASA is not the NASA of Apollo. It's older. It's more bureaucratic. And it has its own heritage that it has to either, let's say it has to deal with. And so we're still waiting to see whether now NASA can implement a very aggressive program that was recently put forward by the vice president on behalf of the president that we get boots on the Moon again by 2024. And that's extremely important we do that. As I indicated earlier, we're in another Cold War that I think the administration does recognize that, and it's important that we be not only a competitor in that effort, but also that we succeed and are successful in that effort.  Host: And that is a bold claim. Boots on the Moon by 2024. Part of that plan is to move forward to a sustainable presence. Right now, I think the goal is 2028 to have a sustainable presence on the Moon. Can you tell me about what a sustainable presence on the Moon would mean from a geological perspective? What are the benefits of doing that?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, if you establish yourself in a sustained base or settlement, I like to think of a settlement, not only to harvest the energy resources of the Moon, the Helium 3, but to, as byproducts, have the resources necessary to go onto Mars. Then geologically, you're going to learn about another planet eventually. Namely, Mars. But also it provides a base of operations for the exploration of the Moon. You don't have to always launch from Earth to explore a new part of the Moon. You can launch from that base to go to anywhere on the Moon really and conduct those geological studies. The main thing that studying the Moon gives us about the Earth, one of the things we already have, and that is we know now that the early history of the Earth was extremely violent. There were major, huge impacts happening not only on the Moon, but on the Earth. And at the same time, though, life was getting a start. The complex molecules were getting organized, and ultimately became replicating molecules that led us to life. And the more we can understand the Moon in that period of time, the better we're going to understand the origins of life here on Earth.  Host: Well, looking forward to going back to the Moon, or sorry, forward to the Moon. What are some of the more interesting places? Do you have some locations in mind of what would be probably more interesting to explore or to, like you said, settle?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, the largest basin on the Moon, the largest impact produced basin on the Moon, is almost certainly about 3,200 kilometers in diameter. It's called the Procellarum basin. That's continental in scale here on Earth. That would cover the entire United States. The one basin that everybody agrees occurred is 2,500 kilometers in diameter, also continental in scale, and it may be in these very large basins we have the origin of the continents. We don't know that yet, but that's a possibility, that a variety of things happen in order to see the continents after these large basins formed. The main issue I think, though, is to start to sample the materials of these basins. And the one large basin that I mentioned, 3,200 kilometers in diameter, Procellarum, is so old that it's going to be very difficult to know that that's what you're sampling. In fact, I think we've already gotten samples from Procellarum, but that's a different story. That, the geologic context of Procellarum is going to be very difficult. Whereas South Pole-Aitken, the other basin, 2,500 kilometers in diameter, is still well defined. And if we do our planning right, I think we can not only learn about the materials produced by such large impacts, but we may actually be able to get samples of the lunar mantle from the center of that crater. That crater floor is 12 kilometers below the mean lunar radius. So, it's a very deep basin, as well as a very large basin. And that probably right now is the site, the South Pole-Aitken is where I and most other people I think would like to go. And that's where the Chinese have landed, by the way. They're not, they're not very far behind us in that respect.  Host: It's an interesting place, for sure. So, a sustainable presence. Can you tell me about what that opens up to the scientific community? I think you've already mentioned sample returns, more sample returns, possibly better technology. What does this open up?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, having a base on the Moon, again, gives you access to the entire Moon, scientifically. It also, though, allows you to look at things in situ that is in place. For example, we cannot produce a simulate of lunar soil here on Earth that is a true simulate. We can produce certain aspects of it and learn from those aspects. But you cannot produce a two simulate because those, the lunar soils are forming in a vacuum. That is as hard as deep space vacuum. Ten to the minus 12 torr if you're into the nomenclature of vacuums. It is really impossible not to be able to understand the processes that are operating in the lunar environment without being there and actually working in situ, in place, with those materials. So, that's probably one of the major things. And also we're just now starting to understand how the history of the sun can be deciphered from the lunar soils. And that's going to be difficult. But I think we're now finally, we've talked about it for well over 50 years, that the Moon is recording the history of the sun. And now, though, we're finally, with the data we have, with the analytical techniques that we have, beginning to understand what we ought to be looking for. But getting more pages out of that history book from different parts of the Moon is going to be extremely important if we really want to understand the long term history of the sun.  Host: Now, aside from the physical science, the geological science of the sustainable presence on the Moon, what else is important for establishing that presence?  Harrison Schmitt:  I think the main thing that's important is for it to have an economic reason to exist. And that's where this Helium 3 fusion power comes in. If, indeed, Helium 3 fusion can be developed here on Earth as a commercially viable source of electrical power, then a settlement on the Moon has an economic reason to exist. And I feel actually confident that that's going to happen someday. But, still, that needs to be established, and needs to be explored. And people are now looking at that very, very seriously. The technology is advancing to, that is related to Helium 3 fusion. That's a very important thing, because I don't think you'll do much with it until you know for sure that there's a commercially viable fusion reactor. Helium 3 is very rare here on Earth. It's only produced by the decay of tritium that, and that is tritium that's used in nuclear weapons. It has a half-life of 13 years, approximately. And so every 13 years or so, you have to clean up these weapons. And that's the source of Helium 3. Helium 3 is also very important in use in neutron detectors. The Homeland Security Department uses it. And, in fact, it's tied up most of the supply in order to be able to have detectors in our borders that can look for nuclear materials, clandestine nuclear materials coming into the country. So, there are a lot of challenges in developing Helium 3 fusion. But I think those can all be met in the long term. And that will probably be a sustaining economic reason to have a settlement, and maybe ultimately an independent settlement. Jefferson always used to say a little revolution is important every once in a while. And taxation of a lunar settlement without representation might just trigger that small revolution. And we would have a little settlement at another birth of freedom, if you will, on the Moon.  Host: Now, you've been a NASA astronaut. You've been close to the scientific community, especially studying the Moon, for years now. Can you tell me about, from your perspective, the benefits of human space exploration? Why is it important?  Harrison Schmitt:  It's important geopolitically for the United States to be very active in deep space. It's important from a humanistic point of view to continue to challenge, for the human species to continue challenge itself against the frontiers, as it always has. I think it's in our DNA to move into new areas, find new resources, new ways of sustaining our civilization. Those were probably the two most important things. One, geopolitical. And two, the continuation of the exercise of the human spirit against new frontiers.  Host: Now, I want to end on a little bit more of a fun note. Do you have any tips and tricks as a lunar explorer yourself for the future lunar astronauts?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, the main thing that you need to realize is working in 1/6th gravity is a lot of fun. I only weighed 1/6th of my total weight, including the spacesuit and a backpack and everything and I weighed 62 pounds. And so the suit is encumbering. We need much better suits. And I hope that NASA begins to invest in those suits very vigorously. But, nevertheless, the A7LB that we had for Apollo 17 worked extremely well. And remember that in 1/6th gravity, the whole surface is like a giant trampoline. It's like walking on such a trampoline.  Host: Dr. Schmitt, I very much appreciate your time today. It was an honor to talk to you. Thank you very much.  Harrison Schmitt:  It's my pleasure. Thank you.  [ Music ]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 142, “Preparing for Mars,” I'm Gary Jordan; I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. We have nearly 20 years of continuous human presence on the International Space Station. That's nearly 20 years of studying the human body, understanding systems, and fine-tuning operations, for how to conduct human spaceflight missions, not to mention the decades of human spaceflight missions and experience before that. A lot has changed over time, based on what we've learned, and a lot of questions have come up that are important to understanding how things will change when traveling to Mars. You might think, that's a lot of experience already, so why don't we just go to Mars. It's hard to imagine just how hard Mars is. It requires near absolute perfection, and any deviation may be a risk to the safety of the humans onboard or the success of the mission. So, the question is, are we ready? You can even ask, how ready are we? Luckily, we have an organization right here at the NASA Johnson Space Center, and all across the agency, looking at what we have and what we need to make a Mars mission successful. Michelle Rucker is a Mars Integration Lead at Johnson Space Center for the Mars Integration Group, a team that spans across all of NASA. She's a 33-year veteran of NASA, joining in the aftermath of the Space Shuttle Challenger accident, and supporting the investigation by conducting booster material tests and analysis. She has participated in a range of exciting projects, such as the International Space Station Environmental Control and Life Support Systems, hypervelocity impact research, spacesuit and space walking tools, space station exercise equipment, system engineering, and Orion Crew exploration vehicle testing and verification. She currently leads the Mars Integration Group, developing crude Mars mission concepts. She holds two U.S. patents and has authored numerous technical publications. So, on today's podcast, Michelle goes over the details of what we know, what we have, what we need, and how NASA's Artemis Program, that will establish sustainable human presence on the Moon, will help inform and fine-tune the ideal mission structure for a Mars mission. And I hope you like this topic, because there's going to be a lot more. This month kicks off monthly episodes that are all about a Mars mission, and we'll call it “Mars Monthly.” Over the next few months or maybe even the next year, we'll dive deep into the various elements we discuss today with Michelle. So, here we go, preparing for a human mission to Mars with Michelle Rucker. Enjoy.  [Music]  Host: Michelle Rucker, thanks so much for coming on the podcast today.  Michelle Rucker: Thanks for having me.  Host: So, this is an interesting topic. I'm really excited to talk about how we're preparing for Mars. There's a lot to consider, and it seems like it's a pretty small group doing it. I want to get a little bit of sense of your background though, to understand what has to go into the people that are actively thinking about what we need for Mars. What's your background?  Michelle Rucker: So, I was born in Alaska. So, extreme environments don't scare me. So, that's probably the first requirement for thinking about Mars. I went to school here in Houston, at Rice University. I've got a couple engineering degrees in mechanical engineering. I started my career at the White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico.  Host: Oh, right at NASA. OK.  Michelle Rucker: With NASA, yeah. If you're not familiar with White Sands, we do all the fun hazardous testing stuff out there. So, that means blowing stuff up and setting it on fire and shooting micrometeorites at it. So, I spent the first part of my career trying to destroy spacecraft. But at some point, you get tired of that, and you want to start creating. So, I transferred here to Johnson. I worked on the space station with the life support systems. I did stints with the exercise equipment. That was one of the funnest jobs I did. I also worked with the Constellation Program, for both the Altair Project and the Orion Project. And then when the Constellation Program wound down, I started doing exploration for the first time. So, I'm relatively new, compared to some of the folks who have been working about -- working on Mars for years now. I've only been doing Mars work for maybe the last eight or nine years.  Host: That's still significant, but I think what's important is, you have a -- you have that breadth of experience. You did a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The space station is really important. We're going to fold that into today's story a little bit. So, I think that's a really good background to have. Now, you say you're new, but eight or nine experiences -- eight or nine years. That's a lot of experience, to me. So, just from what you've learned, in your eight or nine years, thinking even just all the way back actually, to when we first started here at NASA, thinking about Mars Missions and what we need from Mars missions. What were we thinking about?  Michelle Rucker: So, Mars missions -- the history within NASA is sort of interesting. Only a few weeks after the Apollo 11 landing, Wernher von Braun put together a proposal for a Mars mission, essentially taking the lunar hardware that he just developed successfully for the Moon, and supersizing it and going to Mars. So, that was an initial proposal. At the time, the agency was focused on the Moon. When the Apollo Program wound down, NASA focused a little bit more on low-Earth orbit. So, the shuttle and the station era, we were a little bit closer to home. But even during that period, there was a small office -- both here at Johnson Space Center and across the agency, there were small groups working on some of the Mars technologies, thinking about some of the mission concepts. To me, Mars is a system engineering problem, as much as anything. We know how to do most of the individual pieces. It's how do you put it all together, into a single mission concept, to be successful.  Host: I see. And that's where some of the work you're doing is coming in. It's taking all those separate pieces and thinking about them and actively putting them into what we're thinking about now, with what resources and technologies we have now, but thinking just further ahead and way further out.  Michelle Rucker: Yes. So, taking the technologies we have, looking at whether we need to supplement those with new technologies. Do we need to extend the technologies a little bit more? Think about operations. Operations have changed a lot over the years, Now, we've got the commercial players involved, and that's an exciting new development. So, things have become a little bit more streamlined. Some of the things, the way we did business, even for procurements, back in the shuttle and station days, we're developing new and faster techniques for doing procurements, so that's exciting, as well.  Host: OK. So, let's go right into it, thinking about those challenges for Mars, the things that are going through your brain all the time. What are we thinking about, when it comes to what to do, what to integrate, into a Mars mission?  Michelle Rucker: So, what's interesting about human spaceflight is the entirety of human spaceflight has literally revolved around the Earth. Everything that we did with the Moon, the Moon revolves around the Earth. Everything we did with the space station, with shuttle, we all -- it was all revolving around the Earth. In order to get to Mars, we have to change our coordinate frame of reference. We have to start thinking about revolving around the sun. So, first we have to chase Mars around the sun, to catch it. And then once we get there, Earth wasn't where we left it, so we've got to chase Earth back around the sun, to get home again. So, it's a bigger scope problem than the types of missions that we've been focused on. So, the challenges, I like to break into really sort of three pieces. There's the getting there, the living there, and the coming home. So, are you ready to step through the pieces?  Host: Let's do it. [Laughter]  Michelle Rucker: So, the getting there. So, the trajectory guys like to say that it's 2,000 times farther -- it's like the odometer reading -- to get to Mars and back versus trying to get to the Moon and back. And again, that's because both Earth and Mars are moving, so it's not just a straight line there and a straight line back. You've got to chase these planets around the sun. So, 2,000 times farther than the Moon. It only took us a few days to get to the Moon. You can go to the Moon and back in a week. To get to Mars and back, that is -- that's a little bit different. How long it takes -- the transit time -- is a function of when you go, where the planets are, relative to each other, at the time that you leave, and what kind of ride you're riding in. But typically, we're talking two to three-year mission durations. So, that's a much longer mission duration than the types -- even the longest expeditions we've done on space station to date. It's only been a year. So, these are very long missions that we're looking at. So, a long duration mission means you need a lot of stuff. You need a lot of food. You need a lot of oxygen. You need a lot of spare parts, a lot of consumable parts. And that means we need to launch a lot of stuff from Earth, or we need to figure out a way to either make it or find it somewhere, either at our destination or on the way. Once we get to Mars' orbit, we will need to land a fairly large payload. To date, the largest thing we've landed on Mars is the Curiosity Rover. It's about one metric ton. The smallest human rated vehicles we've been able to squeeze -- we're looking at crews of maybe four people. A crew of four is still probably going to require about a 20-ton, 20 metric ton lander, so that's 20 times as big as anything we've landed previously. And unlike Earth, Mars doesn't have a nice, thick atmosphere, where we can use it to help slow down. So, our entry descent and landing is challenging. The other problem with Mars is global dust storms. You may have read about the Opportunity Rover unfortunately --yeah, met with a tragic end, with the dust storm in 2018, I believe. So, dust storms can obscure the landing site. So, that's another thing. We need technologies that would be able to deal with that, or we need to plan -- have good weather prediction and be able to plan around dust storms. So, once you get there and land, then there's the living there. So, in some ways, Mars is a lot like home. There's a day and night cycle on Mars. A day's a little bit longer on Mars. It's about 24 hours and 37 minutes. It's got mountains. It's got valleys. I've seen photos that the rovers have taken, and it looks just like the desert Southwest in some places. So, lots of beautiful vistas.  Host: Wow.  Michelle Rucker: It has seasons. So, a Martian year is about twice as long as an Earth year, but it does have seasons. On a balmy summer day, it can be as warm as 80 degrees. So, in some ways, Mars is attractive, because it seems hospitable. It's also exotic. It's got two moons, Phobos and Deimos. If you’re into Greek mythology, they were the twin sons of Ares, I believe. They're itty-bitty moons, but I've always thought it was kind of cool, that if you were sitting on a Martian surface, looking up at the night sky, the moons cross each other in orbit, which is kind of cool.  Host: Wow. That would be a sight.  Michelle Rucker: That would be pretty neat, yeah. But Mars is also challenging. So, it's got reduced gravity. Humans are used to 1G, and Mars is reduced -- if you weighed 100 pounds on Earth, you'd only weigh about 38 pounds on Mars. But because there is gravity, the challenge is that carrying around a big, heavy spacesuit becomes more problematic. We never worried about that too much in the ISS days, because with microgravity, a big, bulky spacesuit wasn't really a problem. But on ISS, you don't really walk. You use your hands to translate around. So, our spacesuits will need to be redesigned for a planetary surface. Once you get on the surface, humans are going to need a lot of power. Got to upload those selfies, right? You've got life support, communication, mobility, whatever science we're going to do on the surface, so we'll probably need a lot of power. The conventional wisdom is while we're in space, we just use solar, but Mars is a little bit further from the sun than Earth is, so there's reduced solar energy there. The other problem is the dust storms. The dust storms -- that's what happened with Opportunity -- the dust storm knocked out the solar energy, and poor Opportunity didn't make it. So, we need to look at some alternative sources for power. And it can get cold, in some places, in some seasons. So, it's a pretty extreme environment. So, now if we've finished up our mission on Mars, we're ready to come home, all of the Mars missions to date, all of our robotic missions, have been one-way affairs. We've never actually tried to launch anything from Mars. So, Mars does have a lower gravity, so getting something off the surface of Mars would be easier than getting something off the surface of Earth. But we still estimate about seven kilograms of propellant for every one kilogram of mass we're trying to get into orbit. Each crew member is going to be, you know, maybe 100 kilograms. So, you're talking about a lot of propellant. We've estimated up to 38 metric tons for a four crew with science equipment and their EVA suits and so on. So, that begs the question of, do we bring all that propellant from Earth, and then try to land it, or do we figure out a way to make propellent there? Those are some interesting questions. Once you get back into space, getting your deep space transport come back to Earth, you've got the Earth reentry problem. It's about 11 kilometer per second reentry back into Earth. That's what Orion -- that's the challenge Orion was designed to overcome. So, those are the challenges. And all of those taken together could be daunting, if you were trying to start from scratch, to solve all those challenges. But the cool thing about what NASA's been doing over -- ever since Wernher von Braun first proposed Mars -- is we've been whittling away at these challenges, piece-by-piece. So, we don't have to start from scratch. A lot of the projects that you may have heard about recently, Artemis, the Human Landing System, the Gateway, plus ISS shuttle experience, some of the EVA suit development work that's been going on, all of that will contribute to helping us solve some of these challenges.  Host: That's significant. That's a lot of consideration. I mean, that was -- what you just described, right there, that little packet, was the whole -- was the Mars mission. It was getting there. It was living there. It was coming back. It was in those three sections. And it's -- I'm smiling over here. You can't see it, because we're on the podcast. I'm smiling but, I mean, you make it sound like -- and that's it. And that's what we need to do. But I know it's so hard. There's a lot of challenges that are associated with this, in terms of what we're investigating. Let's kind of dive a little bit deeper into some of these challenges, starting with getting there. I pulled out a couple key elements, and as you were going there, you know, you're like, oh, that's a challenge. But I know it's like -- it's a really big challenge. So, one of them was just distance, just being far away is just -- makes everything so much more complicated, because with being far away comes -- you have communication delays. You're talking about a significant amount of energy to get there, a significant amount of time to get there, and then the positions -- like you did mention this -- the positions of Mars and Earth have to be in such a way that meet the requirements, to actually go catch up with Mars. That's all very significant things.  Michelle Rucker: It's pretty astonishing that there are smart guys who can calculate precisely where Earth and Mars will be at any given instant in time, with such phenomenal accuracy. It still amazes me. We actually rely on -- we've got a team here at Johnson, the [Mission Analysis and Integrated Assessments] MAIA team, that does a lot of trajectory analysis. We also use some folks at Langley Research Center that do trajectory analysis, and also, we've got some team members at the Glenn Research Center that help us with that. So, yeah, we spend a lot of time trying to figure out exactly who's where, when. On ISS, if you run out of something, it's pretty easy to resupply it. If you're halfway to Mars, it's a little bit harder. You can't really get supply on demand, so you have to do a lot of logistics analysis, predict exactly what you'll need when you'll need it. One of the cool projects we're working on right now with ISS, we're talking to them about using ISS to help refine some of our logistics models. They do really good tracking of what goes up and down, but because they have on demand, they don't have to necessarily predict very far in advance. We'll have to predict out up to two or three years in advance. So, one of the things we're doing is talking to them about -- let's start developing some models, to predict what you'll need on ISS, and then we'll look at actuals and see how close we came to that. So, we're using ISS today as a way to help refine some of the tools that we'll need for Mars later.  Host: Interesting. You're almost -- it's kind of like over-planning, you know. Like you're not just resupplying what you need on the space station because, as you mentioned, it's -- your time constraints aren't as drastic as Mars. So, let's just pretend that we're -- you know, we have to model what we need, what we will need, what we're going to run out of for the next two years. So, ISS is the perfect place to practice that.  Michelle Rucker: We're also using ISS as a -- we're in discussions with ISS to use returning crew members as a Mars analog. So, after six months in microgravity on ISS, physically they'll be in about the same condition as a crew that's about to land on Mars. So, we've been working with the Human Research Program to develop some experiments, where returning ISS crew members will do some simple tasks -- nothing that would be dangerous for them -- but just to try to understand what we -- what the crew could be expected to do on Mars. We obviously try to automate as much as we can, but if the crew needed to go do an emergency EVA, to go repair something, for example, the question is, how soon after landing would they be able to do it? After having spent six months on ISS, there's an enormous crew of people here on Earth that greets the returning crew and, you know, picks them up and carries them where they need to go and, you know, doesn't let them do anything strenuous for the first few days. They won't have that opportunity on Mars. They could potentially be asked to do things that they would never be asked to do here on Earth. So, we want to understand what the capabilities will be. Are there counter-measures we can use, to try to make sure that they're in good enough physical condition -- strong enough, with good enough balance -- to be able to do, not necessarily strenuous things, but things that could be dangerous, if you are far away from a doctor. You lose your balance and fall, for example. And yeah, so we try to think ahead to those sorts of things and use the available programs that we have in place today, sort of piggyback on those, where we can.  Host: Interesting. So, it's like you're trying -- you're using crew members returning to the planet, as a way to think about, if astronauts were on a very long journey to Mars, and you said -- what was it? It's nine-ish months to get there?  Michelle Rucker: It depends on when you -- which opportunity -- exactly when you leave, where the planets are, with respect to each other, and which propulsion system that you're using.  Host: That's an important distinction. But just, I mean, regardless, it sounds like it's going to be a relatively long time, about what we're doing now on the space station, give or take. So, when you land, I guess, what the human is going to be able to do, what we could do to try to -- counter-measures we can put in place, to see how we can maybe help them get ready to do something. Another thing that's coming to my mind is technology to maybe support -- maybe holding them in place for a little longer -- life support systems and the necessary provisions, so that maybe, during this recovery phase, they just need to wait it out. Maybe they have that ability. Because I know -- I mean, I've been out to Kazakhstan. I've carried an astronaut, and I know, they are just like -- I mean, but they get put right to work, right? So, they have to do these tests that you're saying right now, they have to do these tests to see -- to test performance. So, they're out there moving, but they are -- they're dizzy. They're dizzy, and they're -- they've had a long journey, and their bodies are adjusting. So, modeling that is important.  Michelle Rucker: So, that's one of the unknowns, is -- so, here on Earth, they don’t have to get up and do anything right away. There's a crew there to help them. One of the things we want to know is how soon could they safely get up and do certain tasks without risk. So, that's sort of an exciting area of research, that we're partnering with HRP on. Back on the transit question -- how long does it take to get there?  Host: Sure.  Michell Rucker: So, one of the things that we're looking at is, can we minimize either how much propellent it takes to get to Mars and back, or the transit time, or both. So, we're looking at a range of new technologies. Electric propulsion is an interesting one. So, the Gateway will be using solar electric propulsion. Those electric thrusters are of interest. We sort of see that as the evolutionary path for the Mars system, so Gateway essentially becomes our test bed for that propulsion system. Gateway also -- the other thing that Gateway does for us is outside Earth's protection. So, it will give us some deep space experience, in a harsher environment than a little bit closer to Earth, with the radiation and so on. Long duration missions, that that was one of the challenge, because of the distance to Mars and back, you're looking at long durations. ISS has already given us the long duration human exposure to spaceflight, so we have a much better understanding of that than back at the time when Wernher von Braun first proposed a Mars mission. ISS has also given us a lot of long duration equipment experience. We understand, you know, the mean time between failure and certain types of systems. We're looking at regenerative systems, trying to be more self-sufficient. So, ISS has done a lot for the Mars concepts. The new commercial partnerships that -- some of the launch capabilities that we have available now that von Braun didn't have, if we do need to launch a lot of propellant to get to Mars, we have more options now than we used to have. So, that's exciting. Being able to land large payloads on Mars, we're developing and testing several different technologies. My personal favorite is the Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator. The acronym is the HIAD. That's a pretty cool system, to be able to use the -- it's a big, giant inflatable that gives you enough surface area to help slow down your payload before you land on Mars. The other thing Gateway will do for us is -- I always say that lunar landers coming and going from Gateway to the lunar surface will look very similar operationally to Mars landers coming and going to the deep space transport. So, Gateway will offer us an opportunity -- Gateway paired with the Human Landing System will offer us a lot of relevant operational experience that will be directly applicable to what we want to do on Mars. On the living there challenges, we already have a lot of experience with microgravity, which we need for the transit leg of the mission, from our shuttle and ISS experience, but the Artemis program will give us some reduced gravity, lunar gravity, experience on the surface of the Moon that will have some applicability. For example, spacesuits. We'll need to develop a planetary suit for the Moon, something that you can walk around in. The hip joints, the boots that we use on ISS are not really appropriate for walking around in a dusty environment. So, that's something that we'll get from the Artemis Program. And then surface power, we're looking at a couple options. Just oversizing the solar rays, more surface area, is one way to go. Another way to go is a compact fission power system. Our space -- our technology mission directorate is looking at some alternative power sources to solar that are of interest to us. The Moon is cold and dusty, just like Mars will be, so that gives us -- especially during the lunar night. It gets pretty cold, so Artemis will give us a lot of experience with the extreme environments. And then on the coming home again, we're looking at -- we're looking to the Human Landing System, the lunar ascent element may be directly applicable, getting from the lunar surface back up to Gateway is not unlike getting from the Mars surface back up to Mars' orbit. So, we're looking to that program for some -- maybe some get ahead on a Mars ascent vehicle. And then of course, once we get back to Earth orbit, or cislunar space, Orion has already solved the problem of getting the humans back to the ground again, so that -- we checked that off of our to-do list. We just rely on Orion. So, a lot of the challenges have been whittled away or have been at least whittled back enough that they're within reach now, for us to use for Mars.  Host: Yeah. I pulled out a couple -- because you went through those same three key areas, getting there and living there, and then coming back, I was thinking about things that were either -- we either have or are working on right now -- regenerative life support was one that I pulled out, because I know that's an important part of living and working on the space station, which we've been doing for almost 20 years now. And developing those technologies, that's just something that we have a lot of data, a lot of experience with, and is going to be needed for Mars missions, something that we have, but the one thing I was really looking forward to is all this Artemis stuff that you're talking about. You're talking about all these technologies that are helping us to get to the Moon, yes, but in a sense, there's a lot of applications, and important applications, for a Mars mission. That was one thing I think was -- it can't be really understated, because we talked about how hard Mars is, but this Artemis as almost a practice for Mars, and preparation for Mars and data -- data gathering for Mars. That's really important.  Michelle Rucker: Right now, we're thinking of the Moon as our test bed.  Host: Yeah.  Michelle Rucker: We will -- obviously, the cheapest place to test these things is on Earth, and we will test as much as we can on Earth. I'm sure my friends at the White Sands Test Facility are excited about doing a lot of hazardous testing out there.   Host: Yes, alright.  Michelle Rucker: So, we will test as much as we can on Earth, but at some point, you've got to get some relevant space experience. There's only so much you can do in microgravity. Microgravity helps us test the transit leg, but it doesn't really do much for the planetary piece of it. The Moon gives us that. It gives us operational experience, a lot of materials reliability experience. We're pretty excited about all the testing that we can do on the Moon.  Host: Yeah. Now, you're -- the group you're in and the work that you're doing is mainly -- is it informing? Is it advising? Is it actively thinking and writing down requirements for what you think we'll need for a Mars mission? Or what we think we should be working on now to prepare for a Mars mission?  Michelle Rucker: We're not quite to the point of writing requirements.  Host: OK.  Michelle Rucker: Well, with one potential exception. So, we've got the Habitat Broad Area Announcement, [or Broad Agency Announcement] the BAA effort that's going on. That was a procurement to look at an in-space habitat, which would potentially have applicability as the deep space transport habitat. So, that is one specific procurement where very high-level requirements have been defined. We're not quite to the point of defining requirements for many of the other systems yet, but we are developing concepts, concepts of operations. Being able to jump into requirements should go pretty quick, when we're ready to pull that trigger.  Host: OK. But you're thinking about at least the elements that you'll need. And we went through a lot of them. You just mentioned a habitat. I mean, one of the main parts of a journey to Mars is the actual journey to Mars, is getting there. So, there's going to be some form of a vehicle transportation technology, whatever, to actually transit from Earth to Mars, from Mars to Earth. So, thinking about what we might need to -- what that may look like, what we'll need to consider. Because it's a long time. It's going to be a long time. So, thinking about those things ahead of time is really important. And then another part that I pulled out besides your three, thinking about the technologies we have now and are testing, thinking about the technologies that are coming up for Artemis, another part that I pulled out was -- and this is a very important part -- the human element, thinking about what a person is going to have to deal with. And you already talked about the landing, considering a landing from the International Space Station, from low-Earth orbit, having that be a model for what a Mars mission would look like. It sounds like there's a lot of human components for Artemis, as well.  Michelle Rucker: Correct. Our team, we are so lucky. Don Pettit has been assigned as our crew rep.  Host: Wow.  Michelle Rucker: And he is -- he's so awesome. If you haven't ever googled his ISS YouTube videos, he is --  Host: They're fun.  Michelle Rucker: -- he is fun to work with. So, Don's been involved with us. Yes, we have been doing a lot of thinking about the human systems. Most of the -- a lot of the Mars focus of the last few years was with the science, with the Rovers, the robotic missions, the science missions. The human missions are completely different. The science missions have taught us a lot about Mars, about the conditions on Mars, what we can expect on Mars, and that is extremely valuable, to help us design for the human systems. But the, you know, the Curiosity is just a few watts of power. It doesn't really need very much power. Humans are going to need kilowatts of power. So, it's -- once you put the humans in the system, and you start trying to run life support systems and, you know, just the level of safety requirements that -- you know, you need to be sure. You need to have a Plan B and a Plan C. I always give my friends at JPL a hard time, because they're robots. They don't need food or water or bathrooms. And the human systems -- the humans will need all of those things. So, there's a whole new level of stuff that has to be thought about for the human missions, that the robotic missions never really had to worry about. It draws power. Once you have more power, you need more thermal control. Once you have more thermal control and more power, that's more structural mass. So, these things tend to snowball a little bit. And that's why our systems end up being much bigger than the robotic systems are. People always ask, \"Well, why not just send robots then? Why not just send robots? Do we really need to send humans?\" That is a debate that will rage for the ages. What the scientists will tell you is that the humans can do in a day what it would take the robots to do a year or more to do. So, yes, there's a compelling reason to send the humans. The humans can make real-time decisions. The humans can fix things that break. When poor Opportunity got caught in a dust storm and the solar arrays were covered, there was nobody there to dust them off. So, unless you've thought through that and planned for that contingency, with the robotics, that's the kind of thing that if a wheel gets stuck somewhere, the humans can get out and deal with that, whereas the robots can't. So, I can understand both sides of the argument. I happen to work on the human spaceflight side, so I'm a little bit more predisposed to that side.  Host: [Laughter] Sure, but I think maybe you might have a better appreciation than most for maybe living on Earth and what Earth has to offer, and things that maybe people don't consider when they think, why are we not on Mars right now? Let's go to Mars. You're like, no, it's really hard, because there's a lot of things that we're doing right here on Earth that are just -- we don't even recognize -- our conveniences are just -- they're, you know, I was thinking -- one thing I was thinking about when you were talking about a journey to Mars in the distances and bringing things with you -- I just did a road trip to Florida. It took me 17 hours. And yes, I packed the car full of waters and snacks. But I stopped for coffee, for a bathroom, for, you know, just to take a break, because I could. And I could get out of my vehicle, and I can kind of get more provisions, and I can use other facilities. And then I could get back in that vehicle, and I can keep driving. But that's not -- that's not a luxury, for a journey to Mars. I'm sure you have a better appreciation than most for this.  Michelle Rucker: So, being from Alaska, I have a very good appreciation of this. So, the reason I'm from Alaska is because back in the ‘50s, the U.S. government was trying to encourage more people to move to Alaska. They were trying to open up the economy there. And one of the challenges of getting to Alaska was it was really far away, and there weren't a lot of gas stations on the way. And nobody could really carry that much gas, to get all the way to Alaska. So, they offered homestead opportunities for folks who were willing to set up gas stations. And my maternal grandmother moved to Alaska, set up a gas station near Palmer, and that's why my family was in Alaska. So, for me, it doesn't bother me at all, to think about eventually setting up way points between here and Mars, to refuel vehicles. I know some people are overwhelmed by the sheer difficulty of that. It's hard, and it's dangerous, and it is. But probably no more daunting than it was to my grandmother, moving to Alaska, with a couple of kids in tow, and setting up a gas station, out in the wilderness. So, yeah, it's hard. But there are people here on Earth who are up for that challenge.  Host: You definitely have a better appreciation. It's even in your family. Just working on this and thinking about Mars and all the challenges that have to be answered and thought about before we actually go there, but thinking about some of the things that are in the near future for Artemis, and some of the answers that we might get, some of the questions that we might continue to -- that might continue to come up and that we might have to learn, what are you most excited about for this near future, going to the Moon and thinking about some of the things that we might be able to answer for a Mars mission there?   Michelle Rucker: I spent most of my career working with shuttle and space station, and those were really fun programs to work with. We were, you know, launching humans pretty often, and we were doing lots of interesting things. Going to the Moon is a whole different set of challenges. It's some of the same challenges as -- you still have to launch people. There's still danger and risk, and things above that, but landing on the Moon, that's a whole different set of challenges than going up to the space station. Working on the Moon, that's a whole different set of challenges. To me, that's the most exciting. It's the unknown unknowns, the things we don't know about. We learned a lot with Apollo, but those were very short missions. Being able to stay a little bit longer on the Moon, which is probably what we'll need to be able to do for Mars, it will just give us a lot of information. We'll learn what doesn't work, and I think that is almost as valuable as designing things that you hope work. Knowing what doesn't work is pretty important.  Host: That's incredible. Michelle Rucker, thanks so much for coming on Houston, We Have a Podcast today.  Michelle Rucker: Thank you so much.  [ Music ]  Host: Hey thanks for listening, we have some bonus content for you at the end of the show so hang tight. First the credits. This episode was recorded on January 8th, 2020. Thanks to Alex Perryman, Pat Ryan, Norah Moran, Belinda Pulido, and Jennifer Hernandez. Thanks again to Michelle Rucker for taking the time to come on the show. I hope you liked this topic, because there’s going to be a lot more. This month kicks off monthly episodes all about a Mars mission, we’ll call it “Mars monthly.” And over the next few months, maybe even a year, we’ll dive deep into the various elements we discussed with Michelle today.   Host: Last month, NASA released a new podcast: NASA’s Curious Universe. Our universe is a wild and wonderful place, and in this podcast, you’ll join NASA astronauts, scientists and engineers on a new adventure each week. Take a listen. Padi Boyd (Host): Before an astronaut ever sets foot aboard the space station, they have to train somewhere you might not expect. [Deep plunge/cannonball splash sound] Padi Boyd (Host): This isn’t just any old swimming pool, it’s the Neutral Buoyancy Lab, located at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. This special pool contains 6.2 million gallons of water, enough to fit nine Olympic-sized pools inside. It’s where astronauts like Nick come to train. Nick Hague: So, the pool is this gigantic pool. It's 200 feet long. It's 100 feet wide, and it's 40 feet deep. It is enormous. It's still not big enough to fit the entire space station in it, but it fits full-scale large chunks of the station so that we can practice. And that's our training ground. Padi Boyd (Host): The pool is where astronauts first get acquainted with the armor that protects them from space, their spacesuit! And that can be its own challenge. First thing. You’ve got to suit up. It can take about 45 minutes and the assistance of multiple suit technicians to get the suit on — checking to make sure that every piece is fitted and working properly, from the helmet locking into place to the gloves fitting around every finger.  Nick Hague: You have to learn how to use the spacesuit, because it's not like wearing clothes. It’s, constraining, and it limits some of the things you can do. It's fatiguing because of the pressure of having it stiff, and so you have to learn how to use it, and that takes hours underwater, getting to know your spacesuit.  Padi Boyd (Host): Once you have the suit on and it’s been double, and triple checked, you can prepare to enter the Neutral Buoyancy Lab. Even though you’re not out in space just yet, the pool will simulate what you might feel once you’re out there. Why? Because being underwater simulates weightlessness. Nick Hague: The Neutral Buoyancy Lab is there to train us, because that's one of the places or one of the ways that we can try to simulate being weightless. So that idea of neutral buoyancy. Padi Boyd (Host): It’s called “neutral buoyancy” because when you’re in water and you don’t sink but also you don’t float, you’re completely neutral.  It’s like you’re “hovering” in place.  Nick Hague: And so, it feels as though I’m weightless and I can maneuver myself around the outside of the space station and have the experience of working in a weightless environment. And so, we’re constantly trying to balance out the weight of an object with its buoyancy so that things just float in front of you. Padi Boyd (Host): Weights and flotation devices are carefully combined to let astronauts feel what it’s like to be weightless in space. When an astronaut is training in the pool, their backpack — the Primary Life Support Subsystem — is filled with air they can breathe and instruments that monitor their health.  Nick Hague: You've got to get everything straight because once you go underwater, that's all you've got are the tools you took with you. You're going to be down there for six hours. Padi Boyd (Host): That’s about the amount of time it takes for a spacewalk in actual space. Once you’re in the pool, waterproof instructions are attached to your arm, and you rehearse the spacewalk as if you were doing the real thing.  [NAT SOUND of TRAINING: “Alright, Nick, before you get started on that…. If we could just… help me guide that out… much appreciated.”] Padi Boyd (Host): The whole time, a team of people is watching every movement of your practice spacewalk. They monitor the pressure inside of the suit and the temperature. And the test director is making sure that the whole process is going according to plan.  [NAT SOUND of TRAINING: “Good teamwork there. Exactly….” “So, I need to float a little bit higher on this end… alright, OK, so that’s good alignment.”] Padi Boyd (Host): Trained scuba divers guide you around a replica of the outside of the International Space Station. [NAT SOUND of TRAINING: “yeah, looks good here. Yep, we’re aligned down here.”] Nick Hague: Having this full-size mock-up of the space station underwater allows us to, to essentially memorize where every handrail is, where every handhold is, and if I'm going to work in a particular location, on orbit, I will have seen that and understand that location on the ground.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, episode 75, Radiation Shielding.  I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today.  On this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, and astronauts all to let you know the coolest information about what's going on right here at NASA.  So, if you're familiar with us, you may have heard us talk about radiation before.  We've talked about the effects on living organisms from Dr. Zarana Patel on Episode 57.  And we've had Dr. Steve Johnson tell us more about the physics and the day to day operations on the space station dealing with radiation and space weather on Episode 64.  But today we're learning once again about Orion and how the spacecraft is built to withstand the radiation environment of deep space from Matt Lemke.  He's the Orion avionics, power and software deputy manager here at the Johnson Space Center.  He understands how Orion is radiation-hardened so the systems inside can withstand the harsh environment of space.  The key word here is redundancy.  So, with no further delay, let's jump right ahead to our talk with Mr. Matt Lemke.   Enjoy.    [ Music ]    Host: Matt, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today to talk about radiation shielding on Orion, the deep space spacecraft that we have here.    Matt Lemke: Yeah, it's a pleasure to be here.    Host: All right.  So, we've talked about radiation in general before on the podcast.  We've talked about how it affects the human body, we've talked about the physics of it, space weather, why we have to be concerned about it in the first place, but not specifically how it affects spacecraft.  And this is an interesting one because Orion is going to go deeper into space and it's going to pass through the Van Allen radiation belt and there's a lot of concerns when it comes to traveling in deep space, specifically when it comes to radiation.  So, why don't we just kind of start off there.  Radiation.  What is it?  Why do we have to be concerned about it?    Matt Lemke: OK.  So, the radiation comes from the sun.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: And so you've probably heard that in your space physics lecture and they probably did a better job than I will, but you've got a couple different sources of it.  Different types of radiation.  So, you have this Van Allen belt you mentioned and we have a magnetic field around the Earth.  And that traps a lot of protons and, you know, that size of particle, and that's what we've been used to dealing with for so many years.  Space station, space shuttle, we got really good about how to work in the proton environment that's there, so there's real good ways to test for it, see what our equipment's going to do, make sure we can recover.  But now as we go out beyond and through the Van Allen belt and into deep space, we have to start worrying about solar flares and galactic cosmic rays and these things that have a lot more energy and can come into the electronics and corrupt them.  And so that's what we're really worried about versus the effects to the human is, what's the effect to the computer?    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: And so a radiation, a proton, a galactic cosmic ray, something like that can come in and it'll change a 1 to a 0 in your electronics.  So, your computer thought, hey, I was working along, I'm doing my instructions one at a time, executing my software, and suddenly the data is wrong or the software program has been corrupted by changing a 0 to a 1 or vice versa.  And so we have to build systems that can handle that.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: You know it's going to happen, radiation's out there.  It's statistical whether or not you get hit, and so we designed systems that can tolerate those bit flips.    Host: Yeah.  So, I mean just besides the human element, now we're talking about-- radiation, when it comes to being concerned about what radiation is going to do to a spacecraft, corrupting how it works, that's really the concern.    Matt Lemke: Right. That's the concern.    Host: And that's a big concern.    Matt Lemke: Right.  And so, on Orion, if you think about it, the computers control almost everything.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: The life support system, the communications, the propulsion system, navigation, so everything is controlled by the computer and so when the computer malfunctions you have a problem.  And actually sometimes it's good when it really malfunctions bad, because then you know you have it, right?  You have your Windows machine and you get the blue screen of death.  Well, at least you know something happened and you can reboot it and do something.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: So, that's one type of error we can have.  The other type of error is it just corrupts the data.  So, you thought you were getting, you know, readout coms and it says it's 15 whatever units and that's a wrong number now because a bit got flipped.  So, it can mislead you and it can just corrupt it and make it stop working.    Host: Huh.  So, when it comes to understanding these problems and knowing kind of-- trying to understand what you have to do to fix it, my first thought comes for detecting it.  How do you know that you have a wrong number?  How do you know that the data that you're getting is in fact wrong and has been affected by radiation?    Matt Lemke: Right.  That's step one.  And so we have a flight computer.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: And-- we actually have four flight computers and we can get into why we have four because it's due to radiation, but even within one flight computer, it's really two microprocessors running together.  And so each microprocessor is executing the same code and then it compares its outputs and they should be identical.  So, one nice thing about radiation is it's not like vibration that affects the whole spacecraft at once.  It's a, you know, very miniscule particle or wave-- I'm not even sure what the right physics term is-- but it comes through and it only hits one thing, right, it's going to hit one piece of silicon, one transistor at a time, and mess it up.  And so the chances of the same piece of radiation going through both of these processors at the same time and corrupting the same bit so that when the two processors compare their answers that they're identical, that's just really-- we call that inconsequential.  It's not going to happen.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: So, if one of them gets an upset, the other one doesn't, it compares its answer, and then we do what we call fail silent.  We get a miscompare and we say something's wrong, fail silent, I'm not going to do anything more.  And then you depend on the other computers to take over for you.  Now, when that happens, you can reset that computer and get going again.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: And so that's a key to us is being able to reset the computer and go again.  So, when radiation affects electronics, you can have a few different effects.  One is it just sort of degrades performance a little bit.  It doesn't change a one to a zero, but over time-- so, if you're doing a long, you know, 10-year mission to Jupiter with heavy radiation, your parts may degrade and fail.  We're not really worried about on that Orion.  We're worried about those bit flips.  And when the bit flips, it can be a-- just a momentary error, it flips, and then it comes back and it's correct, or it can be permanent.  Like I burned out that transistor and it's never going to work again.  And so that's how we do our radiation testing is to make sure that the failure modes in the electronics we fly are those that can be reset by a power cycle.  If it's going to burn something up, we reject that piece of hardware and we look for a different implementation so we don't have those problems.  So, everything we're talking about is something you can fix with a power cycle, worst case.    Host: Wow.  So, to defend against radiation, you won't put a system on Orion that has the potential to burn out due to radiation.    Matt Lemke: Right.    Host: Wow.    Matt Lemke: Or at least we won't put it on Orion in a flight-critical location.  Right?    Host: OK.  You've got to be selective.    Matt Lemke: Our flight computer, our propulsion system, our life support system.  We're going to fly some laptops for crew use.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: Email, videoconferencing, that sort of thing.  Those might burn up and we'll just accept that risk, but not on our flight computer.  Not on the critical hardware that's going to fly the spacecraft.    Host: Yeah.  That's where you need those redundancies, the computers checking computers and then back up computers to check those computers.    Matt Lemke: Right.    Host: OK.  I see that.    Matt Lemke: And that's actually why we have four computers.  We looked at the environment in space.  We looked at solar flares, solar particle events, we looked at the Van Allen belt.  We looked at how much radiation there is and we predict what our upset rate is.  To buy electronics that doesn't upset, you know, that's designed for radiation, extremely expensive.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Right?  If we built our spacecraft that way, it would be using technology that was very old, it wouldn't be very capable.  So, we have to find that right balance between how often it upsets, how bad it upsets, and what we can afford.  So, our flight computers, when we predict it, worst case, there's a one in three chance during a mission that a flight computer can mess up.  So, that's a pretty high--    Host: That's significant.    Matt Lemke: That's significant.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Right.  So, if-- what happens if that happens?    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: It upsets.  It takes about 22 seconds to reboot and be going again.  OK?  So, one in three chance that a computer will fail and takes 22 seconds to recover.  So, we have a backup computer.  We put a second one on.  And then you look at what is the chances of both of those computers getting an independent radiation hit during the same 22-second window.  Right?  Because if one goes down but the other one's flying, you're good.  The problem is if both of them go down.    Host: Right.    Matt Lemke: So, we looked at that and the chances were one in 89 that both could in the worst-case radiation environment, one in 89 it could go down.  We said that's still not good enough.  So, we had three computers.  We said that wasn't quite good enough.  We had four computers and you say there's a one in a 150,000 chance that all four could go down in the same 22-second window.  We finally said, OK, that's how many flight computers we're going to fly.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: And that's, once again, worst-case.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: What we really expect is that to be more like one in a million missions that could really happen.    Host: Right.  Still, I mean-- wow, that's-- that's a big buffer. [laughter]  I'm trying-- I mean-- but the logic that you said is critical, though.  It's-- these are-- that's the-- this is the thing that's flying you, you know?  You don't want that thing to go down.  So, it comes to-- it sounds like it's a team coming together and assessing what they're comfortable with and the comfort level considering cost, considering redundancy, it came down to four.    Matt Lemke: It came down to four.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: And then that still wasn't good enough--    Host: What?  Really?    Matt Lemke: So, we have a backup flight system.  So, those first four computers are all doing the exact same software, flying the vehicle, and then you worry in addition to radiation, what if you had a common-cause software failure?  So, there was a bug in your code that you didn't catch in ground testing that could cause all four to go down at once.  We have a whole other computer that does backup flight software.  So, written separately, wouldn't have those same flaws.    Host: Huh.    Matt Lemke: So, we really have those four plus another one in the case of a radiation event to keep us safe.    Host: Wow.  OK.  Yeah, I think I would feel pretty safe flying on that thing.    Matt Lemke: And that's the key.  And what we use is-- like you say, we balance all those different parameters and radiation is just one parameter we worry about, right?  So, we manage the whole spacecraft based on a loss of crew probability.  We have a requirement that says we want one in 240 missions is our chance of actually losing the crew due to something we know about, whether it be the parachutes going out, radiation hitting the vehicle, whatever.  So, when we accumulate all that risk, we want to minimize that loss of crew probability.  And that's what we use to drive where we put our money and where we put our effort onto the vehicle.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: And, fortunately, radiation is something we can do something about, right?  We can add redundancy.    Host: Right.    Matt Lemke: We can do all of that.  And so right now radiation is not one of those top program drivers to the risk of losing a crew.    Host: Huh.    Matt Lemke: Because we could-- there's something we can do about it.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: You know, a heat shield, you have one.    Host: Right.    Matt Lemke: The parachutes, you have many, but three main ones.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: And you could lose one of those and still land safely.    Host: Right.    Matt Lemke: But you can't lose two.  So, some of those things, we want to be the ones that drive-- the things we can't do anything about, we want them to drive our risk, not things we can do something about.    Host: Yeah.  Because you have these redundancies because you honestly don't know when radiation is going to hit exactly that computer and which one and how many.    Matt Lemke: Right.    Host: Wow.  OK.  So, that's-- when it comes to radiation shielding, the way that you are shielding the spacecraft is through redundancy.  That's really--    Matt Lemke: I've never thought of it that way before.  That's not what shielding means, but that's how we handle the probability of the radiation happening is through redundancy.  Shielding is very difficult.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Right?    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Space station has, you know, a certain amount of aluminum on it.  Orion has, you know, aluminum, titanium, some back shells.  But these particles are so energetic, they're just going to go through.  So, we don't get a lot of physical shielding from anything like that.  You know, if you had a space craft that was surrounded by a foot of water, like a water bladder, that would really help reduce your radiation risk.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Kind of heavy and not very practical.    Host: Right.  Yeah.  That's a lot of water.    Matt Lemke: Right.  So, basically we do do what you said is we make sure our redundancy is there in order to accomplish a mission safely.    Host: So, that's-- when it comes to radiation, you know, we're talking a lot about software and the computers that are controlling.  What else can radiation affect on Orion?  What else can it affect-- can it-- can it blast through some of the materials themselves?  Can it-- can it burn out wires?  Can it affect the power source?  Can it do any of that?    Matt Lemke: Yeah, radiation can affect anything, but remember these are extremely small particles, so it's not like a bullet blasting through something.  It's at the atomic level.    Host: Right.    Matt Lemke: And so it really doesn't affect a piece of wire.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Right?  So--    Host: So, even if it does, this is not something that you need to worry about when you're designing a spacecraft.    Matt Lemke: Right.  We don't worry about that piece of it.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: That's where you get into some of the more long-term effects of radiation of-- a board just slowly degrades.  Right?  So, it hits this molecule and throws it out of the-- how it's supposed to operate.  Then it hits another one and eventually your transistors just start not working right.  So, they're-- that's the time duration aspect to radiation.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: Which on, you know, this particular mission we don't have to worry about.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: You know, a Mars vehicle, something that's going to be out there maybe for a couple years, we'll have to start worrying about what we call total dose effects.    Host: Right.  Yeah.  You'll have to watch those computers pretty carefully, right?    Matt Lemke: Watch those computers-- and really it's not even just computers, that's what we've emphasized so far--    Host: Sure.    Matt Lemke: But your radio.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Matt Lemke: It's really a computer these days, right?  That's all digital.  Your displays are digital.  The life support, the, you know, the controllers for the pumps and the fans.  Those are all digital.  So, all of those also have the opportunity to be affected.    Host: Huh.  OK.  I'm thinking about testing.  You know?  You're talking about-- you're thinking what could happen, you have these redundancies.  Do you have some sort of-- I'm imagining a radiation room where you put the computers in and you start blasting away and let's see what happens and let's see if the computers can still run with all this radiation happening?    Matt Lemke: Right.  So, the best way to do that is to put it in space and test it.    Host: There you go.    Matt Lemke: Because you need these very, very energetic particles.  So, we try and do the best we can on Earth.  We go to things like Texas A&M University has a cyclotron where it can shoot heavy ions at you and you can control which heavy ions it shoots and how many it shoots per unit time.  But they don't have the same energy as what you can get from the sun.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: And so, they don't have the ability to penetrate like all the way through your computer and the beams are very small.  So, it's not possible to take your whole flight computer and put it in a radiation chamber or a radiation beam and get a test all at once.  We have to go to space for that.  What we can do is test each individual component.  So, we can test the processor chip and the memory chip.  We take the lids off, we expose the inner silicon to the radiation beam, and then we-- we're running test software that looks for errors.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: Right?  And so that's how we know if a part burns up.  Right?  We put it in the radiation beam and it stops working forever and a power cycle doesn't fix it.  We know this is not a part we want to fly.    Host: Yep.  Don't use that one.    Matt Lemke: We put it in a beam and it does nothing but upset constantly, also not good.    Host: Right.    Matt Lemke: So, we find the right mix between what parts are available, how often they upset.  And then our radiation physics people take the cross-section of the beam, the cross-section of the part, how often it upsets, and they give us an on-orbit prediction for what's going to happen.    Host: OK.  So, I guess really what you're looking forward to now is EM-1, the first flight of the Orion out towards the moon, around the moon, right?  That's where it's really going to hit some of that-- those high energy radiation that you're talking about.    Matt Lemke: Right.  When we flew EFT-1, the flight test--    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: We actually went up 3000 miles, so we went out through the Van Allen radiation belts and back in.  So, that was a good first test.    Host: How'd it do?    Matt Lemke: Of how we did in radiation-- and we did very well.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: That was a very short mission, you know, three and a half, four hours long.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: But it did get up through the belts.  We didn't have upsets, we didn't see that, but that's more of a statistical thing, right?  It could have happened, could have happened multiple times, and we would have said our models are still good.  So, now we start talking about a mission to the moon.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: You know, 14 to 40 days, that sort of duration, and your chances go up.    Host: Right.    Matt Lemke: Of having these events happen.    Host: OK.  So, that's-- yeah, that will reveal a lot on how these-- this avionic software is.    Matt Lemke: Right.    Host: Can we-- when I'm thinking about a spacecraft, you know, we're talking about it going to the moon, right?  I'm imagining-- especially when it comes to software and processing capability, we've come a long way in that field when it comes to the last time we took a human-rated vehicle to the moon and that was the Apollo capsule, right?    Matt Lemke: Right.    Host: What are some of the differences there?    Matt Lemke: It's really about computer control of the vehicle.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: So, when Apollo went, things like the life support system were not computer controlled.  Those were all-- we call them analog controls.  They were just, you know, thermostats and different kinds of electronics to control each individual subsystem.  The difficulty with that is when you find a problem, you want it to operate differently.  There's no easy way to fix it.  Right?  You have to redesign the hardware, rebuilt it, retest it.  So, there's a big advantage to making the spacecraft lighter, more capable, easier to change, and easier to maintain, so let the computers run everything.  And now when you find a flaw, all you have to do is change a few lines of code-- and I say all you have to do-- you've got to test it, you've got to make sure it works.    Host: Sure.    Matt Lemke: But you can do it without affecting the hardware and you can do it on a much more efficient schedule.    Host: OK.  Yeah.  So, we've definitely come a long way in that--    Matt Lemke: We've come a long way and it then gives you flexibility for how you want to operate your spacecraft too.  Right?  So, now you can do things you never were able to do before.  You can go anywhere.  You know, Orion's going to be able to go anywhere around the moon and land back anywhere on Earth, versus Apollo had a very tight corridor of where it could go.  So, we have a lot more capability, a lot more changes we can make.    Host: Yeah.  Wow.  One of the things I'm thinking of is-- thinking about the Apollo missions is how short they were.  You know?  You're only talking about a couple days.  But now with Orion, after the first couple test missions, EM-1, EM-2, we're talking about a gateway around the moon.  We're talking about long duration stay and sustainability around the moon.  That requires length of time and that was one of the things you touched on.  So, how do these tests for radiation and redundancies test out over time?  Is that something that we still need to discover?    Matt Lemke: We include that in all our calculations.  Right?  So, the longer you go, if I tell you there's a one in 10 chance of getting an upset today--    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: And tomorrow and the next day, as you add up the days, your probability goes up that something will happen.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: And so the duration-- since we're not worried about total ionizing dose effects, we're not going to be there that long, it's just a matter of it's more and more likely you're going to see events the longer you're there.    Host: Of course.    Matt Lemke: Right?  And the other risk you take is solar flares.  Right?  They're infrequent.  When they go, they may not come and get you, they may go some different direction.  We have some prediction capability on solar flares and some warning.  So, you know, you wouldn't launch a spacecraft knowing a solar flare was on the way.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: But you start extending the length of the mission and you start increasing your chance of getting a solar flare while you're there.    Host: Huh.    Matt Lemke: And so, you know, that's part of our driving case.  That's what makes our worst-case radiation prediction is we're depending on a twice the worst-case solar flare we've ever recorded.  So, back in 1989 there was one, they recorded its magnitude, it's the biggest we've seen.  We say, well, what happens if it's twice as big?  That's what we're designing for.    Host: Wow.    Matt Lemke: Now, we don't want one of those to hit.    Host: No.    Matt Lemke: And from your-- when you were talking about the effects on humans, you don't want that to hit.    Host: Definitely not.    Matt Lemke: Right?  So, there is a place inside Orion, I don't know if you talked about it before, but it's the most-shielded place.  Even though the aluminum doesn't do a lot, the crew can get into the most shielded place.  And while they're stuck in there, you'd like your computers to keep working.    Host: Oh, of course.  Of course.    Matt Lemke: Right?    Host: Yeah, because even if they do survive, you don't want-- you still want to be able to fly home.    Matt Lemke: That's exactly right.    Host: Very, very important.  Now, we're talking about these redundancies, we're talking about being out in the moon for longer periods of time and being able to deal with that over time.  I'm thinking about just besides the technical component, the computer component, just sustaining the vehicle-- the power.  Is that something we have to be concerned about with radiation?  Or, actually, why don't we just back up even further, how does that even work?    Matt Lemke: So, we have batteries.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: Right?  Keep our spacecraft going all the way from prelaunch, you know, from the time when we lose ground power all the way until we get on orbit and we can unfurl solar arrays.  So, there's four solar arrays on the surface module of the Orion.  So, I don't know if you're familiar with the Orion capsule, but it's got a crew module, which is a place where the crew stays the entire mission.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: Then we have a service module below it that contains our power, our extra oxygen, water, fuel, propulsion systems.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: That keep the vehicle going throughout the mission.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: And then we jettison that service module right before reentry.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: And then just the crew module comes home.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: And that service module we call the European service module because it's being built by ESA and their prime contractor Airbus over in Europe.  So, it's an international program.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Part of that service module is four solar array wings.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: So, these are four rectangular wings that unfold once we get on orbit, about 19 meters in diameter, so they unfurl, they're pretty big; 15,000 solar cells, individual solar cells on there, and they generate all the power for the spacecraft.    Host: Nice.    Matt Lemke: And so as long as we're in a place where the solar arrays are out and we have access to the sun-- like we're not behind the moon-- we're generating power and keeping our batteries topped off.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: Now, when we go behind the moon or we're in a shadow, then our batteries take over.  And then, of course, when the batteries-- when we jettison the service module to come home, now we're on battery power as well.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: So, those batteries have to be big enough to get us back down through the atmosphere and land in the water and then keep the crew safe for up to 24 hours after they're in the water.    Host: OK.  Does this-- I'm trying to-- I remember seeing an animation about the EM-1 and I think there was-- there was one more stage of the SLS, I think, itself that got-- that did the translunar injection.  And then once it was on the way to the moon, that's when the solar arrays came out.  Is that right?  Is that how--    Matt Lemke: We actually put them out ahead of time.    Host: Oh, you do?    Matt Lemke: So, we want to check out our spacecraft and make sure it's good and healthy before we do that burn to go to the moon.    Host: Oh, that makes sense.    Matt Lemke: Right?  And then of course if for some reason the solar arrays can't come out, if the mechanism doesn't work, they don't unfurl right, if there's some problem, we need to still have enough battery power to do an abort even though we're in space and get back down while we still have battery power.    Host: OK.  So, while you're still within the vicinity of the Earth, you're checking out a lot of these systems because once that translunar injection burn goes, you want to make sure everything's working.    Matt Lemke: You want to make sure it's working.  And then you have to be careful.  Now you've put these big wings out and you're going to fire a big rocket from SLS, we call it the ICPS, interim cryogenic propulsion stage-- I think I got that right.    Host: All right.    Matt Lemke: But that's a lot of thrust and a lot of force on the spacecraft.  So, we have to put the solar arrays in a safe altitude so that the forces of the rocket engine firing don't break them.    Host: OK.  Is there redundant systems there for power to make sure that we have enough to go in case something were to happen?    Matt Lemke: Yeah.  So, the whole vehicle has to be at least one failure tolerant.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: Right?  So, we have four batteries on our vehicle.    Host: Four.  All right.    Matt Lemke: Right, but what if one of them failed?  So, we have to make sure that if any component-- any one component on the vehicle were to fail, whether it be a flight computer, whether it be a battery, a solar array, that we can still complete the mission safely and get the crew back home.    Host: OK.  And that-- and I'm guessing the four solar arrays that are kind of pointing out, these four rectangular solar arrays, there's redundancies there too.  For whatever reason, this one's not getting enough power, but you still have the other ones.    Matt Lemke: If this one doesn't come out, a wire breaks, the articulation mechanism that lets it point to the sun, if that's not working right for whatever reason, if one of them fails, we can still finish the mission.    Host: So, how are we working closely with the European Space Agency to oversee that everything's going to work, we have enough redundancies that the crew module is going to be able to talk to European service module and stuff like that?    Matt Lemke: It's really-- you know, at the working level, it's just like working with another NASA center or working with another contractor.    Host: Cool.    Matt Lemke: Right?  So, we work with our Airbus counterparts, we work requirements, we work designs, we have design reviews, we do testing, that sort of thing.  It's a little different contractual arrangement because they're our partners.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Right?  We're not paying them to do this, it's a barter agreement between the countries and so the Europeans are building the service module and they bring it over here and we integrate it together and make a whole spacecraft out of it.  But really half that spacecraft is being built by the Europeans.    Host: Yeah.  So, the power-- I-- there was one podcast we did a while back, I'm trying to remember the episode number, I think 28.  We talked with Jessica Vos about living in the Orion spacecraft for what could be sustained up to three weeks.  The mission profiles would be slightly less than that, but everything's going to work for three weeks.  So, is that what the power systems, the avionic systems, are those all meant for three weeks or are they designed to be even longer, thinking about, you know, gateway and missions beyond?    Matt Lemke: Right, they were originally designed for 240 days.    Host: All right!    Matt Lemke: Because back when we started the program, we had the whole concept of-- you know, we didn't have necessarily a destination, so there's a concept of going to the moon with a lander and then letting the crew module stay in orbit around the moon while the whole crew went down to the surface.  And so it may stay therefore up to 240-day missions.  So, we really designed it with that in mind originally.  The mission's changed a number of times since then.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: But really, especially like for power, as long as you've got the sun, solar arrays will be charging the batteries, you'll be good there.  We'll start getting limited on things like water and fuel as you start going longer.    Host: Yeah.  I want to go back to the avionic systems, the software for a little bit.  We talked about how radiation affects it and how we have these redundancies to think about radiation, but what is actually going on in those systems?  What is the avionic systems doing for the vehicle?    Matt Lemke: The avionic systems, they run on a schedule.  So, 40 times a second our software executes.    Host: Huh.    Matt Lemke: And it controls all the subsystems.  It's doing communications, it's getting commands from the ground and sending data to the ground.  It is controlling the pumps on the cooling system to keep ammonia flowing and keep the electronics cool.  It's running the fans that keep the air circulating.  It is-- when we need to fire a thruster to keep our attitude, it's making those corrections.  When it needs to move the solar arrays to point to the sun, it's doing that.  It's keeping track of where you are, how fast you're going, you know, what rates are you generating on the vehicle, so where are you at today.  It's navigating.  It's doing guidance for when do I need to do a burn to get there.  So, it really handles every subsystem on the vehicle at a periodic rate, just making sure they're all doing what they're supposed to be doing.    Host: Yeah.  It's the backbone for all of these different things that make the whole vehicle work.  Make it all fly.    Matt Lemke: Exactly.  We are very-- if you look at Apollo or even shuttle, you saw lots and lots of switches in the cockpit.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Lots of manual control.  We have very, very few switches in Orion.  I forget the exact number, but it's really only there in an emergency situation or when your computers aren't quite doing what you want them to do.  So, like you have switches to be able to turn off the computers.  You have switches to be able to deploy the parachutes in the event the computers don't work.  But, in general, the switches are just there to control power and do some things in case the computer is not doing what it's supposed to be doing.  Everything else is computer controlled.    Host: Wow.  All right.  So, when the crew is quote on quote flying Orion, really most of the flying is being done by all the computers because they're executing at-- like you said before, on this timeline, on this schedule.    Matt Lemke: Right.  The computers can fly the entire mission autonomously.  Right?  So, we're flying EM-1 and that will be without crews to check out all these systems and it'll fly that entire mission autonomously with people in FOD watching it from mission control, seeing if any new commands need to be sent, any corrections to be made.    Host: Right.    Matt Lemke: When the crew is there, they're sitting in front of a console that has a few switches I mentioned and there's also three display units.  And on those three display units, they can have up to six displays displayed at once where they can get insight into what's happening on the vehicle.    Host: Huh.    Matt Lemke: So, I think of it as they're following along with the flight, they're following along with the software.  They have a cursor control device, think of it as a mouse.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: It's actually by their left hand-- where they can interact with those displays even during ascent.  And so if they do need to take control, if they need to make an adjustment, they can do that.  They also have hand controllers where if they need to fly something or take over, they can do that as well.  But, in general, everything they need to be able to do is done automated and they can just interact with that automated software.    Host: Wow.  Yeah, so there-- when the crew is flying the Orion, when it comes to the-- the avionics software is doing most of it and their job is to just make sure that the avionics is doing its job.  That it's talking to all the right subsystems, that the vehicle is flying normally, and they are trained-- I'm guessing-- they are trained specifically for watching to make sure if something does go wrong, they know what to do.    Matt Lemke: They know what to do exactly.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: So, they know their contingency procedures.  We even have a lot of the normal procedures they'll have to execute are all electronic now.  So, they'll actually just come up on the display and it'll tell them do this step and it'll actually bring up the screen where they can do that step.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Right?  And then the crew just says, OK, yeah, it did what it was supposed to do, I like the values everywhere else, enter, go ahead and do it.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: So, it tries to step them through-- so rather than flying volumes and volumes of paper manual that are heavy and take up area inside the crew capsule, we do that electronically.    Host: All right.  So, that's-- I guess that component will be tested on EM-2 when we finally put crew on to make sure that-- well, we'll test the vehicle first and make sure that it's doing its thing without the crew, but then the crew will be able to understand this whole process and make decisions if something were to go wrong.    Matt Lemke: Right.  Now, we're not flying any displays or hand controllers on EM-1.    Host: Right.    Matt Lemke: So, that's being done in the labs, but they're already coming up with all those displays.  And actually a kind of interesting thing that's happening on Orion is the crew is actually developing the displays.    Host: Cool.    Matt Lemke: So, rather than the Orion program, the users, the people that need to interact with it-- there's a rapid prototyping lab in building four south and actually the crew is leading that development effort for what they want the displays to look like, how they want to interact with them, and making sure it's going to work right.  And then once a crew gets each display correct, then they turn that over to Lockheed Martin to go turn into flight software.  But they get it all right first and tested first.    Host: Yeah.  Yeah.  But then, yeah, they actually put the right stuff, the procedures, the processes that the crew understands and recommends into to the flight--    Matt Lemke: Right.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: And then they even go so far as to run crew evaluations where they'll have a mock cockpit and they'll run crew members-- various crew members-- through all the different procedures, all the different displays, get their comments, get their feedback, and that way before we spend a lot of money building flight software, we already know we have a product that's going to be good.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Versus a bunch of engineers and people thinking what the crew might like, implementing it in flight software, and then when the crew sees it and says, well, I'd like something different, we would turn around and say, well, that's too expensive to change.  So, we're kind of turning that process around to make it more affordable by having the crew give their input first.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: And get it right before we develop it.    Host: There you go.  And then-- well, first-- like I said before, we have to test it un-crewed first on EM-1 before they actually interact with it, but, thinking along those lines, you know, we're in the process of actually building the hardware for that mission.    Matt Lemke: Yes.    Host: Where are we in the avionics and power world?  How far are we along?  How many steps do we have until we have all the components ready and integrated into that vehicle?    Matt Lemke: So, we've just finished getting all the components in and tested for EM-1.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: Right?  So, the vehicle from an avionics perspective, just a couple little units left to install in the vehicle.  And our intention is to power on the spacecraft for EM-2 in September of 2020.    Host: All right.    Matt Lemke: So, that's when we have all our components built, delivered to the cape, installed in the vehicle, and ready to turn it on-- we call it initial power on-- and make the vehicle start acting like a spacecraft.  And so we're actually already started building some components.  Some of the ones that take the longest amount of time to build and test we've already started on.    Host: Cool.    Matt Lemke: And then we just have a whole schedule over the next couple years to turn them on as they need to be turned on so they're ready.    Host: There you go.  Is that being done here at the Johnson Space Center?    Matt Lemke: The Orion program office is here, but our main contractor, Lockheed Martin, is in Denver.    Host: I see.    Matt Lemke: And then really it's being built across the country.    Host: Uh-huh.    Matt Lemke: I think it's every state, including Puerto Rico, has some Orion business and avionics is spread really in many locations.    Host: Oh, really?    Matt Lemke: Honeywell, UTAS, Ball, GD, SEAKR-- and I'm sure I'm missing many others vendors-- Harris-- across the country are building the components, testing them, and then delivering it to integration labs in Denver to test them out as a system and then to KSC to test them out on the vehicle.    Host: All right.  Yeah, so this is a massive effort.  Definitely a lot of work to be done over these next few years.    Matt Lemke: Just a massive effort.  Takes the whole country to build it-- and then when you add in the Europeans--    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: I think there's quite a few countries in Europe as well participating when they're building that service module.    Host: Awesome.  Are you going to see the whole thing through?  Are-- is that your ambition to--    Matt Lemke: That is definitely my ambition.  I definitely want to see people fly again.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Right?  So, at least want to continue this sort of job through EM-2.    Host: Right.    Matt Lemke: And then we have lots of new challenges after EM-2, even.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Because after that then we want to get into-- we call it a production mode-- where we can start building spacecraft a little bit quicker, once we've tested them out, and that'll start freeing up resources to build that gateway you were talking about earlier.    Host: Right.  There you go.  A lot of work to be done, but it sounds like there's so much-- so much to this.  Matt, thank you so much for coming on the podcast and describing this wonderful world of what I thought was radiation shielding.  I imagined sort of like, you know, one of those movie shields, but really it's the redundancies and there's a lot of logic to it on how everything works.  So, I appreciate you coming on and describing that for us today.    Matt Lemke: It's my pleasure.  It's fun to come and do things like this and get away from the normal drudgery of, you know, daily business management and talk about what we're really trying to accomplish.    Host: Wonderful.  Really appreciate your time, thank you.    Matt Lemke: Thank you.    [ Music ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So, today we talked with Matt Lemke about radiation shielding and how really redundant systems make the whole thing work.  If you want to learn more about radiation, you can check out Episodes 57 and 64.  You can check out one of our many episodes about Orion.  We have a nice overview on Episode 17.  We talk about how the crew will operate on missions up to three weeks for Episode 28, and then we take a ride inside the capsule for Episode 35.  Episodes 66 and 69 are ones we did recently on Orion's heat shield and navigation systems.  You can go to nasa.gov/orion to learn more about the vehicle itself.  We've been going through some of these topics based on an article called The Top Five Technologies Needed for a Spacecraft to Survive Deep Space.  Really interesting stuff.  Gives a nice overview of some of the stuff that we are talking about in depth here on Houston We Have a Podcast.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 177, “Welcome to Mars.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. We continue our “Mars Monthly” series on first Fridays. Last month, we chatted with Doug Trent and Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo to discuss landing on the Red Planet. Just before that, we had a trio of scientists to discuss living on Mars from the human perspective. We were able to chat in depth about the challenges of landing and living on Mars, because Mars, itself, is, well, a challenging place to land and to live. So, this episode is all about Mars. What is it about Mars that makes a human mission so challenging? So, on this episode, we're exploring the geology, the weather, the atmospheric pressure, the environment that humans can be expected to live in for a human mission to Mars. Joining us to discuss the planetary science of Mars is Dr. Paul Niles, planetary geologist and analytical geochemist based at NASA Johnson Space Center. You want to know all about Mars? This is your guy. So, let's get right into it, what you need to know about the Red Planet on your next visit with Dr. Paul Niles. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Dr. Paul Niles, thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.  Paul Niles: Great to be here.  Host: Hey, so this is all about the Red Planet itself. We've been doing this series called “Mars Monthly,” really taking a journey on a human mission to Mars from, basically, launching off of planet Earth, everything it takes to rendezvous with planet Earth -- sorry, with Mars, and then everything about the journey along the way. We've even addressed what it's like to land on Mars and even live on Mars, but this, we're going to take a step back from the human side of things, definitely considering it, as we're going through some of these different aspects, but today we're going to focus on the geology, the weather. So, if you were going to visit Mars, this was your vacation, let's just call it, for the layman, but maybe for the astronauts, their mission, you know, what are some of those things that you can expect? Paul, I wanted to start off first, before we get into, just Mars in general, by understanding how you got to this point of being -- I don't if we should call you the resident expert here at Johnson Space Center for Mars, everything Mars, but how did you get into this field of really understanding and focusing your career path on understanding a different planet?  Paul Niles: Yeah, yeah, I'm by far not the only resident expert. We've got a really vibrant group of Mars scientists here who've worked on almost all of the Mars missions since the two twin rovers landed in 2003.  Host: Wow.  Paul Niles: So, we've got a great group of people who are experts in understanding the local geology of Mars. Yeah, so, for me, I just was, you know, in college, was trying to find my way, and I knew that I liked science, but I didn't want to be a physicist or a chemist, and I liked the natural world, and I liked hiking, and geology just sort of rang out for me. The other thing that I knew that I liked was space, and when I found out that people study rocks on other planets, it was like a perfect, you know, hallelujah moment of clarity, I guess you call it.  Host: Yeah.  Paul Niles: And so, yeah, that's what pushed me towards doing this.  Host: Well, let's just say you're taking your extended hiking trip, right, for those hikers out there that want to enjoy the outdoors, and they want to take their first steps on this whole new world. Let's just say we're an astronaut, and we're taking that first step out of our landing vehicle. We've landed on the surface of Mars. We're taking our first step out onto the Martian surface. What are going to be some of those first things that we notice about the terrain, the view, the weather, you know, just the composition, the way that everything looks? What are going to be some of our first things that we notice when stepping onto the Martian surface?  Paul Niles: Yeah, so Mars is one of the most Earth-like planets, and I think the first thing that everyone would notice is just how similar it seems. You know, the Mars day is almost the same as an Earth day, only 37 minutes longer. The year is quite a lot longer, but the axial tilt of Mars is really, really similar to the Earth's. So, and that's the thing that gives us our seasons. So, at any spot on Mars, you're going to be in a summer or a winter or something like that, and so, it's going to look just a lot similar. Two of the biggest differences that you're going to notice right away is the gravity and the atmosphere. The gravity is about 1/3 of what is on Earth. And so, I mean, no one really knows what that exactly is going to be like, but I imagine it's not quite looking like when you're bouncing around on the Moon, if you've seen the videos of the astronauts on the Moon, but yeah, I think you would still have quite a string in your step. The biggest difference is definitely the atmosphere. The atmosphere on Mars is very, very thin, and so, you would need to have a spacesuit and wear, you know, protective clothing for the cold. It's very, very cold on Mars.  Host: So, let's focus on the gravity first. What do we know about the gravity of Mars, kind of relative? You talked about it's just a little bit more than the Moon. You know, how it would feel, and then kind of blending that question into maybe how it shaped the geology of Mars, if at all.  Paul Niles: Yeah, it's been really hard, I mean, as a geologist, without a whole lot of other examples, it's hard to know what -- how the gravity affects geological processes. We may, sometimes, for example, trying to understand how the wind affects things. Well, obviously, the rocks and the pebbles in the sand are going to be whiter. But then, you also have a lighter atmosphere. So, it's hard to know, OK, well, there was a lot of debate about, for example, whether or not sand would get blown around at all, or whether the sand dunes we see on Mars are just -- have been there for billions of years. It turns out that you can, in fact, the sand does get blown around in these wind events, but it's a lot harder than you think. And so, people would try and simulate this in the lab, and they would use like walnut shells and stuff like that. So, it's really hard to get your handle on, because the gravity could affect, you know, any number of things, how water flows on the surface, you know, landslides, you know, everything that you can imagine.  Host: Now let's focus on the atmosphere was the other thing that you mentioned. One of the first things you mentioned when talking about the atmosphere was it's pretty cold. Is that because of the atmosphere, or is it because of the position of Mars? Give us kind of an example of what you mean by cold on Mars.  Paul Niles: Yeah, yeah. So, the atmosphere of Mars, it's pretty cold. I mean, it's not, you know, unreasonably cold, if you imagine places on the Earth. So, one of the, you know, it can get much, much colder than places on the Earth. So, down to minus 80, almost at minus 100 degrees Celsius. But it can be quite warm on the surface, minus 20, I call that warm, minus 10. But the surface can actually get above freezing. So, it can be, you know, moderately temperate. The main problem with the atmosphere, because it isn't so thick, is it doesn't hold in the heat as well as the Earth so, you don't get that, you know, nice thermal blanket effect. And then, of course, Mars is much farther away from the sun than the Earth. So, you get less sunlight and warmth from the sun.  Host: Yeah, so, you talked about the atmosphere maybe being maybe a little bit thinner. So, when you say cold, are there large temperature swings from day to night? And then, you also mentioned something about seasons, too so, I guess there's a difference there.  Paul Niles: Yeah, actually, the seasons can be pretty hectic. One of the interesting things about Mars is that the atmosphere is made up entirely of CO2 gas. So, and it turns out we actually have almost the same, you know, amount of CO2 gas here on Earth and on Mars. On Earth, it's only 300 ppm, 400 ppm parts of the atmosphere. On Mars, it's the entire atmosphere. And then, in the winter, the polar regions get cold enough that they actually start condensing CO2 on the surface. Basically, CO2 is dry, when it becomes solid, it is dry ice. So, basically, you get CO2 snow or CO2 ice forming on the surface of the planet. And so, the whole atmosphere starts to condense out of the air. So, you actually get big differences in pressure between the summer and the winter, the parts of the planet that are in the summer and are warmer, relatively, versus the parts of the planet that are in the winter. So, we actually send the spacecraft called the Phoenix Lander to the Northern sort of polar, sort of the equivalent of the Arctic Circle on Mars, and that, we knew, was going to be a short mission, because after -- once the winter hit, it became covered with almost up to a meter of ice and snow. So, that is definitely a pretty alien aspect of Mars. In fact, one of the best places to visit, I would think, would be the polar hood, sort of walking around on these CO2 ice deposits. I think it would be pretty amazing, although pretty difficult to do, with the current technology, as far as what we need for warmth and spacesuit technology.  Host: Yeah, so when you're looking at those pictures of Mars, and you see those, what looked like ice caps, the white parts, that kind of are little -- you know, they're just on the caps of Mars, that is mostly, you know, the red planet, orange planet, that is CO2. Now when you're talking about temperatures, I mean, you talk about it being difficult based on the current technology, is it really that cold that now you're going to have some engineering challenges if you wanted to explore those polar regions?  Paul Niles: Yeah, absolutely. It's pretty cold to be able to do that. It's not crazy. I don't think -- and I'm not an engineer. So --  Host: Yeah.  Paul Niles: And certainly, this isn't one of the places that we've been talking about going to, because it's just not one of the places that's got the highest science output. But yeah, absolutely, dry ice is super cold, and if you were walking around on it, it would be pretty intense, and to be clear, it turns out that the poles on Mars actually, are mostly made up of water ice. So, in the summer, when the atmosphere, then the dry ice goes away, you still are left behind with water ice at the poles. That's the white -- small white thing that you see in those pictures. And then, you also have a lot of water ice under the surface, permafrost. So, there's a lot of water ice, which is much more Earth typical involved, as well. And in fact, you can get layering of dry ice underneath water ice on the poles, and one of the interesting things that happens is you see these geysers that erupt. So, basically, the sunlight filters through the water ice and heats up the dry ice underneath it, and that becomes CO2 gas that's pressurized underneath the surface, and then it would -- it will erupt through cracks in the surface and blow these giant -- and what they look like are these sort of black spidery-looking things on the surface where dark sand has erupted on top of the brighter surface.  Host: You're making a case for visiting these polar regions. A lot of cool stuff happening up there. The water ice is very, very interesting. You mentioned, though, that there's a lot of engineering challenges that come with seeking out some of these polar regions, and then you mentioned that there are, possibly, more scientifically interesting areas. So, if you were to focus maybe on landing at these scientifically interesting areas first, would you have, you know, water ice that you can go and check out? What are some of the other interesting science, I guess, interesting parts of science that you would have at this landing site?  Paul Niles: Yeah, so, there are a lot of interesting targets that we would want to target with human missions and different things that have been discussed, and we've also explored several of these places with rovers and spacecraft already. So, one of the kind of really interesting places that you might want to go are similar to where the Curiosity rover is today, these mountains or large mounds of layered material, which are made up of hydrated sulfate, among other things. The hydrated sulfate is interesting geologically, because it indicates past presence of water. And so, that's a really interesting target to try and understand the history of water on Mars. The other thing that people have talked about using it for is if you get a lot of the sulfate, you could -- and you know, pile it into an oven, you can heat it up and recover the water from there, and if you've got the right kind of sulfate, that can be a pretty effective way of harvesting water on Mars. Now, we think that there's actually a lot of older relics, ice deposits, that might be accessible in the mid-latitude. Sort of not quite the equator but, you know, about 45 degrees or so, a little bit less, 30 degrees, where there's ice underneath the surface that would be accessible if you drilled down into it. So, there's actually a lot of places where you can, if you can combine the presence of ice and scientific targets, it can be really good for human explorers.  Host: Yeah, so -- oh, I was just going to kind of chime in and talk about the water thing, because one of the things going through my head is, you know, you're talking about there is this presence of water. We can dig for it. I'm sure there's some scientific value to understanding more about this water, but you said there's value to it being for human missions. You know, is there enough? I'm trying to kind of quantify how much water we're talking about. Is there enough to support, say, you know, having enough drinking water and I guess you could separate hydrogen and oxygen to generate oxygen for a habitable environment. Is there enough water where the water in situ can support a human mission? You know, kind of trying to get the idea of the quantity of water you're talking about.  Paul Niles: One of the things that we really want to figure out in the next ten or 15 years is exactly how much water --  Host: Got it. OK.  Paul Niles: -- is there? We're talking about a couple of different options for trying to understand what the buried ice looks like. You know, how pure is it? And how far away from the surface. We sent several radar instruments in the past ten or 15 years that have given us a really tantalizing idea about what the ice looks like, and we definitely have strong evidence that shows that this ice is present in these midlatitude regions and can be fairly close to the surface so, within, you know, ten meters or so, which wouldn't be too difficult to try and drill into. There also have been, you know, several discoveries showing that there is pure ice exposed in cliff faces in these regions, as well. So, you can see these exposed cliffs with relatively pure ice exposed, and then, near the top, a layer of sediment, regolith, whatever you want to call it. So, it seems like, and definitely in particular areas, we can identify, yes, there is a place where you could do this, where you could drill not too far and reach pure ice, which then you could set up something called a Rodriguez well, which is, basically, a well where you drill down into pure ice, and then you just pump hot water down there, and the hot water melts the ice into like sort of a bulb and gives you a bulb of liquid water, and then, you would get that liquid water and pump some of it back up again. So, you would be continuously pumping hot water down to keep it liquid, and then be recovering some of that water for your base. We hope that base, or the habitat, that would be there, would not use too much water. It would be recycled, most of it. It's not going to do 100%. But, so the main use for water is definitely for the propellant, as you mentioned.  Host: That is very interesting. Now, you talked about it being pure. Let's kind of dive into the soil a little bit. I'm trying to get a better understanding -- this dirt or I think you said maybe regolith. I don't know if it's dirt. I think, we're all speaking the same language, the Martian dirt.  Paul Niles: Dirt --  Host: Yeah, let's just call it dirt. So, what is it? What's inside of it? What's it made of? Understanding more about the soil there.  Paul Niles: Dirt on Mars is mostly just ground up volcanic rock. So, something similar to what you would find in Hawaii if you went to Hawaii or Iceland. Basically, on Mars, you have the main source of rocks is volcanic eruptions, and those can either be lava flows or they can be ash deposits, and then, those rocks get ground up and redeposited in different ways, by the wind and by water. And so, there is some evidence for other kinds of minerals, these secondary minerals we call like sulfates or carbonates that are similar to the sedimentary rocks on Earth, but we don't see real just pure versions of that like we see on Earth. So, on Earth, we have the oceans that help deposit large sedimentary rock exposures. If anybody's driven through West Texas, you drive through these rolling hills, and it's just all carbonate deposits that are left over from a sea, an inland sea, that was in that region millions of years ago, and you know, it's just, you know, hundreds of meters of it, and it's just pure carbonate, and we hoped to find something like that on Mars, and we just haven't found it. So, it looks like Mars is pretty much made up of this dirty regolith. And now, another thing I wanted to mention, since we were talking about melting water and dirt on Mars is that some people think that there's poison, that the Martian dirt is poisonous, and that's based on the discovery that was made by the Phoenix Lander, which I mentioned before, which discovered that Mars has perchlorate in it. It's about 1% in some places, maybe less in others, but certainly higher levels than what we see on Earth, and perchlorate can be poisonous to humans if, you know, we ingest it, and it's used, actually, as rocket fuel, can be very reactive when you heat it to higher temperatures. But on Mars and in the dirt, it's really quite not going to be a problem, because it's very soluble. So, you could wash it away with water. So, any kind of dirt that you want to use for growing plants can easily be treated for perchlorate by just simply rinsing it, and then, this perchlorate can be filtered out in any drinking water using just typical water filtration, which you're going to be using anyway. And so, the perchlorate situation really isn't a problem, and even if none of that works and you still have astronauts getting a little too much perchlorate in their system, you can take an iodine tablet, and that helps relieve the effects. So, perchlorate, really, among the challenges, you know, to human astronauts on Mars, the perchlorate's really not a big one.  Host: So, let's just say you're washing away the perchlorate on the soil there. What can you use the soil for? Can you use it to grow plants? Can you use it to, I don't know, to split apart and make rocket fuel or to build habitats? I don't know. What can you use the soil for? What's inside of it?  Paul Niles: Yeah, like I said, the soil is volcanic rock. So, if you go to Hawaii or someplace like that, it's a really good example of what you're going to find on Mars. And you'll notice that in Hawaii, the soil there is excellent for growing plants. Volcanic soil is extraordinarily fertile. So, you have a, with Martian soil, you have an excellent base for growing plants, and you know, the main problem just being you don't have the bacteria and the life that we have on Earth. So, in order to really develop the soil, you have to also bring in that microbial mass to help make it be the best soil that it could be. But, you know, that's certainly something that you can grow alongside the plants in your habitat.  Host: Nice. So, there's enough that it's kind of rich, but you just need to supplement it with a couple extra microbes, and you can actually use it to sustain like farming on Mars is pretty cool.  Paul Niles: Yeah, absolutely.  Host: Now, let's see, another -- when thinking about Mars and sort of how it is as a planet. I know one of the items is radiation. You talked about the atmosphere being thin. So, what's the radiation environment like on Mars for humans that are exploring its surface?  Paul Niles: Yeah, there are a lot of dangers on Mars to human explorers. We talked about perchlorate just a second ago. The other ones are the radiation that you mentioned, and dust is another major one. And sometimes, people think about wind as a problem like the movie, “The Martian.” But yeah, none of these things are really that bad if you are talking about visiting Mars. So, if you're only going to be there for a little while. One kind of interesting way to think about Mars is similar to Mount Everest. So, if you go to Mount Everest, the atmosphere at the top of Mount Everest is about 30% as dense as it is at sea level. So, if you are at sea level on Earth, our atmosphere is something we call one bar, or 1,000 millibars. On the top of Mount Everest, we have about 350 millibars of atmospheric pressure, and then, on Mars, it's about ten to 15 millibars. So, we're still about a factor of ten or 20 less on Mars, but you kind of get the impression that it's not that much different in the end. And we talked about the temperatures. The temperatures at Mount Everest are similar, minus 20 into the minus 80 Celsius. So, that is a really similar thing. The one difference is the radiation, like you mentioned. On Earth, we have a magnetic field that protects us from a lot of the magnetic radiation, and the denser atmosphere is another thing that really, really helps out. But if you go to the space station, you're still within the magnetic field, but you get a lot more radiation than you would on the surface, and we think that the radiation, in fact, we know the radiation on Mars, is very similar to what we see at the space station. So, that is -- you know, that gives us a lot of confidence to say that, you know, astronauts visiting Mars aren't going to be impacted by radiation too much. I mean, you certainly get more radiation traveling to Mars and back from it. So, the faster that you can go to and from, the better, as far as radiation goes. And another huge difference between Mars and the space station would be galactic cosmic rays. So, the magnetic field of the Earth really protects us pretty well against galactic cosmic rays. The higher energy ones, they don't care about anything. They just go through. So, we get that, but you'd definitely be exposed to more galactic cosmic ray radiation on Mars than you would otherwise. So, that's one of the interesting things that we're going to learn about with the Artemis Program, sending people to Gateway, which is going to be an orbiting outpost around the Moon and sending people to the lunar surface. That'll give us a lot of information about what that radiation environment is. And then, once you are on the surface of the Moon or Mars, you have that whole body protecting, you know, half of you, half of the -- it's blocking the radiation coming from half the solar system. So, that provides a lot of protection, and it's really quite manageable in the end. But, if you were going to live on Mars long term, it's certainly something that you would have to deal with.  Host: We were talking about radiation. Then you said some of the things for people to watch out for when on the surface of Mars are, of course, the radiation, and then, the other thing you mentioned was dust. So, what's the dust environment like on Mars?  Paul Niles: Yeah, dust is really challenging, I think. It's very, very thin, or small. So, it could pose an interesting challenge to mechanisms, seals, spacesuits. Certainly, we have had rovers on the surface for long periods of time, and those rovers have dealt with the dust pretty admirably. So, we know that it's definitely a problem that is tractable, but it's definitely something to keep in mind. The other major issue with the dust is that you have these global dust storms that happen every ten or so years, and that can be pretty substantial, as far as blocking out the sun. So, if you are planning on using solar power for your mission, having these global dust storms that might pick off, and essentially, the whole surface of the planet becomes clouded, then that's a real challenge. So, a lot of our solar-powered missions, we have to plan for particular seasons for when we think there won't be dust storms, and we're also heavily considering using nuclear power for the human mission to save us the -- to sort of help alleviate some of that risk. Although, you know, finding the right mix of different power is definitely something that we're going to want, because we want to have a happy, you know, mixture of different options available in different times.  Host: Yeah.  Paul Niles: One of the things we've actually talked about is using perchlorate, if you can actually use perchlorate in a fuel cell to help power things. So, you could conceivably, you know, this isn’t going to power the whole habitat, but it could be something that, you know, for a rover roving across the surface, you could harvest your perchlorate and throw it in your in a fuel cell and help do some extra range boosting.  Host: So, you talked about these global dust storms. They happen, you said, every ten years. How long do they last?  Paul Niles: Yeah, I mean, it's not on a regular schedule. It happens when it wants to happen, and there's certainly dust storms every year that are smaller and more regional, but the global dust storms are more dangerous, because they are longer-lasting. So, you know, they can last up to a month or even a little more than that. So, it's definitely something that you've got to watch out for.  Host: Got it. OK, and the reason you would want to watch out for it is because of the impacts to potential power systems where you're gathering power on the surface, but in terms of the dust itself, you know, blowing around on the Martian surface, from what I understand, it's not like -- you already referenced this was that scene from “The Martian” where the dust is blowing real hard, and the astronauts are crouching through because of the thin atmosphere. Even though the dust is kind of flowing around, would it feel more like a gentle breeze, so it wouldn't really impact structures that much?  Paul Niles: Yeah, the lower gravity, one of the impacts of lower gravity is the wind speeds actually can get pretty high. The Viking Lander got all the way up to about 70 miles an hour. But like you said, the density is so low that it turns out that it doesn't really feel like much. So, it's almost like a tenth of what it -- so, 70 miles an hour would feel more like a seven-mile-an-hour breeze. So, the wind isn't really a big factor. In fact, you know, scientists spent a long time trying to figure out if the wind was even powerful enough to lift dust -- I mean, lift sand grains. So, we definitely aren't going to be challenged by the wind speeds on Mars, even though they sound scary because they can be pretty fast. Things are traveling fast. The air is traveling fast, but the power isn't quite there.  Host: Yeah, right, when you say a 70-mile-an-hour global dust storm, I mean, my first reaction is fear, but if you say it's like a seven-mile-an-hour breeze, I guess it's not all that bad. So, more about the Martian planet. Now, you talked about the day/night cycle. It's a little bit similar to Earth, maybe a little bit longer by just a matter of like 30-something minutes. Now how about like an Earth year? You mentioned that it's -- did you say that a year is significantly longer?  Paul Niles: Yeah, because Mars is farther away from the sun, it takes longer to get around. So, the year is about twice as long as the Earth year. And so, all the seasons are a little bit longer or longer than an Earth season, as a result.  Host: But the day/night cycle is kind of similar enough where astronauts could have just a near-regular sleep schedule. In fact, they get a couple extra minutes in their day, it sounds like.  Paul Niles: Yeah, actually, for some of these missions, we, the scientists were actually operating on the Martian day/night cycle to operate the rovers, because the rovers would wake up at the same time, Martian time, every morning and to receive commands, and then it would broadcast back the data at the end of the day. And so, we would use the Martian nighttime, when the rover was sleeping, to create new commands to send in the morning, and as a result, we were working on a Martian day/night schedule. Now the Martian day/night, I mean, day is 37 minutes longer. So, it turns out that it's really hectic to try and do that while you're living on the Earth because, you know, pretty soon, you're waking up at, you know, when you start waking up at 6 a.m., it's not long, you know, a couple weeks later, you're waking up at 3 p.m. You know, a couple more weeks, and you're you know, waking up at midnight. So, and that's, really, really tough to maintain with the sunlight schedule. But if you could figure out a way to stay away from the sun and create your own sunlight schedule, the 37 extra minutes a day is pretty nice. When you think about you have 40 extra minutes to sleep every night -- or 40 extra minutes every day to do something different, it's pretty nice.  Host: That would be a really interesting experiment on the surface, because for the teams working the Martian rovers, you were adjusting to the Martian day, but you still had the day/night cycle of Earth that maybe, you know, tripped you up a little bit because it was constantly changing, but maybe without the awareness of the shift in change in Earth time, and you still have the sunrise and sunset approximately the same time, you know, plus 37 minutes on the Martian surface, it would be a really interesting experiment to see how humans adjust. Will they be completely fine though? They'll just, you know, get used to the 37 extra minutes? Or will they kind of start getting a little bit fatigued as time goes on, like you're saying? You know, because their body, their internal clock is telling them that it’s 3 p.m., not 6 a.m. or something. You know, that'll be interesting.  Paul Niles: Yeah, I found it really -- because I wasn't living at home. I was living in a hotel, and I found it really nice. I'm also a night owl. So, you know, it's not hard for me to stay up an extra 40 minutes every night. So, I'm getting the same amount of sleep. You know, I was able to pretty much, I could just stay up as late as I wanted to or as I could, basically, and I would always have -- you know, it got to the point where I was basically going to bed right after my shift instead of staying up another four or five hours, right? So, like you'd normally do. You usually get off work at like five, and then, you go to bed at ten. You know, I would be getting off my shift and going to bed, but I would try and stay up as late as I could, but then I'd wake up and have, you know, a few hours before going to work. It was, you know, really, really nice, and as long as you could sort of, you know, stay inside and stay away from the sun, yeah, without letting -- because after a while, that definitely does mess --  Host: I figure, yeah, for sure. Now on this topic of day/night cycles on Mars, it gets me thinking about a Martian nighttime. You know, I think we see a lot of pictures of Mars from the surface, thanks to some of the rovers that had been there. A lot of them take place during the daytime, but I wonder what the Martian nighttime would be like. You know, are the skies clear enough, where you can see a lot of stars? Could you be able to make out the Earth from the naked eye? What are some of the things you would see in a Martian nighttime?  Paul Niles: We've been able to -- I mean, there's been some just great imagery taken from the rovers where you can wake them up in the middle of the night and take pictures, and yeah, I mean, the Earth looks like sort of if you imagine, it's sort of like Venus, I guess, that would look like looks from the Earth. So, it's brighter than Mars is in our sky, but, you know, since the Earth – we can see Mars from here. You can see the Earth from Mars. The other really interesting thing that you would see at night is the moons of Mars. So, there's two moons, and they have really weird orbits, compared to what we're used to, right? Phobos orbits every eight hours, and Deimos, it goes every 30 hours. Phobos is sort of like a mini Moon. So, you could sort of like -- you imagine what the Moon looks like to us, sort of 1/10 of that or less. And it's zooming across the sky every eight hours. So, you might see it pass, maybe you could potentially see it pass, you know, you could see it set and then rise again all in the same night. Then Deimos is every 30 hours. So, but you definitely, instead of, you know, just moving across the sky as the planet rotates, you would see it move across the stars, as well. So, it's pretty neat.  Host: So, for Phobos, you said every eight hours. Could you see it during the daytime too? Because that's enough time where you might be able to -- I feel like you could maybe catch it during the day.  Paul Niles: Yeah, I mean, you know, it's just like trying to see the Moon during the day, but, you know, it's usually, if it's lit well, then yeah --  Host: If the conditions are right, yeah, but you could possibly. That's interesting. You talked about some, let's see, when you were talking about just way at the beginning of our talk, the different landing sites, and we talked about some of the things that were scientifically interesting. If you were to land on Mars, you would want to land at some of the spots that were more scientifically interesting. We talked about water/ice a little bit, but let's investigate some of the geological science. What is interesting about Mars? What are some of those things that we can't wait to get human hands to do on the surface of Mars, the scientific missions that we would want to accomplish for the Mars geology?  Paul Niles: Yeah, every time we sit down as scientists, we try and come up with, you know, what are our science objectives for exploring Mars? Finding evidence for extant life and past life, that's almost always near the top of our list. So, when we think about humans exploring Mars, we're probably going to be centering that around looking for life, either life that's living there now or evidence for life in the past. So, one of the things that we target when we're looking for life is evidence for water. So, if we know that water was someplace on Mars in the past, hopefully, a long-lived water, that's the kind of place where we want to go and look for life. So, that focuses on several different kinds of targets, like I mentioned a couple of them already. The sort of the sulfate minerals is evidence for past liquid water. The other place, and then, the lava tubes are really interesting for potentially protecting little damp areas and places where you might get ice forming in these lava tubes that could also be a haven for life. The other place that a lot of people are interested in is going to a delta. So, there are places on Mars where past rivers have formed sort of out of the mountains and into these craters, and they create these delta deposits, just like the Mississippi River Delta, but if you imagine the Mississippi River Delta with all the water drained away, it sort of rises -- it would be a positive feature. It would be sticking out of the ground, and that's what we see on Mars. So, these craters, the water's drained away, and you see these deltas, these stacks of layered materials that are sinuous, a lot of sinuous riverbeds. And that, people are really interested in going to places like that because that's the place where you might preserve a lot of material, because what happens is in a delta, stuff gets, you know, is coming down the river, and it gets quickly buried by the next stuff that comes. So, you don't have a lot of time to have it be eaten or, you know, annihilated by radiation or something like that. Now, one of the objections to that is that, you know, the river is sampling just material at the surface. So, that material at the surface might already not be the kind of stuff that you want to look for, because that might be, you know, already that's radiation, you know, exposed material that doesn't have life, potentially. And so, the delta is definitely a place to look for stuff that's sitting at the surface. One of the other places that people really want to go look is underneath the surface. We think that there's a lot of evidence for hydrothermal activity, warm water, lasting for long periods of time underneath the surface, and you see exposures of these rocks at the surface. So, you don't actually have to drill down to get there, and those are really interesting rocks. One of the interesting minerals to target there is serpentine, which is something that we know forms in sort of warmer, wetter environments, and that's something that we might target with the extended mission for Mars 2020. So, Mars 2020, is actually going to Jezero crater, which is the next Mars rover mission. It looks a lot like Curiosity. It's got different instruments this time, but same kind of rover chassis, and it's going to, this place. It's going to investigate a delta deposit, and then, as an extended mission, it might be able to explore some of these serpentine sort of clay-rich, hydrothermal deposits, so, from the deeper subsurface. So, hopefully, we're going to get a little bit of both with that mission, and it'll help us really understand where to send humans as the most promising kind of target.  Host: Yeah, I'm sure you're looking forward to Perseverance landing here. I mean, at the time that this episode comes out, we'll just be a few short weeks away from landing there. So, will you be part of the teams there? Will you have something that you're going to be looking after for the Perseverance mission?  Paul Niles: Yeah, I mean, as a Mars scientist, I'm definitely interested in the results and will be analyzing the data when the science teams release it, but I'm not on any of the rover science teams this time.  Host: Yeah, but I'm sure you're definitely going to want to get a hold of some of that stuff now. Understanding, I guess, we're talking about human missions here, and I think there's a lot of excitement for the rover landing that's coming up here shortly, but understanding the human aspect of things, what is nice about having humans on the surface of Mars to accomplish some of these scientific objectives?  Paul Niles: When we have humans there, there's just so much more that you can do, with regards to the kind of science activities. So, one of the things that the rovers really struggle with, it takes them a long time, is just any time you interact with the surface, because you have to wait a whole day to find out what happened, so, any time you interact with the surface, you really need to just do it one step at a time. So, you know, contact the surface. Then you wait to see if you actually contacted the surface correctly, you know. Then you could drill. You would drill a little ways and stop. See, OK, wait, how far did we go? You know, you have to do this all in a, you know, each-day cycle. You have to wait for the data to come back, in order to understand what happened, you know. And then, if you're moving rocks around and, you know, you've got to figure out where the rock landed before you keep going. So, there's so much that takes such a long time when you're interacting with the surface. With regards to humans, there's so much they can do so quickly. Just, you know, one of the things that we do all the time in the field as geologists is take a rock hammer and crack open a rock to look at what's inside. And that takes, you know, less than a minute. But it's just something we can't do with a rover effectively. So, you know, something like that makes things so much easier, and then likewise, just any kind of sampling that you're doing on the surface can be extraordinarily speeded up with a human there or just having a human nearby. You can do a lot with teleoperations, if you are worried about contamination in certain areas. So, we certainly talked about in areas where we don't want any of the human contamination to enter, you could send a specially cleaned robot, and because you got humans there, the light delay would be small, and you could operate pretty effectively.  Host: Is there anything we can learn from Artemis to kind of help out with some of these operations, making sure we don't contaminate different areas? You know, just working through those surface operations, those geological expeditions on the surface of the Moon, developing the right tools. Is there something we could look forward to in Artemis that can help us out for the geological expeditions on Mars?  Paul Niles: Yeah, I hope Artemis is an opportunity that we see used to really advance what human exploration of outer space looks like, with regards to, you know, planetary science. You know, we've got a lot of examples of tools and techniques they used during Apollo, and, you know, a lot of that is shovels and rakes and hammers and stuff like that, you know, we're going to want to use again. But with the kinds of new technology that we have available to us, there's just an enormous number of really interesting things that you might do to supplement and advance planetary science exploration of Mars or the Moon, and these are things that you could try out on the Moon and, you know, and make sure that they work before taking them to Mars. And a lot of this is, you know, robotic-human interaction. So, trying to design robots to do the kinds of things that robots do well, and then, allow the humans to do the things the humans do well, so that you get, really, the most efficient exploration that you can get. Because the amount of time that you have on the surface during an EVA is very, very limited. And so, we're going to have to use the robots to do and, on many things, as we think, you know, they can do most effectively, while we save the kinds of things the humans can do most effectively for the humans. And, you know, we're still trying to iron out all of that information. I mean, we've got a lot of examples of what that looks like with regards to the robotic exploration we've already done, but there's still a lot more to learn about how robots and humans could operate effectively together. And so, you know, I'm really looking forward to Artemis as being a time when we start to test out some of these ideas and start to make big strides with regards to how we explore planetary surfaces.   Host: And that time is coming up real soon, too. So, it'll be a nice teaser for when we see those astronauts on the surface of the Moon conducting, you know, all kinds of science with brand-new tools. It'll be a nice teaser for when we finally see those boot prints on the Red Planet. Dr. Paul Niles, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast. What a great conversation. I learned so much about the Red Planet, and you got me really excited for what's to come and a lot of the things that we still need to find out about working on the Moon, or on Mars, that we can learn on the surface of the Moon. So, Paul, I really appreciate your time. Thanks so much.  Paul Niles: Yeah, thanks for having me. I enjoyed the discussion, as well.

        description: "Production Transcript for Ep42 The Space Launch System Part.2.mp3 Gary Jordan (Host):  Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 42: The Space Launch System, Part 2.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  So in this podcast, we bring in the experts -- NASA scientists, engineers, and astronauts -- all to let you know the coolest information about what's going on right here at NASA.  So today, we're talking about the most powerful rocket since the Saturn V moon rocket, NASA's Space Launch System.  We've got two guests from the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama here with us today to tell us about the rocket, the payloads it can carry, and where it will go.  Spoiler alert: It will bring people, big stuff, and little stuff all farther than we've ever gone before.  See, I did it again.  You had a second chance for Part 2, and you blew it, Gary.  If you're slightly confused, it's because this is Part 2 of our two-part episode on NASA's Space Launch System.  There's still some good stuff in here, but if you want the full story, just go back and listen to Part 1.  So continuing our conversation with us today are David Smith and Paul Bookout.  David is the Vice President for Advanced Programs and Victory Solutions in Huntsville, Alabama.   He has a long career in aerospace engineering and is a subject matter expert on rocket architecture and how payloads will fit into the rocket.  He wrote the SLS Mission Planner's Guide, which gives payload developers a general idea of the capabilities of the rocket and some technical specifications so they can determine how their payloads might fit inside.  He looks after the big payloads.  Our other guest today is Dr. Paul Bookout, EM1 Secondary Payloads Integration Manager, who manages the integration of five CubeSats in the giant rocket as well the avionics that will control the deployment of all 13 small satellite payloads on the first mission of SLS and Orion called Exploration Mission 1, EM1.  He spends his time managing the little payloads, not much bigger than a shoebox, on a skyscraper-sized rocket.  So we're going to talk about just how powerful this monster rocket is, its unique capabilities, what it'll be used for, where it is in its development, its first mission with the Orion crew vehicle, and then look ahead to the future to the Moon, to Mars, and throughout the solar system.   In this particular episode, we talk a lot about propulsion on this rocket, especially comparing solid and liquid fuel for the rockets.  So at a very high level, the key differences are cost and control.  Solid rocket fuel systems are generally simpler in design, cost effective, and they produce a large amount of thrust.  But once the fuel is ignited, you can't really turn it off.  Liquid fuel systems provide more flexibility.  You can regulate the thrust through system throttle settings, but liquid fuel systems can be more costly.  Very smart engineers have assessed the best way to use these two fuels and, for the SLS, they've come up with a combined design of solid and liquid fuel system.  Solid fuel boosters and liquid fuel, the main engines to work in tandem to get you off the ground and moving fat, and then liquid fuel carries, or the liquid fuel engines will carry you where you need to go.  So we're go for launch with Mr. David Smith and Dr. Paul Bookout for the Space Launch System program, T minus 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, and liftoff of Episode 42 of Houston We Have a Podcast.   Boom, nailed it.     [ Music ]  Okay.  Paul and David, thanks for sticking around.  This is going to be Part 2.  We're sort of continuing our conversation, and we were talking a little bit during this I guess intermission, but one of the main things that we forgot to touch on was it takes eight minutes to do the first part of this launch.  That's the solid rocket boosters and the core stage--    David Smith:   Ignition to disposal of those stages.    Host:  Yes.  Yeah, but I guess up to this point, all you need is some sort of injection burn, and you can pretty much go anywhere in the solar system.  Is that right?    David Smith:   That's right.    >> So it just depend, you just define what kind of injection burn, and you can go anywhere.    David Smith:   Well, it's the injection burn, and then the characteristic energy, which is the acceleration to get to that location.  You know, it's a curve, so--    Host:  Yeah.    David Smith:   If you go farther out, the less mass you can bring with that injection burn.  So it is, it's the timing of the injection burn and the trajectory.  But also, the farther away you go in the solar system, obviously, the less mass you can carry.  So that's all kind of combined together.    Host:  That's right.  And so for EM1, the injection burn is going to be translunar, right?    David Smith:   Correct.    Host:  But you can also do Mars injection burn, or Jupiter injection burn, or, like, anything after this eight minutes, it's just, you can just define it?    David Smith:   That's right.  Yep.    Host:  So that's really the main thing about this vehicle is after eight minutes, you're ready to go wherever you want, and the fact that it's human rated, and the fact that you can bring really large payloads, right.  I guess that, we'll start off with that.  So we're building this rocket to pretty much go anywhere, but what are the sorts of missions we're looking at for the future for SLS?    David Smith:   Yeah, the first missions that are being considered are translunar and perhaps making something that has a, kind of a complicated acronym, LOP-G, Lunar Orbiting Platform/Gateway.  What it really is is like a service plaza on a toll road.  So think of Saturn V as the rocket that went out and surveyed everything and, you know, there were no roads, and it kind of established these, you know, these paths to go to the Moon, okay.  Now, SLS is going to take that survey information and hopefully make this Lunar Orbiting Platform into a service plaza where, what do you get there?  Well, you get a safe place for the crew.  You can refuel landers that can go to the Moon.  You can have a navigational way station.  You can have a communication way station.  You have a place for internationals to come by and make sure they got everything together before they go to the Moon.  This gateway, in fact, gives you universal, total access to any spot on the lunar surface.  Apollo is just equatorial.  This station will give you access to any place on the Moon.  So it has a lot of really great attributes, but it's a different kind of thing.   Unlike the Space Station, which is purely science, this Lunar Orbiting Platform is probably going to be a lot more utilitarian and allow a lot more understanding and exploitation of the Moon and the lunar surface, which is, in fact, what we need that experience so that we can actually do the same thing for Mars.  So it's three days away versus nine months away with Mars.  So that, that's our first stage.  It seems in the 2020's, we're going to be putting that together one piece at a time.  So the first piece might be an EM2 mission that delivers a solar electric propulsion system that essentially is the way that this station keeps in its place.  So it's just a little bit of impulse in this halo orbit around the Moon.  You can stay there with very little power using a xenon solar electric propulsion system.  The second part might be a habitation module.  This isn't where the crew are going to, they're not going to live here full time.  Again, it's a way station, so it's a place they can hang out, refresh themselves, get food, change clothing, who knows on their way to the Moon.  Then, they're going to have an air lock that allows them to do servicing on perhaps landers and other kind of equipment that comes into that gateway.   And then, also, a place for logistics modules to come to resupply this service plaza so that, for the long term, it can service people going to and from the Moon.  So that's probably the first part, and that looks like that would be something that would be in the early 2020's, and that's where the current administration seems to be focusing us is on doing lunar first to be prepared for Mars later.    Host:  Okay.  It's kind of like a small truck stop.    David Smith:   It is.    David Smith:   It is--    David Smith:   Think of it as, yeah.  [laughs] Yeah.  And it should be kind of looked at that way as it's a way station to greater and better things, either the Moon or Mars.    Host:  Yeah.  That's right.  You can shower.  You can, [laughs] you can service it.  It's got a--    David Smith:   Get your eggs and steak.    Host:  Yeah.    David Smith:   You know, get your car repaired.  Refuel.  Get some gas.  Tow truck is even there to maybe save you if you have a probably on the Moon.  So really, it's a good deal.  It's kind of like a lighthouse and service plaza all put into one.    Host:  But not only will the SLS get us there.  It's actually going to get the LOP-G there, right?  It'll actually--    David Smith:   It'll assemble it.    David Smith:   It'll assemble it.    Host:  In pieces.  Now--    David Smith:   Yeah.    David Smith:   If we were to do it the best way, instead of doing it in smaller pieces -- and by the way, it's going to do this just using the trunk section underneath the Orion.  So the co-manifested payload is what these little elements of the station are going to be.  If we were, if we could, it'd be best to just make one giant chunk and put in the, into a fairing, but the way I think the program is unfolding, to use crew to start with, is to bring the station in pieces that the crew can assemble at that location.    Host:  So going back to the previous episode, Episode 41 -- if you haven't listened to it, go back -- and that was the first part of our conversation, but going back to this co-manifested payload, we're talking about primary payloads, co manifested, secondary.  What's the co manifested?    David Smith:   Yeah, the co manifested, again, is the ten-ton capability that is the trunk space underneath Orion that's going to fly on the Block 1B SLS.  So in contrast, if you took off the Orion and its trunk space and put a large fairing on top, you get a primary payload that could be 40 tons the Moon.  So it's ten tons the Moon is co manifested, or it's maybe 40 tons the Moon as a primary payload.  And the secondary payloads are payloads of opportunity.  They kind of fit in little, tiny spaces that are left over.  They aren't filled up with other kinds of stuff.    Host:  And that's where Paul comes in--    Paul Bookout:  Yes.    Host:  Right?  [laughter]    Paul Bookout: That's my world.    Host:  That's right.    David Smith:   So after Lunar Orbiting Platform-Gateway, one of the early missions that's been envisioned is taking a probe to the Europa, the moon, icy moon of Jupiter.  What's so neat about this mission is that SLS, is we have to loft this payload and get it to Jupiter in two-and-a-half years, where a current ELV -- Atlas, Delta, even a Falcon 9 Heavy -- couldn't do that in more than seven years.  So we're going to cut five years off a trip.  Now, what does that mean?  Well, one, it means that you're getting quicker returns to the science community.  You're helping people not spend their whole career on one science mission.  You have younger people come in, work on a mission, do it quicker.  And if it costs $100 million a year to maintain a cadre of ground controllers watching this thing, think of the money that you're saving over time if you can eliminate five years of that mission.  Plus, the risk of that hardware traveling through space.  So this is a real enabler for Europa.  In fact, SLS is the only vehicle that can bring it there in that kind of time.    Host:  Unbelievable.  Is it a bigger payload because it's a, it's SLS, or is it just--    David Smith:   Well--    Host:  It gets it there faster?    David Smith:   In this case, Atlas could fly the same mass of payload, which is very large, by the way, but it would take over seven years.    Host:  I see.    David Smith:   So it had to take a whole bunch of gravity assists around the Earth and Venus to get it there where SLS can send it there directly.  Now, to your point is the New Horizons mission, which was the mission to Pluto, I think it was 120-kilogram payload that was finally delivered there after like ten years.  In that case, SLS couldn't get you there any faster, but it could double the payload to over 250 kilograms of delivered payload to Pluto.  So it just depends on the trajectory and the position of the planets when you do this, on what value you have, but the fact you can do it quick is a unique attribute that only SLS can bring right now.    Host:  [laughs] Unbelievable what this rocket is capable of.  And I kind of wanted to go back and kind of visit the rocket itself, where, the history of it.  Where did we start with some, building some of these pieces, and kind of where are we now?  So if we can just sort of start at the beginning, whenever SLS was proposed, and we're going to hammer in the first nail, I guess.  It's a little bit more complicated than that, but where did this all begin?    Paul Bookout:  Yes.  Of course, the primary design was based off of the shuttle heritage.  You know, we're taking components that the shuttle used, the propulsion aspects of it -- the [inaudible] motors, the external tank, and the space shuttle main engines -- and utilizing, upgrading, making more powerful the, those components and assembling the core stage.  So that's kind of where the history of where SLS is coming from.  So we want to use that existing technology, again, upgrade it, make it better.  Also, the manufacturing facilities that go into making these components are in existence, so we want to still utilize that, save money, save schedule to move forward with the SLS rocket.    Host:  Okay, and so it's kind of, that makes sense, right, because it's, you have, okay, this is a core stage that works.  These are components of the shuttle that worked.  Let's just sort of fit it and to meet these requirements of building a giant rocket that can take payloads anywhere in the solar system.    Paul Bookout:  Exactly.    Host:  And humans too.  It's human rated, which is a huge component of this whole thing.    Paul Bookout:  Definitely.    Host:  So it's, where is it being built?  Is it one location?    Paul Bookout:  No.  Actually, overall, there's 44, over 44 states--    Host:  Oh, wow.    Paul Bookout:  That different components are going to be, are being built in.  So this is America's rocket.    Host:  Yeah.  [laughs]    Paul Bookout:  So it's not just NASA's.  It's being built all over.  You know, there's more than 1000 contractors working on this, in addition, of course, into, in addition to NASA.  The core stage, which is the prime or contractor is Boeing, they're building that in Michoud, which is outside of New Orleans.  The engine prime is Aerojet Rocketdyne.  They're being developed, or manufactured, or refurbished down at the Stennis Space Center.  And then, when they're done, they'll be shipped to Michoud for integration with the core stage.  And then, that core stage with the main engines would be sent back to Stennis for testing because Stennis is the primary testing facility for NASA--    Host:  I see.    Paul Bookout:  For rockets.  The boosters is the Orbital ATK.  They're actually manufactured just north of Salt Lake City in Utah.  And it's kind of ironic that the, it's very close to the Golden Spike, where the east and west railroads met when they were building the transcontinental railroad, was very close to that because the motor segments are used in the rail system to ship down to KSC from ATK, Orbital ATK out in Utah.    Host:  Oh, okay.  All right.    Paul Bookout:  So--    Host:  I like that.    Paul Bookout:  A little history there.  [laughs] And the upper stage, of course, where, as Boeing ULA, which is a direct purchase from them for that.  And that's being built in Decatur, Alabama.    Host:  Wow.  All over the place is absolutely correct, so--    Paul Bookout:  And again, those are just the primary elements.  All the subsystems to that are spread out all over the United States.    Host:  So what is currently built, and then what's on the ticket to be built?    David Smith:   Well, right now, the core has been built three times so far.  The weld confidence article to make sure that friction stir welding is appropriate because it's the world's tallest, biggest weld fixture--    Host:  Oh, wow.    David Smith:   Down at Michoud, so we had to test that first.  Then, they're building test articles.  And then, the flight hardware.  The test articles right now are up at Marshall, so there's this new barge -- actually, it's the same barge they used for shuttle Pegasus.  They had to make it a lot longer, so they cut out the middle and put in a new middle section.  And that just shipped up, the core section up to Marshall, where it's going under, undergoing static testing.  The engine section's already been completed.  The testing of that's been completed.  And the intertank, the sections between the hydrogen and oxygen tank, has just arrived at Marshall Space Flight Center for testing.  The hydrogen and the oxygen tanks will arrive later this year for testing at Marshall too, all for static testing, where they're put under a load to simulate their launch conditions.  So this is the largest structural testing campaign since shuttle in the 1970's, and, you know, since this is probably a 50-year rocket, this is really laying the foundation for that kind of generational spacecraft capability that we're building for the Moon and beyond.  The upper stage, the exploration upper stage, the NASA one is currently being worked on in design phase, but the ICPS that Paul talked about earlier, the interim cryogenic propulsion stage, is finished and down, already been tested and shipped down to KSC.   The engines, the new engine controllers are hot fire tested at Stennis already, and I might even hear a sound of that in a minute.  And the boosters, as we talked about, were built in Utah but had full, two full-scale static firing tests at the Orbital ATK facility so far.  Core stage and booster avionics testing are undergoing at Marshall right now in specialized, in a specialized, integrated avionics test lab.  So the testing is going forward.  It's really quite a test campaign.  Working on EM1 right at the moment, but, in parallel, getting ready for, I'm sorry, Block 1 to start with, and, in parallel, working on Block 1B for the EM2 mission maybe in 2022.    Host:  So I'm, I want to understand the full scope.  That's, there's a lot of different elements, a lot of different parts of the testing.  What are some of the main things that you really want to test?  It sounds like structure is one of those things, and how do you do that?  How do you test the structure?    David Smith:   There's a new static test facility at Marshall that's been developed where you essentially set them up vertically, and then you put a load down on the stage, and you do it in many different angles to make sure you can understand not only is it going straight in flight, but if starts experiencing some kind of skew because of the engines, so it undergoes quite a bit of testing that way.  That's obviously, the structural modes are the most important.  And when we talk about human spaceflight hardware, what that really means for structure is that you test it to a factor of 1.4.  So it means there's a 40% margin on the capability of that structure, which is not something that expendable launch vehicles have to worry about.  So our rockets are generally a little heavier, a little stiffer, a little more capable, but we do that to provide more margin for the crew in case of emergency.  So that's the biggest part of that structural test that's going on right now at Marshall.    Host:  That goes back to your point, Paul, about one of the main parts of testing this and building SLS is the fact that it is human rated and you have these extra constraints for making sure that safety is and redundancy is one of the primary concerns of building this rocket.    Paul Bookout:  Exactly, yes.    Host:  Unbelievable.  So the other part is the engines too.  You're actually firing the engines.  And it's a hot fire test.  What's that?    David Smith:   Well, that's, the shuttle engines are going, they're installed into a test [inaudible] at Stennis.  They're put through the same paces as if they were being launched in the vehicle.  And remember, some of these engines haven't been test fired in eight years, seven, eight years.    Host:  Right.    David Smith:   So it's real important to make sure that they're still, still have the quality that we are looking for at the same time they have a new engine controller.  So the controller, the computer that runs these engines have been upgraded from the shuttle days.  So it's the first time those two have been mated together.  So real important testing.  We have I think up to 15 of those engines in inventory, so they're going to be going through those until they, at, probably in the mid-'20's, replacing with a new build of the shuttle engine.  So right now, we're still going through the old engines with the new controllers installed.    Host:  Actually, we do have some audio from that that I really want to play.  It's, this is the hot fire test at Stennis, so if you're listening right now, be prepared because it's going to be very loud.     [ Engine Sounds ]    Host:  So that was the hot fire test, and what, you're looking at what components?   Are you looking at temperature?  Are you looking at propulsion, efficiency?  What are the main things that you really want to get out of this test?    David Smith:   Well, I think the biggest one is, how's the turbo machinery going?  You know, if you have turbine blades going at like 3000 rpm and you're spitting out all that fuel at the same time, how is that working out?  Is it meeting all the parameters?  Is, like you said, that's the temperature?  How does it run through its life cycle for that eight-minute burn?  That's a long time to run an engine.    Host:  Yeah.    David Smith:   So especially, you know, before we launch, you know, the shuttle only had three of these engines firing.  Now, we're going to have four of them.  So again, that's a unique configuration.  So making sure, [inaudible] how these engines will play together will be an important part of the test as well.    Host:  Did you ever get to see any of these tests in person -- structural tests, hot fire tests, anything like that?    David Smith:   Yes.    Host:  Is it really, really loud?    David Smith:   Well, the Stennis tests, you can get really close to it--    Host:  Oh, really?    David Smith:   Because, you know, it has the flume that comes out the side.  And you can get close to a cyclone fence.  In fact, you can taste the exhaust because, you know, oxygen and hydrogen comes together and forms water.    Host:  Right.    David Smith:   So that, and you have the sprinkler system that's cooling it down.  So you get both the sound, right, you get the visual of the flames, and then you get the taste.  [laughs] So I don't think you can do that anywhere else.  You certainly can't get the taste at Kennedy, so Stennis is really a remarkable opportunity when they do those test fires there.    Host:  Does it -- I'm imagining like a hot shower or something, just like really--    David Smith:   Well, remember, Stennis is pretty humid because it's in Mississippi, so--    Host:  Oh, yeah.    David Smith:   It's going to feel like a hot shower, but, [laughs] yeah.    Host:  Okay, so I'm, a curious thing -- how does a hot fire test taste?    David Smith:   Yeah, it has a taste to it.    Host:  [laughs] So what about the flight hardware for EM1?  Where are some of those components?    Paul Bookout:  Right now, the Orion stage adapter, that's where the 13 CubeSets are going to be housed during launch on EM1.    Host:  Oh, yeah.    Paul Bookout:  It's currently at Marshall Space Flight Center.  And at the end of, beginning, I'm sorry, of April, it's planned to ship down on the Super Guppy, which is a large carrier aircraft, down to KSC for processing.  And once it's down there when we're about six months to launch, that's when the secondary payloads will be integrated into that before stacked on the vehicle.  The interim cryogenic propulsion stage, of course, is finished.  It was, again, up in Decatur and is already down at KSC doing other final preps on that.  The launch vehicle stage adapter, which is being developed at Marshall by Lockheed Martin, they, the primary structure is complete, and they're doing spray foam insulation on the vehicle right now.  Again, that's also to help with acoustics aspects of the inside of that, inside of the LVSA.    Host:  Oh, that's right.    Paul Bookout:  The core stage, of course, the major components, as David said, the tank, the different tanks will be set up, sent up here for testing.  And once they're done testing, they'll be sent back down to Michoud and assembled.  And then, the main engines will come over from Stennis and assembled into the full core.  That's the liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen inner tank and the engines.  Then, it'll be sent back over to Stennis.  As David mentioned earlier, each engine, it would be separately tested, but then all four of these will be tested as, in flight configuration down there at Stennis.  So we're running them through the full cycle of, as we're integrating.  We're testing as we're putting it together.    Host:  That's right.    Paul Bookout:  So we understand that, as we assembled it, is it still operating the way we expected it to?    Host:  So then, will you, will it be built at Kennedy because that's when it's going to be launched?    David Smith:   Assembled.    Host:  I'm sorry, yeah.    David Smith:   It's built in Michoud, tested at Stennis, and then assembled at Kennedy.    Host:  Assembled at Kennedy.    Paul Bookout:  So the solid rocket motors, again, all the segment are, the five segments -- total of ten, five on each side -- have already been cast.  They're in final prep for shipping down to KSC on the rail system.  And then, just at, similar to shuttle program, once they've reached KSC, they'll be stacked in the VAB one segment at a time, and then the core stage will come in and be connected in the center between them.  Then, you have your upper stage or the ICPS, where, I'm sorry, you'll have your LVSA, launch vehicle stage adapter.  Then, you'll have your Orion -- let me just start over.  Once the core has been installed, then you'll have the launch vehicle stage adapter installed.  Then, you'll have your upper stage or the ICPS.  And then, on top of that, you'll have the Orion stage adapter where the secondary payloads are.  And then, Orion will come in and make, complete the stack.    Host:  All in this, in the Vertical Assembly Building?    Paul Bookout:  Yes.  Yeah.  Remember, it will built to assemble the Saturn V rocket, and--    Host:  Yeah.    Paul Bookout:  We're about that same size, so [laughs] there's plenty of room in there.    Host:  That's right.  It's, going back to that, actually, I don't think we've talked about it on the podcast.  The Vertical Assembly Building is, as you can probably tell from the way that this is being assembled, it's gigantic.  But it's so big, right, that it has its own weather system that you have to kind of worry about, right?  Is that right?    David Smith:   Yeah, it's--    Paul Bookout:  Yes.    David Smith:   Tall enough where, you know, everything that gets up in there can form its, it could rain a little bit sometimes--    Paul Bookout:  Yes.  Form clouds up there.    David Smith:   Yes.    Host:  Wow.  And then, the, you have these giant doors that's going to open, and then you'll just sort of roll the rocket out.    David Smith:   But one big change is, if you recall, so it's really interesting.  You know, a lot of that building was not changed from Saturn V. They only used two of the bays.  There's four for shuttle.  So they took out the platforms that were for Saturn and put in some shuttle platforms.  But for Saturn, excuse me, for Block 1B, they had to do a lot more changes to that.  So they had to replace all the platforms for that, and they actually removed a whole bunch of Saturn V, your equipment that had been left, abandoned in place.  So it's, that building has really changed from what it was during the shuttle era.    Host:  So it's really been reconstructed to fit the SLS.  That's really the main--    David Smith:   Yes.    Host:  The thing that's going on right now in the VAB.  Is it--    David Smith:   Right.    Host:  Is it completed, or is it still going on?    David Smith:   The platforms are completed.    Paul Bookout:  Completed.    David Smith:   For [inaudible] 1, Block 1.    Paul Bookout:  For Block 1, okay.    Host:  Right.    Paul Bookout:  Yeah.  And, you know, for SLS, there's still a lot of work at KSC being performed too.  It's just not the launch vehicle and all of its hardware for EM1.  It's KSC has to go through a redesign on a lot of their components.  As David just said, the VAB and all the platforms to be able to reach the hardware where you're stacking SLS.  Also, the crawler transporter that takes the mobile launch platform, which has the SLS rocket on -- originally, the Saturn V rocket -- has to be upgraded to fit the SLS rocket.  So, in addition, out at the launch pad, they're redoing the flame trenches, re-bricking them because it's going to have a lot more powerful rockets since the S, you know, since the shuttle program.  In addition, they're, they have to have a lot bigger water suspension system, you know, because at a lot more power than what shuttle was going through.    David Smith:   Called rainbirds after the sprinklers.  Big rainbirds.    Host:  Rainbirds.    David Smith:   Yeah, they kind of go, click, click, click, click, click, on the lawn, but this time, they do it on the engines and stuff.    Host:  Oh.  [laughs]    Paul Bookout:  So, you know, the water suspension, suppression system is to help with not just the heat but, also, the sound that these rockets, engines, and solid rocket motors, when they ignite, they're very loud.  They send out a shock wave.  And if you didn't have the water there to suppress or dilute that sound, that would just bounce back off the hard surface up into the vehicle and could damage the vehicle.  So it's just not for flame.  It's also to protect the vehicle from itself on the acoustics.    Host:  Okay.  That's the, so that's the suppression system?    Paul Bookout:  Correct.  The water that you usually see that starts a couple seconds right before ignition.    Host:  Actually, I think we do have some audio of that.  I don't think this one's quite as loud as a hot fire test, but let's listen to that.  This is what the suppression is going to sound like.     [ Engine Sounds ]    Host:  And those are the, that's the clicks, right?  That's the, I guess it's basically just like a giant--    David Smith:   Sprinkler system.    Host:  Sprinkler system.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.    Paul Bookout:  Yes.    Host:  Rocket-size sprinkler system.  So you're going to take it from the VAB, and I wanted to get, circle back on that because I think I was calling it Vertical -- is it Vehicle Assembly?    David Smith:   Vehicle Assembly.    Host:  Vehicle?  So I was getting that wrong.  It's Vehicle Assembly Building.  You bring it out to a launch pad, and is it going to launch on the same pad that the Saturn V was launching?    David Smith:   Yes.    Host:  Okay, so that's 39--    David Smith:   In fact, I think -- well, I'm not sure if it's A or B--    Host:  A or B.    David Smith:   But the one that we, that NASA kept, they totally revamped the equipment underneath that concrete mound.    Host:  Yeah.    David Smith:   And it's, there's a lot of [inaudible] and electrical equipment that's there in, the remnants from Saturn V, there's still a rubber room.  If you know, that's where the, if someone was trapped at the pad, you'd have a safe place in there.  So that's still in that same area, which they've now made a historic area, which is kind of interesting.  But they, for the first time in 50 years, have to clean out all the old equipment, totally revamp that launch pad for SLS.  So it's brand new and ready to go.  It's really impressive.    Host:  So the, what's being suppressed over at this launch pad by that suppression system, is it, is the solid rocket boosters, right, and then are the engines firing at the same time?    David Smith:   Yes.    David Smith:   These RS-25--    Paul Bookout:  Correct.    Host:  Engines?    Paul Bookout:  So--    Host:  Everything's all at once?    Paul Bookout:  Right.  Actually, the -- sorry.  Actually, the main engines ignite first because we want to make sure all of those are operational and working at peak efficiency because once you start the solid rocket motors, you got to launch because you can't turn off solid rocket motors.  So you want to make sure your other four engines are operating nominally, and then you ignite your solid rocket motors.    Host:  So we've done some testing with the, with these, the main engines, right?  The RS-25's?    Paul Bookout:  Correct.  Yes.  Also, we have done full-scale testing of the solid rocket motors out there at Orbital ATK in Utah, where they actually constrain him, lay him on the ground sideways, and constrain him, and actually fire, do test fires out there at Utah.    Host:  Ooh, I've seen that.  They actually had a HDR video I think of that -- high dynamic range or something.    Paul Bookout:  Yes.    Host:  Yeah, and it was super cool to see.  But then, also, just the test itself, actually--    Paul Bookout:  Yeah, I've been out there for a couple launches, and it's kind of unique because, with shuttle launch, you listen to the sound, and it's, you know, launching, so it's, after just a few seconds, it, the sound's gone.  Where solid rocket motor is, it's operates for two minutes, so you're sitting there feeling that whole sound, you know, [laughs] for two minutes, and it's a really exciting experience to be out there.    Host:  How did it feel?  Did it feel like you were at a loud concert, or even worse than that?    Paul Bookout:  Well, you're usually about a mile or so away.    Host:  A mile, okay.    Paul Bookout:  So, you know, just for safety reasons and everything.    Host:  That's, yeah.    Paul Bookout:  So you kind of get to see it off in the distance a little bit, but, yeah, you still feel it and hear it, yeah.  And it's kind of unique because you see the smoke, the engines fire off, and the smoke coming out, and then, a couple seconds later, that's when you feel it.  So--    Host:  How about the RS-25's?  Do you feel those too, or not as much?  Were out at the RS-25 test?    David Smith:   Yeah, yeah.  Well, the static firing, yeah, you feel it in your, you can get close for that, and you feel it in your stomach.  I mean, it's very visceral, the shaking of your, of that sound, so, yeah, you won't forget it once you've had it.    Host:  That was the sound we played earlier, right?    David Smith:   Right.    Host:  Okay.  I think the one we still have is the solid rocket booster, I think.  Okay, let's play that one.  This is the one that Paul was talking, the one out in Utah.    >> T minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, fire.     [ Engine Sounds ]    Host:  Okay, so that was the test from out in Utah, and if you really, if you turned up the volume on your, on the podcast, you can really feel it.  I listened to some of, I would listen to this in the car or hook it up to a nice speaker because you can really feel it there.  So those, that's all of those -- the solid rocket boosters, the RS-25, and the suppression systems.  So let's go back to the stages and sort of recap the, I guess the stages of all of these engines firing.  What's that look like?    David Smith:   Right.  So, you know, the term \"stage\" means that you have a single entity that provides an impulse for a period of time and then is thrown away.    Host:  Okay.    David Smith:   So in the olden days, so that would be Saturn, you know, you'd say Saturn was a three-stage vehicle, right.  It had the first stage, the second stage, and then third stage was the injection stage that took, you know, Apollo and the land to the Moon.  For both shuttle and for SLS, we really don't, can't call it three stages because these stages work together, which is kind of like they're two-and-a-half stages.  So what that means is the core, and, as Paul said, the core starts a little bit earlier, but they're essentially the same time.  The core and the booster, the solid rocket motors, boosters, excuse me, turn on at the same time.  So they're ignited, and that's the one-and-a-half stage--    Host:  Okay.    David Smith:   Because what happens?  After two minutes, the boosters fall off and the core continues, so that's the half stage, in a sense, the boosters.  Now, the core continues.  And then, finally, the core is expended after eight minutes.  It's disposed of in the ocean.  And then, you have the upper stage -- in this case, the second of the one-and-a, two-and-a-half stages -- fires to get you to your destination.  So you could still call it a three-stage system, but because some of the stages work together they're not really separate stages.  So it gets a little confusing.  So that's why you really don't hear, that's why people use the term \"upper stage\" these days and not \"third stage\" or \"second stage\" [laughs] because even the expendable vehicles have multiple solids on them, and so they have the same issues.  So that's the difference in staging today.  And it's more effective to do it this way as well.    Host:  It's more effective, I guess is it from the perspective of, oh, you can turn this off, you want to make sure everything's working?  Is it I guess more reliable?  That's why it's more effective?    David Smith:   Well, it's more effective because you use the power where you need it.  At, you know, at sea level, you need the most thrust, so you combine everything together to get you out of the gravity well of Earth.  So there's an efficiency with that system that, you know, is improved, is an improvement upon what was done for Saturn and other rockets before then?    Host:  Okay.  So how about the, we're talking about different configurations too -- Block 1, Block 1B -- and how they're going to be different and just sort of evolve.  Paul, I think you said you had some secondary payloads I think on 1B.    Paul Bookout:  Yes, that we're planning for.    Host:  That we're planning for, okay.    Paul Bookout:  So, you know, currently, on commercial launch vehicles, CubeSets usually don't have propulsion sets, and they're really going to low Earth orbit or geosynchronous orbit.    Host:  Yeah.    Paul Bookout:  And they're pretty much just deployed in those locations, so they don't need a secondary or propulsion system to get to where they need to.  On EM1, this is the first opportunity for a secondary payload to be able to have propulsion systems and going to get access to deep space because we're giving them the initial thrust or velocity to get out going to the Moon or into deep space.  They only need smaller propulsion system to change their trajectory or where they want to go.  So it's, you know, this will be the game changer for secondary payloads.  I mean, this is first-time opportunity for these small, little, shoe-size, shoebox-size payloads to be able to get out into deep space.    Host:  Yeah, and do some great stuff -- orbiting the Moon, land on the Moon.  You got some--    Paul Bookout:  Right.    Host:  Great stuff happening in some of these--    Paul Bookout:  Right.    Host:  Secondary payloads.    Paul Bookout:  As I mentioned in Part 1, EM1's kind of discovering that, well, they really want to be a little bit bigger so they can have a little bit larger propulsion system.  So instead of getting off at we call bus stop one right in the middle of the Van Allen belt, they'd like to get off at bus stop two or a little bit past so they don't have to worry about the radiation effects on their systems as much.  But they can't do it because they don't have the propulsion system big enough to change their direction that they want to go.  So on EM2, because it's a more powerful rocket, there's opportunity for additional mass allocations for secondary payloads.  The mass allocation is the mass that's left over that the primary or co-manifested payload doesn't need the full capability of the rocket, so we can use that additional up mass for secondary payloads.  So we're offering actually from a 6U- up to a 12U- and even a 27U-size secondary payload.   That's huge for secondary payloads wanting to be able to get out into deep space.  This allows them to have more power systems, more advanced telemetry, communications, and especially larger propulsion systems so they can get out into different destinations and do all this great science that they want to do in these smaller, less expensive packages.    Host:  Actually, that blends in nicely to drawing comparisons with SLS to other heavy-lift rockets because SLS is going to be gigantic and take these very, very large payloads.  What's the difference between SLS capabilities and some other heavy lift rockets like Delta IV Heavy or Falcon Heavy?  Why wouldn't you use just the heavy rockets?  Why do you need SLS?    Paul Bookout:  Existing commercial rockets, they're not destinations going into deep space.  They're mainly going into low Earth orbit or geosynchronous orbit.  So for a secondary payload to get out into deep space, they'd have to be pretty big, you know, to have a propulsion system larger than a 27U.  So the uniqueness of flying on SLS if you want to get out into deep space is that you don't have to have a huge satellite or, and propulsion system.  SLS is providing that initial kick or velocity to get you out in the general direction you want to go.  And then, you'd have a smaller propulsion system to be able to get out there.  So overall, it's a lot less expensive.  And again, SLS is giving these small CubeSets the opportunity to get onto deep space.    Host:  And also, the fact that it's human rated, right.  The fact that you can actually put people on it and bring them far into space, right?    Paul Bookout:  Right.    Host:  Kind of a big thing.    Paul Bookout:  Definitely, yes.    Host:  Is it the only one that's rated for human, for deep space?    David Smith:   Well, it's the only launch vehicle today that's being designed specifically for that.  There's--    Host:  I see.    David Smith:   You could make the argument that a Boeing CST-100 capsule flying on a Falcon, excuse me, on a Atlas is a human-rated system.  It's not really.  It's an amalgam.  And by the way, that's aimed at LEO.  So they--    Host:  I see.    David Smith:   You know, it, yes, we are the only ones that are being, designing specifically for that, and it's for safety reasons.    Host:  So it has to really meet these standards.  It has to be redundant.  It has to, and the SLS is the big, deep-space rocket that has the standards, has the capabilities, and is going to get you farther.    David Smith:   Right.    Host:  Ultimately.    Paul Bookout:  Exactly.  And, you know, to be that safe vehicle for launching humans into space, deep space, you know, we have to have these built-in, redundant systems.  We have to do all these testing throughout the whole build of the system.  You know, of course, that's a little penalty that we have to have additional mass to be able to have this redundancy, have this extra safety aspects of this vehicle.  So that, of course, goes right in against being able to have a larger mass, up mass capability.  But we're doing this for human exploration, not robotics exploration, so we're, we have to take those extra steps to make it safe.    Host:  That's right.  So what's the benefit of having this large up mass versus just launching a bunch of rockets with smaller masses?    David Smith:   Right.  We, what's often not fully appreciated is, for human spaceflight, for long duration, you can put together a whole bunch of little modules for humans, but think about it like this: Every time you put together a module, it has to have a hatch.  Maybe it has to have two.  It has to have a life support system.  It has to have a power system, a thermal system.  It has to be able to operate autonomously until another small module is joined to it.  So you can make a lunar orbiting platform or a Mars deep-space transport out of many small modules brought up over time for that many vehicles, but the problem is it becomes sub optimized.  You end up paying maybe 50% more mass for all the structure you don't really have to have.  Plus, now, you have many duplicative subsystems for many modules that have to all function flawlessly together and have to wait in space while other modules come up over time and to be joined together.  So when you think about this, coming up with this giant, origami-type space station that's deployed over years from many small modules compared to one flight or maybe two flights bringing up a very large module that does everything in one reliable, tested on the ground type of human habitation system, it becomes almost a no-brainer, right.    [laughs] If you want to make sure your people are alive over time, you really want that kind of system.  Only SLS right now is sized to do that.  Other guys can certainly deliver those pieces, but they'd be a lot smaller and you'd have these issues that we just talked about.    Host:  That's right.  And I guess it kind of opens up some opportunities for just, because you can have a larger up mass, because you have more space within the fairing to put things--    David Smith:   Right.    Host:  Now, you have a lot less constraints because even -- I'm going to go back to James Webb, right.  James Webb is a wonderful telescope, but it was constrained by what it can--    David Smith:   The volume of the fairing.    Host:  Yeah, so it had to come up with this folding technique to pretty much fit inside the fairing.  Otherwise, you couldn't launch the satellite.  But I guess you can design, you have a little bit more freedom of design with something a little bit larger, right?    David Smith:   Or if you wanted to scale up the James Webb design, let's say that was the perfect design for telescopes--    Host:  Yeah.    David Smith:   You could make a telescope that's five times larger with the large fairing that, you know, larger fairings that SLS could fly.  So it opens up a whole, either you can have a non-origami type, folding-out type telescope, and it's all great, or, if you want to still do that, it gets you something even larger.  So the scale is, the current fairing is, in some cases, the ten-meter fairing would be five times larger than the largest existing fairing today--    Host:  Whoa.    David Smith:   If we could produce that.  And that's, you know, we're talking a seven-story building could fit inside that ten, you know, [laughs] that long, the long, ten-meter, diameter, meter, diameter fairing.    Host:  All right.  Just launch my house into space and just--    David Smith:   There you go.    Host:  Kind of get a nice view.    David Smith:   Well, it'd be your condo building that it would launch--    Host:  [laughs] Condo building.    David Smith:   Not your house.    David Smith:   Even bigger.    Host:  Yes.    Host:  So I kind of wanted to end with just sort of a scope of, we're kind of setting up a scene for what this rocket is capable of.  Looking towards the future, and, David, you kind of pointed towards this, was this is a 50-year rocket, right.  This is something that we're planning on using for a long time for many missions.  How do you see this rocket being used?  Like, take us into the future.  What is this rocket going to give us?    David Smith:   So, you know, obviously, the lunar orbiting platform would be the first step.  Let's--    Host:  Yeah.    David Smith:   Improve the technologies in our backyard we call the Moon.  We use those technologies then to extrapolate a system that can go to Mars safely and start, you know, bringing Mars into this human ring of habitation in our solar system.  Some of the more exciting things in tandem are these robotic missions.  There's the idea that we can send, because we can go so fast, we, so fast into the deeper reaches of the solar system, that within a five-year mission, we can send out a telescope that could go 200 astronomical units out from the Sun, and actually come back and aim at the Sun, and use the Sun as a gravitational lens to see exoplanets on the other side of the Sun.  So we could make the world's largest telescope by having one lens on one side of the Sun and using the Sun's gravity as the other lens, and now seeing planets like we could've never seen them before, all because SLS can send that telescope out in a time frame that we can actually operation a mission, versus, you know, remember, Voyager took 30 years to get outside to, close to the heliosphere.  So, you know, it's a, it's such a game changer that the real issue with SLS is we haven't thought about all the stuff we can do with it yet, you know.   It kind of bends our imagination in a new way that we haven't been thinking of.  Another example is interstellar probe.  Again, sending something beyond the heliosphere now.  You know, instead of the Voyager drifting out there over 30 to 40 years, we can send something out there in 20 years to break the barrier and see what's on the other side of the heliosphere.  And we can do that in an active manner versus we're just getting little pulses from Voyager now still coming back.  We can be much more active in that.  So a lot of places like JPL are investigating the capability of SLS in ways that we never even thought of recently.  So we're just on the very edge of discovering what we can do with the system.    Host:  Unbelievable.  And this just kind of opens up the plan for exploring beyond low Earth orbit, right.  You've said the first step for human exploration is going towards the Moon, but now you have a bunch of Moon missions.  You kind of develop your skills.  You got this Lunar Orbital Platform, the gateway that's going to bring us, the truck stop [laughs] that we call it--    David Smith:   Right.    Host:  Is going to take us further out.  And I'm guessing this will be used for the future human missions too beyond this first step.    David Smith:   Well, if we go to, we talked about I think in the earlier episode, nuclear thermal propulsion.    Host:  Yeah.    David Smith:   If we're able to employ that for human transport, we can reduce times to where we can send people maybe even ultimately beyond Mars.  So, but only SLS with its capability to loft both mass and volume, when the nuclear, this nuclear thermal propulsion requires large amounts of hydrogen, which requires volume, only the SLS can give us that capability to even see if some of these technologies are usable, versus just relying on the same old technologies as the last 50 years.  So we have so much promise in front of us with this.    Host:  Unbelievable.  You guys are getting me all excited for what's to come.  I just want to take a time machine, and jump, you know, 20 years into the future, and just see this rocket has done.    Paul Bookout:  Yep, you're not the only one.    David Smith:   [laughter] Take us with you.    Host:  Yeah, that's--    David Smith:   We want to be there too.    Host:  Unbelievable.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host):  Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center Episode 55, \"Living Off the Land.\"  I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today.  So in this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, all the coolest people.  We bring them right here in the show and talk about all the coolest information that's going on right here at NASA.  So today, we're talking about in-situ resource utilization.  Here, we call it ISRU.  This is the ability to find and use natural resources beyond Earth.  I'm especially excited for this episode because ISRU is how we're going to terraform other planets and make them habitable for humans to live.  Planet colonization opens up a whole new world of space exploration.  How will we derive the resources we need from the bare landscape of the moon?  How will the first Martian colonies survive?  Such an unforgiving environment.  And most importantly, will they miss Netflix?  So today, we're talking to John Gruener and Steve Hoffman.  John Gruener has been at NASA since 1986.  He currently works in Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science.   This is the ARES division, A-R-E-S.  He works on advanced mission planning for the future human and robotic exploration of the moon and Mars.  In the past, he's worked for mineralogy laboratories developing a mineral-based substrate for the plant growth and regenerative life support systems.  He also supported the Mars Exploration Rover Missions of Spirit and Opportunity.  Gruener can be described as not only a rocket scientist but also a systems engineer, a space farmer and a planetary scientist.  Steve Hoffman received a bachelor's, master's and doctorate in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering from the University of Illinois and he has 35 years of experience in the space industry.  He's been involved with everything from program management to spacecraft design to orbital mechanics.  And he now supports the Exploration Mission Planning Office here at the Johnson Space Center.  And he supports a variety of missions for human exploration beyond low Earth orbit with a particular focus on Mars.  Obviously, both of these guys are the real deal.  So with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with John Gruener and Dr. Steve Hoffman.   Enjoy.    [ Music ]   Let's do it, yes.  Seriously, let's go straight from there because that leads into -- that's the whole point.  ISRU spells out in-situ resource utilization, right?    John Gruener: That's right.    Host: It just means living off the land.  You got, you only have so much you can bring so what is there that you can utilize, that you can turn into something useful?  And it sounds like you already have a lot of ideas about ISRU, right?    John Gruener: Yes, for both the moon and Mars.    Host: Both the moon and Mars.    John Gruener: You know, Steve just mentioned the atmosphere on Mars.  Of course, the moon has no atmosphere.  And so what you're looking at are the rocks and soils are for the longest idea, the longest time, we thought, you know, that's what we're going to use on the moon, the rocks and the soil.  And just recently, within the last 10 or 15 years or so, we've had measurements of water ice in the polar regions of the moon, right.  So now, it's not just rocks and soils anymore.  Now, it's ice.  And of course, water is going to be the most critical thing out there in space for people.  A lot of people say it's going to be more valuable than gold.  Because, of course, we need water or we die fairly quickly.  You can split water into hydrogen and oxygen and we need that oxygen to breathe or we die very quickly.  And hydrogen and oxygen are great rocket propellants.  So water is going to be, you know, hugely important out there and there are science fiction TV shows on television right now and at the movie theaters that focus on this theme of resources and people battling over resources and all that.   So they're going to be critically important.  So we're really happy we found water on the moon because there's a way to make water on the moon out of the rocks and the dirt, right.    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: The more --    Host: The rocks and the dirt that are everywhere or just in the polar regions?    John Gruener: All over the moon.    Host: Oh.    John Gruener: Right, yeah, so the Apollo astronauts brought back about 800 pounds of rocks and soil when I was a little kid.  And scientists measured those and you learn about all the chemical elements and the minerals, right.  So it's really the mineralogy that's important.  And most of the minerals on Mars or on the moon are silicate minerals, right.  And so, part of those silicate minerals is a lot of oxygen, all right, like 40, 45% by weight oxygen just sitting in those minerals.    Host: Wow.    John Gruener: The problem is you have to break the chemical bonds.  So those oxygen are bonded to silicones and are bonded to irons and magnesiums and calciums.  So you got to break these chemical bonds which require lots of energy, okay.  And so it's like, well, yeah.  We can make water on the moon out of the minerals.  The hydrogen comes from the solar wind.  So since the moon has no magnetic field like the Earth does, you know, in school, we all learned about this thing called the geomagnetic tails or the radiation from the sun hits our magnetic fields and then kind of goes around, kind of like a teardrop shape.  So they -- the magnetic field protects it from all that.  Well, on the moon, since there's no magnetic field, that solar wind is just hitting the surface of the moon all the time.  And a huge constituent of the solar wind is hydrogen, right.  And so you have hydrogen slamming into the moon and being retained by the soil and the minerals on the moon.  You have oxygen.  So now, you have all you need to make water, right.   And not only are we finding out that there is water ice in the polar regions but we're finding out there's not quite water but hydroxyl.  So that's kind of a water ion, O and H, but it could be water as well but mostly hydroxyl.  Just by the combination of that solar wind when hitting these minerals, finding oxygen and making these little bonds.  So there's small amounts of hydroxyl and possibly water all over the moon.  And of course, we didn't know any of this until we started putting robotic satellites in orbit starting in the mid-90s and then all the way up today.  We have lunar reconnaissance orbiter around the moon right now.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: And one of the instruments on there is the neutron spectrometer looking for that water ice.  We have a UV spectrometer looking for that water frost, you know, in some of these regions.  So water is critical and we have it at the moon now.  So that would probably be one of the very things people working in the in-situ resource utilization field, the ISRU field -- water production will probably be one of the first things people will try to do.  Because if you have water, you can now sell water, right?  And you don't really care what your customers use it for.  If they want to use it for rocket propellant, that's fine.  They want to use it for life support consumables, that's fine.  But just having that commodity of water and being able to sell it or use it is going to be really important.    Host: Well, first, you got to make it and then you can do the other stuff.    John Gruener: You have the other stuff --    Steve Hoffman: But see, that's a -- there's sort of a chicken-and-egg problem there, too.  If you're going to sell it, you have to have a customer for it but the customers aren't going to show up until they know that they have this stuff there.    Host: So you've got to have the capability first.    Steve Hoffman: Well, it's a chicken-and-egg problem.    Host: Yeah.    Steve Hoffman: So who now, it's somebody has got to start.  One, there's got to be either a customer there with a demand for it and then somebody will follow and fill the demand.  Or somebody's going to demonstrate that they can do this and have that commodity ready to go or at least have the technology ready to go.  So that the customers, the people who are going to generate demand will feel confident enough that they can, you know, invest whatever else they have to do to go there and use this stuff.  The way we usually get around that is some, usually a government or a research field of one sort or another breaks or takes the first leap.  Some organization that has enough resources that they can invest in something like this without having to answer to stockholders or other investors for a return on that investment.  And demonstrate that they can do this sort of stuff.  Now, so there's a big risk but there's a big payoff in that sort of thing.  And so whoever demonstrates this first and demonstrates not only can you do it which we kind of know we can do it, but has -- puts that chemical plant in place that actually takes all these dirt and other things and turns it into a bottle of water, that organization is going to get a big payoff.   Now, if it's a government -- governments usually are magnanimous about this and turn it over to somebody else to use.  But there could be other people or could be other investors, people with enough resources to do this on their own, that they may just go off and do it on their own.  And you know, they'll reap the reward in doing that.    Host: Now, is the reward specifically for space travel or are there Earth applications that may be part of this investment, I guess?    John Gruener: It's tough to make people who looked at that for a long time and it's tough to make a case, mainly because of the transportation cost.  You know, if you're talking about -- so take water as our example again.  You can go down to the grocery store and buy, you know, a case of water for five bucks.  If you had to pay for all the transportation cost to get water from the moon, back here, put it in bottles.  It'd be a lot more than five bucks for that case of water.  So that's what I mentioned before, sort of a rule of thumb for ISRU is to use this stuff as close to where you're producing it as possible.  So you minimize, if not eliminate, that transportation cost piece of the whole equation.    Host: So he's talking about, so when you're talking ISRU, you're talking about turning, getting water specifically from the moon.  It's not like you can take that same technology of creating water on the moon and bring it to Earth because the moon has -- is made of different things.    John Gruener: And we don't need to.    Host: And we don't need to.    John Gruener: We are a water world, right?    Host: Yeah but still extracting -- well, I mean, maybe not.  Maybe not water in this case.  You're right, because we're a water world.  But extracting resources from there.  They're living off a land component.    John Gruener: So there are other resources people do talk about bringing back to the Earth.  One of them is helium-3.  Helium is also a part of the solar wind so it constantly is embedded into the lunar surface.  And some day, you know, if we can ever develop fusion reactors versus our fission reactors that we have today, the people that work in that industry say that helium-3 is a great fuel for fusion reactors, right.  And so that's something that somebody like Apollo 17 astronaut Jack Schmidt, he likes to talk a lot about helium-3.  The Chinese National Space Agency right now and the Russians also talk about helium-3.  My time with helium-3 is when I was in college back in the '80s, we were -- they were, you know, digging a big hole at the University of Texas and they were going to put a Tokamak reactor and fusion energy wasn't going to be solved.  Well, here we are in 2018 and we're still not close to producing fusion or you know, making fusion reactors that really work.   So helium-3 is talked a lot about.  You'll see that in the press, you know, in bringing back that to Earth.  Some people talk about bringing a platinum group, metals back to the Earth primarily from asteroids and rare Earth metals that you use in the semiconductor business in batteries and things like that, you know.  Because those are hard to find and precious around the Earth.  So those are the kind of things people do talk about bringing back to the Earth.  Not so much water.    Host: So it's not necessarily the resource itself from -- I guess, is it fair to say that there's plenty of helium-3 to provide fuel?  It's just the technology isn't quite there yet to actually do something with it.    John Gruener: To do something with it, that's right.  So the helium-3 is sitting there on the moon, waiting for us.    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: Waiting for the technologies to mature.  And I don't remember, Steve, maybe you know that somebody back in the, you know, when the Shuttle was flying, they talked about a Shuttle payload bay where the helium-3 would power the United States for, I don't know, how many days or months but it was, it was pretty incredible.    Host: Wow.    Host: So it's --    Steve Hoffman: Probably more than that.    John Gruener: Yeah, it's a pretty neat fuel source if we ever get that fusion reactor technology developed.    Steve Hoffman: It doesn't take much to generate a lot of power from nuclear sources like that.  So yeah, a Shuttle payload bay folder stuff would probably -- it's more like years or decades it could power.    John Gruener: So just to follow up on this water on the moon --    Host: Oh, yeah.    John Gruener: You know, the reason we like the pole so much is because water is already there in the form of ice, all right.  So we had a spacecraft called LCROSS.  It flew out to the moon with Lunar Reconnaissance over the back in 2009.  And LCROSS was a really fun little mission where people over at Ames Research Center, they had two spacecraft and they basically smashed one into a permanent shadowed, you know, permanently dark area of the moon where we're pretty sure there was water ice.  A plume of all sorts of volatiles escaped into space because of that high-energy crash.  Another spacecraft threw through the plume.  It measured what was in it.  And the most abundant compound was water, right.  So we have ground truth that there is water ice at the poles of the moon.  And the neat thing about that is we only have to heat the dirt up a few hundred degrees to volatilize or you know, get that water, melt it, vaporize it and collect it.   Earlier, we were talking about using the rocks and minerals and breaking chemical bonds.  That requires thousands of degrees of energy, huge amounts of kilowatts of power.  So the promise of the water ice at the moon is it's already there.  We can get to it with small amounts of energy versus the large amounts where you're breaking chemical bonds.  But the moon, the environment there in the polar regions very extreme.    Host: Yes.    John Gruener: I mean, in the -- so on the Earth, we have, you know, our axis of rotation is tilted and we have seasons.  And so, unfortunately, here in Texas, we're moving into summer because we're pointing at the sun.    Host: Oh, feeling it already.    John Gruener: Yeah, well so the moon's axis of rotation's almost perpendicular, straight up and down to the big ecliptic plane.  That plane where all the planets orbit the sun, right?  And so, you could imagine the moon at the equator, the energy from the sun, the sunlight is just coming straight overhead.  It's really intense.  But as you go up in the ladder to these are the North Pole or the South Pole, now the energy from the sun is more of a glancing blow.  And now you get to the very poles of the moon and now the energy of the sun is going parallel right across the surface.  I don't know if you remember your geometry class in high school?  But when the intersection of a curve and a line --    Host: Tangent?    John Gruener: The tangent, there you go.    Host: Oh, I remember.    John Gruener: That little bitty point, right?  So imagine you're sitting in a hole at the poles of the moon, a crater, if you will.  Well, that sunlight's going to cross parallel to the surface.  It's never going to get into your hole.    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: And for about two-and-a-half billion years now, we think there are these craters in the polar regions have been permanently shadowed, very, very cold.  I mean, colder than Pluto cold, you know.  People are always thinking Pluto is the coldest thing in the solar system because it's way out there.  But Pluto's actually receiving sunlight and reflecting that sunlight.  And that's why we can see Pluto.  These craters never get sunlight so we're talking, you know, 25, 30 Kelvin.    Host: Oh.    John Gruener: That's just barely over absolute zero.    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: All right.  So the challenge is from the engineering standpoint.  Great, we have water ice in these permanently dark, very, very cold places.  Now, build me a robot that can work in that environment, you know.    Host: So this is probably freezes that [inaudible].    John Gruener: Yeah, yeah.    Steve Hoffman: But these metals will just crystallize and you, they'll just shatter like a piece of glass.    Host: Wow.    Steve Hoffman: I mean, so those cold temperatures are part of the biggest deterrent from doing what can be as simple as heating up the soil and just collecting the vapor that comes off it.  So the technology of gathering that water is very simple but the materials that you need to survive in that environment are something that they're very challenging from what we can get out of it.    John Gruener: Yeah, folks out of the Jet Propulsion Lab are working on something called bulk metallic glass instead of metal so you can build gears and structural components out of this stuff and it can better withstand these really, really cold temperatures.  So scientifically, we know the stuff's there.  And we kind of have an idea of where to go.  Now, we don't really know how deep it goes into the subsurface.  All of our remote sensing instruments can only get down, you know, less than a meter.  The LCROSS impact probably went down only three to five meters.  So understanding the subsurface amount so in the mining world, they call it grade and tonnage, you know.  How pure is it and how much of it is there?    Host: Right.    John Gruener: Because a lot of it is going to have to be there to be economically feasible or if we're really going to use it for rocket propellants.  You know, if you have one cup of water out in the middle of the desert, that's not going to last you that long.  But if you have a whole oases out in the desert, that'll last you quite a while.    Host: Yeah, because if you're talking about a surface mission, let's say, you're bringing humans down to the surface, maybe near the poles.  I don't know if that would be feasible or if it would be too cold there.  But not necessarily in the crater where it's 30 Kelvin but if you're near the source of where you can produce the water, is there enough to get something out of it, to create enough oxygen, to create enough water and to create the propellant that we need?    John Gruener: That's what we have to find out and so, in the economic, you know, the mineral world of mining companies, you know, that phase is called prospecting.  And so, we have a lot of data sets from orbit from our remote sensing but we have to get robots down to the surface to do ground prospecting so we can get a better idea of the grade and tonnage of this stuff to see if it really even makes sense to pursue it.  But so you know, you talked about people landing.  I mentioned, you know, these holes, these craters at the polar regions that are permanently dark, permanently cold.  Well, so think just the opposite, so now I'm at that tangent point between the line of the circle and I'm not in the hole anymore.  But now, I'm on a mountain peak.  And what are you going to see?  You're going to see the sun just about all of the time, okay.  So there are a handful of locations both at the North and the South Pole that sees the sunlight almost 90% of the time.  So most places on the moon like all the places we visited with Apollo, you wind up with two weeks' worth of daylight followed by two weeks' worth of darkness, right.   And that's your typical lunar day on the moon, if you like.  And that's all because of the orbit of the moon around the Earth.  But again, when you get to the poles and you have that perpendicular axis of rotation, that whole two weeks of darkness and two weeks of sunlight goes right out the window and now it's all based on topography.  So on the high points, you'll get a lot of sunlight.  The low points, you'll get a lot of darkness.  So the idea is for people to land and work and live in the high points where there's sunlight.  And now, we can use solar rays, just you know, like on the space station, we have these really tall rectangular solar rays.  You put something like that on the surface of the moon at the poles and you know, you jack it up into the sky.  Now you can receive sunlight 100% of the time.    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: So the people are living in the sunlight, getting energy from the sun with solar rays.  So that's very low tech.  You know, we don't need nuclear reactors for that.  And then you're sending your robots into the dark to harvest the water ice.  That's kind of the grand picture someday.  But first, we have to do the prospecting to find the stuff in useful quantities.  We got to do the technology development.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: To see if your machines can even operate in those very cold temperatures.  And then we have to have the human systems as well.    Host: So where are we now?  You hinted at the beginning that we have been looking at ISRUs since the '80s.  But how about technology?  Have we sent anything into space?  Have we tested stuff from the ground?    John Gruener: Just we have one experiment.  I'll let Steve talk about this, getting ready to go to Mars on Mars 2020 called Moxie, right.  And it's all about making oxygen out of the atmosphere at Mars.  So you tell it.    Steve Hoffman: [Inaudible] well, to back up one step though.  The technologies that we're talking about using for many of these concepts, whether it's heating up or breaking up chemical bonds or just heating up the ground and capturing the water, a lot of that stuff is technology that's been used on Earth for, you know, decades, centuries --    John Gruener: Centuries.    Steve Hoffman: In some cases.    Host: Oh wow.    Steve Hoffman: So the --    John Gruener: But in space, nothing.  So we haven't done any of these demonstrations in space yet.  Moxie will be our first.    Steve Hoffman: So on Earth, we can afford to have giant chemical plants and when something breaks, it's very easy to go fix it.  When you send something into space, right now we don't, it's usually a robotic device without any people around.  And so if it breaks, you're done.  So we have to -- we have to -- and launching stuff off the surface of the Earth and getting it to some other destination requires a rocket of some size, usually quite large compared to the payload.  So when you talk about taking those technologies that have been used on Earth for centuries in some cases, and sending it somewhere else, now we're talking about the engineering to make that thing very small, very light and very reliable so that you can operate it for very long periods of time without -- with the expectation that it's not going to break.    John Gruener: And when I talk to school kids and I say, you know, we have hundreds of thousands of equations at NASA.  And fortunately, I've forgotten most of them.  Because I'm 57, I'm, you know, I'm going to be in this another five, six, 10 years maybe.  But the most simplest equation and the most simplest concept to remember is mass equals money, right.  If you want to send a lot of mass into space, you better have to have a lot of money, because you need this big rocket that Steve was talking about, right.  We never have a lot of money so we try to minimize our mass as much as possible.  So you're not going to see big front-end loaders like you know, you go to a construction site here on the Earth and you see these huge vehicles.  Big massive vehicles with big rippers and front-end loaders and drag lines.  We can't do that on the planets because we don't, we can't get all that mass to the planets in the first place.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: Way too expensive.  So our robots are going to be smaller, nimble, more agile, right.  And you're just going to have to accept a slower pace of accumulating the resources than we do here on Earth where we have these big monster vehicles that can, you know, dig up a whole baseball field in one big scoop.  We're just -- we don't have the -- you know, where the tyranny of the rocket equation.  We just don't have the money to afford a huge rocket to send big tractors and bulldozers to the planets.    Host: How nice it would be though to have a moon bulldozer.  That would be pretty nice.    John Gruener: That would be cool.    Steve Hoffman: All right, so he mentioned something called Moxie.    Host: Right, yeah.    Steve Hoffman: What are things on Mars that we have -- that's on Mars that we don't have on the moon is an atmosphere.  And that atmosphere is very thin compared to here on Earth.  It's -- to find a similar pressure and density here on Earth, you'd have to go out to an altitude of about 100,000 feet.  So it's very, very thin.  But it's there.  So that makes it something that we can use.  It's mostly carbon dioxide, about 95% carbon dioxide.  Most of the rest is nitrogen and then there's traces of other stuff.  So when we talked about using water for rocket propellant, we're also looking using that atmosphere to make at least part of rocket propellant for a human mission.  We can all see but you could also use that for robotic missions.  We'd like to do a sample return from Mars, for example.  So the rockets don't care if the payload on board is a rock or a human being.   It's just its mass that the rocket is moving around.    Host: Right.    Steve Hoffman: They both use rocket propellant.  Moxie is a way to get oxygen out of that carbon dioxide and with the idea that that would be half of the two kinds of rocket propellant that you need to get something off the surface.    John Gruener: And so for rocket propellants, you have a fuel and you have an oxidizer.  So here on the Earth, you know, we talked about earlier that Earth's a water world.  Well, here on Earth, we have oxygen in our atmosphere.  So the good old, you know, internal combustion engines in our cars and in our lawn mowers and everything else uses the oxygen in the atmosphere as an oxidizer to get that fuel oxidizer combination going.  And you get, you know, energy out of that.  But we don't have --    Host: But you can pull it straight from the atmosphere.    John Gruener: That's right.    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: That's right.  So we, you know, we don't need oxidizers here on the surface of the Earth.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: But we do out there on the planets and Steve, what's that gear ratio usually between oxidizer and propellant?  Like seven-to-one or six-to-one usually?    Steve Hoffman: It depends upon which combination you're using.  But it's mostly in the -- for the combinations that we want to use on Mars is mostly oxygen.  So it's to our benefit to be able to make oxygen there.    John Gruener: And even if you can't make the fuel there, you make the oxygen, you just satisfy the bulk of your propellant needs.    Steve Hoffman: And in this case, it's on, it's in the 70% to 80% range of the total mass that you need for a rocket to get off the ground.  So I can bring the 20% of fuel and in our case, what we're looking at now is methane.  But we'll make the oxygen while we're there.  We know where the atmosphere is.  It's everywhere.  So it doesn't restrict us to where we can land.  John was talking about these ice fields being at the poles.  So that constrains us to land at one of the pole on the moon if we want to use [inaudible] -- excuse me, if we want to use water.  On Mars, at least for the oxygen part, we can land wherever we want to.  And we can use a device similar to Moxie to pull that oxygen or pull the atmosphere into the device.  You separate out all the dust and the nitrogen and the other stuff that you don't want.  And you take that carbon dioxide and then you use processes that we understand well from doing the same thing on Earth.   Separate it into carbon monoxide and oxygen and keep the oxygen part.  And you'll let the other rest of it go.  So Moxie is the first.  We know how that technology works.  We haven't demonstrated that we know how to do it from a practical point of view in an environment like Mars.  So Moxie is being flown on Rover that's going to be launched in 2020.  It's job will be to do that actual demonstration that says, \"Okay, in this real environment with real dust and impurities and other things and temperatures, all that sort of stuff that goes into actually making this thing work for real will be there and we'll run Moxie to demonstrate that we can at least do that part of collecting the atmosphere, filtering out the stuff we don't want and then getting the oxygen out the back end that we can use.    Host: Is there a storing component?  You would grab the oxygen and then kind of put it into a tank?    Steve Hoffman: Eventually.    Host: Okay.    Steve Hoffman: I don't -- I think Moxie and now I'm trying to remember where Moxie -- I do not think will store that but eventually, we'll have to store it somewhere.    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: So at the very beginning, you know, we mentioned the prospecting part of finding resources.  The other part, the technology part is demonstrations.    Host: Yes.    John Gruener: So for the next decade, you know, that's kind of where we are in the world of resource utilization and understanding what resources are available on the moon or Mars.  It's all about prospecting and demonstrations and mostly robots.  You know, we won't have people on the moon for quite a while.  We won't have people on Mars even longer.  So it's going to be a lot of robotic technology demonstrations at sites where certain resources are where you know you can turn those resources into certain products.  You know, it's all about getting to the useful product eventually.    Steve Hoffman: But there -- so there's another example though of things that are going on, on Earth that will eventually adapt in some form for these other planets.  A lot of the mines, the big mines that you see on Earth are becoming more and more automated.  The trucks are driving around on their own.  There's no driver on board.  Some of the machinery that's digging things out of the ground are just supervisors.  Nobody in there pulling levers or steering the machine anymore.  It's somebody watching on the screen to make sure that it's digging in the right spot and hasn't gone off somewhere else where it's not supposed to be.  We can take that same kind of technology that we're learning how to do and working all the bugs out here on Earth, and then miniaturize it and improve its reliability.  And then we can send it off to the moon or Mars and have those robots do a lot of the work that used to take people here on Earth to do in a more intensive fashion.   Intensive in the sense that they had to have a lot more people to make this thing work.  Now I don't have to have a lot of people anymore.  And in fact, I've got the people here sitting on the Earth and instead of watching a mine that might be in Arizona somewhere which they can do, now I'm sitting on Earth and I'm watching a mine that's on the surface of the moon.  Or I'm sitting on Earth and I'm watching a mine that's working on the surface of Mars.  And until there's something that the robots themselves can't handle and we have to send people to correct that situation where there is something broke or something unexpected happened, we can sit here on Earth and we can have our minds working on these other planets, making these commodities that -- that will then be available when people actually do go there for whatever reason they're going there for.    Host: Right, so robotically, we would sort of develop the infrastructure to eventually support a human mission.  Assuming that if we do send humans to, let's just say, Mars in this example.  If we send humans to Mars to live, we can expect that the mining operations will have been tested, demonstrated and you have these tanks of oxygen and water and rocket propellant and everything.    Steve Hoffman: Well, we'd like to hope so.  But just like Moxie, the Mars environment is not the Earth environment.  So we'll have to do, as John said, we'll have to do demonstrations to convince ourselves that we know what we're talking about or we know we can do what we say we can do.  Then it's a question -- we're back to that chicken-and-egg kind of question.  When do you, when do I start building a mine because that's going to require a lot of investment to be able to do that, if there's nobody there?  I mean, if there's no -- if there's no demand on the moon or on Mars for this whatever you're making in this mine, why are you building the mine?    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: So there has, they're going to probably evolve or expand or get in place more or less together.  I mean, they'll probably be a little mine, a little group of people that get, turns into a bigger mine and a bigger group of people.  And they'll just kind of grow together as demand grows and the suppliers will have to grow with them and vice-versa.    Host: John, I wanted to ask you about the simulants that you're working on because --    John Gruener: You're right, I was just going to jump in here because --    Host: There you go.    John Gruener: -- we're talking about all these technology demonstrations in space.  And of course, when you're building hardware, you want to understand what's going to happen when it gets all dusty.  Are the hinges going to work?    Host: Right.    John Gruener: Or are the shock absorbers, things that move in and out, are they going to work?  And you know, though we brought back about 840 pounds of rocks and soil from the moon, we've never brought anything back from Mars.  Now, Mother Nature always done that for us through meteorites, right, so we have an idea of maybe what some of that stuff's like on Mars.  We also have our robots on Mars making those measurements.  But we don't just have planetary materials to give out to the technology world to help them with their machines in developing their robots.  So what we do in the planetary science world here in the Astromaterials Division at JSC, we look at what we found on the moon and Mars.  And we look at the chemistry and the mineralogy.  And then we look around the Earth, mainly the United States because that's where we are and we find rocks and minerals and soils that are similar in composition, similar in mineralogy and then we'll go and collect those in the fields.   We'll grind them up into you know, very, very tiny particles so that they mimic the particle size that are on the moon or Mars.  And now, we have a bucket of fake moon dirt or fake Mars dirt that we can give to our technologist to test their systems and to see how it's really going to work.  So you know, the challenge of that is you can't just go to the store and buy one bucket of moon simulant because the moon's a very diverse planetary body, just like Mars is.  And so, there are numerous different simulants you could design and you know, recipes, if you will, for certain processes.  You know, so like right now, we're working on a Mars simulant that simulates a very specific windblown deposit on Mars called Rocknest.  You know, our Curiosity Rover's on Mars.  It measured this dune-like looking thing that was called Rocknest.  They put it in an oven.  They cooked it and they wound up with about one to three weight percent water.    Host: All right.    John Gruener: So they said, \"Oh, cool.  There's water right there in the sand dunes of Mars, you know.\"  Now, of course, there's also water ice all over Mars.  So you know, water's going to be a lot easier on Mars than the moon.  That's for sure.    Host: Nice.    John Gruener: But the ISRU guys, the technologists wanted to design something where they could easily dig into a sand dune, cook it and boil the water out.  So we, you know, just recently were working on a simulant that will produce one to three weight percent water out of the same chemistry and mineralogy of Rocknest on Mars, right.  So that's a very specific simulant.  You look back at the moon in the night sky.  You see the dark areas.  You see those bright areas.  All those dark areas are just basaltic lava flows.  I mean, the same stuff that on the news right now coming out of the ground in Hawaii?    Host: Right.    John Gruener: Yeah, same stuff as that's those dark areas on the moon, all right.  And so, a lot of iron.  A lot of magnesium on the moon, something called titanium and a mineral called ilmenite.  So you know, everybody knows about titanium.  You know, that stuff's strong.  You see it advertised on TV.  Well, if you want to do a process to mine the dark areas of the moon or the Maria regions so its lava flows.  Now you're going to need a different simulant than you would, say, for the polar regions where now you're talking about the bright areas of the moon.  So you know, you look at the bright areas of the moon and that's not lava at all.  That's a feldspathic mineral called anorthosite.  So a lot of calcium and aluminum whereas the basalts were mostly, you know, iron and magnesium and things like that.  So the simulant business is kind of tricky because sometimes, NASA is really interested in the moon for a while.  And so we'll think about moon simulants.  And then sometimes, NASA is interested in Mars for a while and so we had to come up with Mars simulants, right.   And there's not just one simulant for the moon and one simulant for Mars.  There's all sorts of simulants for all sorts of processes.  So that's one of the things we do at the Astromaterials, you know.  We have the Mars scientists that are actually doing the experiments right now on Curiosity right in our building.  And so I work with them to find out, well, what is the chemistry and what is the mineralogy?  How can we find stuff like that here in the United States and make it available to our technologists?  So it's a pretty fun project.  It's a great mix of science and engineering.    Host: Yeah and you would think, you know, looking at the moon.  I mean, if you didn't know the intricate details of the moon like the mountains and the different regions, you would just think, \"Oh, any kind of -- any kind of technology you produced to grab water out of the moon is going to work universally around.\"  But it doesn't seem like that at all.  It seems like wherever you put it, you're going to need a different piece of technology because you're dealing with a different dirt, I guess.    John Gruener: That's right, yeah.  Different geologic deposits.    Host: Yeah.  So besides -- so going to the moon for just a second, talking about all of these different areas, we talk about water being one of the main things you would want to pull from the dirt.  You pulled the oxygen from the dirt and then the hydrogen, like you said, from the solar winds.  So you're getting a little bit of that.  What else could you pull from the dirt of the moon to make useful for something else?    John Gruener: So for a lot of years, people have talked about using those silicate minerals, you know, so like I said, most of the moon is silicate minerals, using the silica and those silicate minerals to make solar rays.    Host: Oh.    John Gruener: So you process the moon soil.  You make your solar rays and now, you're generating electricity with these solar rays that you made out of lunar materials, right.  So the silica could be used for that.  The iron that we were just talking about in the lava flows, of course, is the structural thing.  The titanium in those lava flows is a structural thing.  And the bright areas of the moon, the highlands, you have a lot of aluminum so again, there's a big structural thing.  There's something I'm just learning about as we're trying to find sources of simulant materials to represent the highlands of the moon.  There's something in the world called E-glass.  Steve, I don't know if you're familiar with E-glass.  But it's a structural thing.  So you know, we think of skyscrapers being made out of steel girders or we see aluminum panels on the side of barns and such.  E-glass made out of the highland materials of the moon may be a structural component someday.  So structural things like that, volatile things like the water and the oxygen.   And one thing we haven't talked about and one thing I spent a lot of my life in the 1990s doing was growing plants in simulants of planetary soil.  Because if we're ever going to have people there, we got to feed them, right?    Host: Oh, yes.    Steve Hoffman: That's the beauty of robots.  You don't have to feed them.  You don't have to water them.  You don't have to bring them home to their families.  But we do all of those things where there are the astronauts, right?    Host: Right.    Steve Hoffman: And so --    Steve Hoffman: But one of the things that the moon is deficient at is carbon.  And carbon is going to become an important constituent if we're going to go down that path.  So I mean, that -- there's an example of something where we're going to have to import a critically needed material to be able to pull off some of these kind of debt -- the crop growth, the animal growth, the feeding the human beings that are there kind of situation.    Host: At least, for a moon mission though.  On the Mars, I think you'll have more carbon.    Steve Hoffman: On Mars, we'll probably have all the constituents we need.  Although John can -- John the moon farmer and Mars farmer can tell you that that we can't just -- you can't just take a shovelful of dirt and put it in a bucket and grow things like was done on the [Inaudible].  You do have to remediate that soil.  You do have to take out some other things.    John Gruener: Take out the bad stuff.    Steve Hoffman: The bad stuff before you put your plants in it.  The best stuff that could either harm the plants or harm you, if you eat it because the plants take it up and then you consume it.  So ISRU is not a universal catchall.  There isn't everything everywhere that we need it.  There are still some things that we are going to have to bring with us to make supporting human beings for long periods of time and so plants make that possible.    John Gruener: Yeah, so in the geology world and in the Astromaterials Division where I work, when we were growing the plants, we were trying to come up with a substrate that would incorporate either the soil on the moon or Mars.  And so we had to work with the plant people, right.  So find plants that can grow in the types of soils and maybe do better with some nutrients.  So I had to learn all about biology, you know.  So my first degree was Aerospace Engineering because I thought, \"Oh, well I want to work in NASA.  Well, I better be an aerospace engineer.\"  That sounds very NASA, right?    Host: Right.    John Gruener: But after about six years or so and working with Steve way back in the late '80s and early '90s, part of my job was to go talk to the scientists and find out what they want to do on the moon so we can provide those systems for them, right?  And as I started talking more and more to the planetary scientists, I thought, \"Wow this is really cool stuff.\"    Host: Oh, yeah.    John Gruener: And so I went to night school to get my Planetary Science degree.  But it was all geology and so now I had to learn biology all of a sudden because now I'm working with the plant people and growing stuff in the soil on the moon or Mars.  And so, then I had to learn about, you know, so I learned chemistry.  We all learned chemistry, right?  But the 17 plant essential nutrients, do you happen to know what those are?    Host: Oh no.  I couldn't list them for you.    John Gruener: It turns out plants only need like 17 different chemical elements and they'll do pretty well, right.    Host: All right.    John Gruener: And we had those broken down between macronutrients and micronutrients.  And Steve mentioned carbon so that's one of the macronutrients.  So hydrogen, oxygen, carbon.  You know, those things we don't worry about in our fertilizers here in our soil because it's in the air and the water, right?  Hydrogen and oxygen, that's our water.  And then we all learned about photosynthesis and how plants take in CO2, right?  So as long as you have CO2 on Mars or you have astronauts on the moon exhaling CO2, we're going to get the carbon we need from the astronauts, right, through that CO2.    Host: Nice.    John Gruener: So just by the fact of having people on the moon or Mars, we're going to get our hydrogen, oxygen and carbon through the air and the water.  Now, the other things is where the soils come in, right.  So if you ever looked at a bag of fertilizer, there's three big numbers like 15-5-10 or 13-13-13.  Those are nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, right.  We know those things are on Mars.  There's the problem with the nitrogen on the moon.  But again, we have those astronauts there.  And when we go to the bathroom, there's lots of nitrogen in what we put out of our bodies, right?    Host: All right.    John Gruener: Our water systems in our regenerative life support world will take some of that dirty water, what we would, you know, consider dirty water.  We couldn't drink the stuff because it's full of ammonium.  Well, ammonium, NH4 -- great, there's nitrogen.  So again, if astronauts are there and they're doing their usual human things, they're going to supply us nitrogen through the waste products, right?  And so now, we have the nitrogen from the humans.  The phosphorus, potassium -- they're on the planets.  The other macronutrients, calcium, magnesium, sulfur are on the planets.  And then you get into the micronutrients, the irons, the zincs, the coppers, the molybdenums, the borons.  All those things we have measured both on the moon and Mars.  So are all those chemical elements, those plant essential nutrients that we need, are on the moon.  They're on Mars.  But not everywhere.  So you want to go to your best places.  So on Mars, I don't know if you've ever seen pictures from Curiosity or some of those but there's these very dark-looking sand dune looking things, right.   And those are basically basaltic sands that have weathered out of basaltic rocks.  And the reason they're dark is they have not had many of their chemical elements leached out of them.  So we have that problem on Mars going for us, that we have acidic leaching of some of the chemical elements, right.  But those dark basaltic sands, what a great substrate for growing plants, you know.  The moon, we can get by.  We have what we need on the moon.  But probably not as good as Mars.  So you know, this whole idea of simulants and using the soils for plants, for our resource utilization, it's really, really a big picture, you know, [inaudible] in your mind.  Sometimes, it makes your head explode.  And there are so many different disciplines and you know, and technologies working in this area both on the science side and on the engineering side.    Host: Yeah, because I think one of the more interesting parts of when you're starting to describe these things is it's not as universal as you would probably assume.  If you're talking about Mars dirt, Mars is a planet.  Planets are big.  So there's different things happening in different areas.  Maybe in the polar regions of the moon, you have more water.  In the darker regions, there's a different makeup than maybe in some of the lighter regions.  So it's a more diverse way of approaching when you're thinking about another planet and it's interesting because you're going to have to have the technology to have things work whenever you get there.    John Gruener: I'm sure.  I mean, very much like here on Earth.  My wife's from Wisconsin.  Her family's a dairy farming family.  They have beautiful soil up there.  You live here in the Houston area where we got this heavy gumbo clay.  And if you're a home gardener, you got to fight this gumbo all the time.    Host: Oh, yeah.    John Gruener: So it's this really where you are on the planet, that's where, you know, drive the benefits from the local resources.    Steve Hoffman: And that's one of the benefits of these robots that we've been talking about was Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter or Curiosity or other robots that are on Mars.  They're doing part of this prospecting job for us right now.  They're doing the very basics of telling us what it is.  If we just saw this dark sand dune in the picture, we wouldn't know if that was basalt or if it was something else.  Now we know what it is and we know, we can kind of break down the chemicals that are in it.  And these robots are also telling us that over here, you got a real high concentration of what looks like a high -- we'll pick one of these chemicals.  You're going to find a concentration of it somewhere on one part of the planet but not in the other parts.  And these robots are helping us make those maps to tell us that it's -- there's a real valuable resource over here.  But if you go over somewhere else, not so much anymore.  So you want to, you can kind of pick your -- you can start to look at those maps and decide where it's more beneficial for you to try and set up one of these bases than not.    John Gruener: Just like the realtors tell you here on Earth.  Location, location, location [laughter].    Host: So I kind of wanted to bounce off of that to sort of wrap up this talk is at the theme here is robots are pretty easy.  You don't really have to worry about that but we're going to have to think about a lot of different ways to support human exploration of the moon and Mars.  And ISRU is just one component of the many things.    John Gruener: It's a huge component.    Host: One huge component of making this work.  And so, I kind of wanted to end with why -- why explore?  Why do we send humans to do this?  And why are we putting the effort into ISRU in the first place to make it a possibility and to put human boots on the moon and Mars?    John Gruener: Well, you know, we get that question a lot.  And Steve's jumping at the microphone so I'm going to let him go first.    Steve Hoffman: I was hoping you would [laughter].  Well, the -- the robots that we're sending to these other planets are extensions of ourselves.  People have this internal need or drive to understand what's going on around them, what's over the next hill, what can -- can I go and live there?  You know, a lot of us are in the United States because you go far enough back in our ancestry that somebody came from a different part of this world and settled here.  They didn't have to.  They could have remained exactly where they were.  But they moved.  That same kind of drive is going on now.  And eventually, that will extend to other planets.  So the difference, a big difference between that example of coming from another part of the Earth to the United States is that these other planets are not like the United States or any place else on Earth for that matter.   You can't just grow there and chop down a few trees or go there, chop a few trees, plant a garden and expect to live there.  You have -- there's going to be more work, considerably more work involved in being able to stay there for the rest of your life, if that's what you choose to do.  So we're making progress along those lines.  ISRU is going to be a big part of that.  You know, there's a permanent presence at the South Pole.  But no one's growing -- there aren't acres and acres of cornfields or cattle grazing or --    John Gruener: He's talking about McMurdo Station at our South Pole [laughter].    Steve Hoffman: Our South Pole, I'm sorry.  Actually, I'm talking about the geographic South Pole.  There's a huge station there with a permanent presence but everything has to be brought there.  Literally, everything has to be brought there.  So that's not some place where you're going to see a real estate agent setting up shop to sell you, you know, the four-bedroom family house or something along those lines.    John Gruener: Well, there is that UN Treaty that kind of gets in the way of the real estate agent.    Steve Hoffman: Okay, but my point is that humans know how to live and work in a lot of different places, a lot of hostile environments.  So if we're going to be there permanently, we're making progress along those lines.  Robots are helping us do that now.  There's going to be -- to get back to your original question, I think there's going to be no end of the desire or the drive by somebody or somebodies on Earth to go live on these other planets and live there permanently.  We've had no end of volunteers that says, \"You know, send me.  I'll go on a one-way trip.\"  So that drive is going to be there and what we're doing now is working on understanding what that environment's like so we can tell people what technologies they're going to need to be able to live and work and to enjoy themselves when they get there.  And you know, eventually spend the rest of their lives there.    John Gruener: And so, you know, why we explore it?  That's a very hard question to answer.  And a lot of times, it's the kindergarteners that ask that kind of question because it's a huge question and it sounds so simple.  And I don't have a real simple answer to that, right.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: But there is no simple answer to that so the past two days, I was at NASA's Glenn Research Center working on a little project.  That's why we had to delay this little talk.  And flying home, there was this woman with her little 18-month-old girl, right.  And I was sitting next to the window but boy, that little girl wanted to look out the window.  She just [inaudible], you know.  She couldn't say any words but you could just look at her eyes and look at her face and she was amazed at what she was seeing.  And that's just this innate quality in humans, right.  We're curious about stuff.  We want to know about things.  We want to see new things.  We want to experience new things.  And that's what, you know, a part of what exploration is about, learning new things, experiencing new things.    Host: Okay.    John Gruener: But then that practical side that we were talking a little bit, you know, earlier about maybe, you know, platinum metals in space or helium-3 or whatever resources out there that we might be able to use here on the Earth.  You know, that drive to try to make life better here on Earth, to supplement what we have here on Earth, so you know, we can keep going is critical, I think, to our species because you know, this is a great planet we're living on but sooner or later, we will run of our resources.  You know, as population gets bigger and bigger.  So what are those resources out in space and how can they help us live?  And maybe you do have to go live on the moon to utilize those resources or to Mars or you know, like on the TV shows, out at the asteroid belt.  Who knows?  But you know, that's hundreds of years from now but we have to start somewhere.  And that's kind of where we are right now.  We're kind of have to start in all of that, you know.   It probably would have been fun to go back in your way-back machine and land in the 13 colonies of the United States and you're at the start of a country.  And way back then, they had no idea what we would eventually evolve to, right?  And so, when it comes to space and space resources and people getting out there and living and working for long periods of time, we're at the very beginning.  And it's really hard to say where it's all going to go but we know resource utilization is going to be a big part of it.    Host: Exactly.  You don't, you can't really predict the future but you know that something good's going to come out of it.  And so you just sort of truck on.  And that's why you cross the Atlantic and start colonizing and then you realize that, oh, maybe the, you know, there's more to this than just the coast.  And so you expand west.  You know, there's this -- you just do it and eventually good things kind of come from it.  Kind of bouncing off your first point, I think one of the biggest things you said was experience.  And that I think though, you know, we can send robots.  Robots give us a lot of data about what we sent them there to do but in terms of experience, that's a very human thing.  And I think that's something that is really important whenever you're actually going out and to other planets and to the moon.  You know, like we sent stuff to the moon before humans landed there but it was not until humans landed there that really people latched on and were inspired.  I mean, I know a lot of people here were inspired to work here specifically because of in terms of that.    John Gruener: That's why Steve and I are here.    Host: Yeah, yeah.  It's that --    John Gruener: I'm guessing you weren't even born during Apollo [laughter].    Host: No, that was a little -- that was a little bit long, a little bit ago.  But yeah, so it just -- it still inspires me though.  I mean, I wasn't alive but it's something that really drove me to work here and to put my life's work into it.    John Gruener: Yeah, one of the things we just, you know, throw around cliches always.  But you know, you've never seen a ticker tape parade for a robot, right?  The Apollo astronauts got huge ticker tape parades.  They just had a big royal wedding over in England and of course, that was a huge parade, right?    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: You don't see that for robots.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: But they're great tools for us but they're not humans.    Host: Exactly.  Well, John and Steve, thank you so much for coming on and talking a little bit about in-situ resource utilization for us today.    John Gruener: Sure, my pleasure.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, episode 116, “Apollo versus Artemis.” I'm Gary Jordan; I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts; scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know the coolest information about what's going on in human space flight. We are returning to the Moon, putting the boots of the first woman, and the next man, on its surface within five years. It's part of NASA's Artemis Program and there's a lot to it. Now one of the main questions you may be thinking right out of the gate is, how is this different from when we last went to the Moon? Fifty years ago we were in the height of the famous Apollo Program, the same program that put the boots of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the surface of the Moon, and redefined what was possible for all of humanity. One of the driving forces behind this initiative was simple, it could be condensed into a single phrase, beat the Russians. We were in the middle of a Cold War with the Soviet Union, not to mention the hot war in Vietnam, and though there were many interested in the value of exploration and discovery, the driving force was really political in nature. And that driving force defined the parameters of the Apollo mission's structure. We had to put a man on the Moon and return him safely to Earth by the end of the decade, those were the driving political forces that put speed at the forefront. This meant that the spot that you would land would be quote, the easiest, the trip would be short so you didn't have to bring a lot with you, and that you didn't have to focus too hard on the longevity of the program. I'm not knocking Apollo, because with this profile, we redefined what was possible for human history. But now, even though we're returning to the Moon, it's in a totally different way. Not to give too many spoilers for this episode, but in the Artemis Program, everything changes; the spots to land will be numerous, and the mission architecture includes flexibility with how to reach these more interesting locations, the trips will be long, so we can gather a lot of scientific data about the Moon, and about living and working on another world, and the focus will be on sustainability, so the way that the program and its systems are built are meant to continue for years and gather valuable science. So here, to go into the weeds, or I guess into the lunar regolith, man I need to get out more, here to tell us all about the differences between Apollo and Artemis, is Nujoud Merancy. Long-time listeners may recognize her name from way back in episode 17, where she gave an overview of Orion, which is the crew capsule of Artemis. Today she comes to us as the Exploration Mission Planning Office Chief, and she wrote an abstract about the differences between these two programs for the Human Space Flight Symposium that goes deep into mission architectures for both. So here we go, mission architectures of Apollo versus Artemis, with Nujoud Merancy, enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Nujoud, thank you for coming back on the podcast, welcome.  Nujoud Merancy: Thanks, Gary, glad to be here.  Host: You're in a different role now, right? Because when we last talked was episode 17, about Orion.  Nujoud Merancy: Yeah, it's been a while. And that time I was on the Orion Program Office doing mission planning but now I've moved over into a different office, but I'm leaving the office for Exploration Mission Planning, so a lot of the same stuff, but you know, worrying about a lot more of the things going on.  Host: Exploration Mission Planning, so it's basically figuring out how the design of the mission is from start to finish.  Nujoud Merancy: Right, it's the design of the mission from start to finish, including the ground systems, the Space Launch System rocket, Orion, the Gateway, the lander, all of those pieces have to play together, so we have to make the mission work from end to end, across all of the vehicles that will be executing it.  Host: And that mission is going to be Artemis, right? That's the one you're focusing on now. We are sending humans to the Moon.  Nujoud Merancy: Yes, Artemis is the new buzz word on the street.  Host: That's right.  Nujoud Merancy: But it is a landing, the first woman and the next man, on the surface of the Moon, using the vehicles we have.  Host: Now we have a little bit of history here, with going to the Moon, with a little program called Apollo.  Nujoud Merancy: Just a little program.  Host: Just a little, yeah, and naturally I think it would be smart to compare the two, right? How did Apollo work, and how is Artemis going to work?  Nujoud Merancy: Well and not just for us, but a lot of people on the street are saying, well why is it different than Apollo? So I think that's what we're here to talk about, because we're getting those questions a lot.  Host: Right, and you spent the time putting down notes on comparing the two, right? You actually drafted this paper that explores how, what the design of Apollo, the mission design, the mission architecture of Apollo was, and then what we have to do for Artemis to make that successful.  Nujoud Merancy: Right, so the mission design, you could say well we could do it exactly the same way, but that's to a different purpose and so I wrote a paper, it's going to the International Astronautical Congress in a few weeks, but that's, it's a congress, a big conference with all of the space programs, people come and talk about all sorts of things, but I thought that'd be a good venue that we could actually have this discussion a little bit more.  Host: Perfect. Well let's dive right into it.  Nujoud Merancy: Alright.  Host: Starting with Apollo, because I feel like a lot of people are more familiar with Apollo, just, I mean besides just Neil and Buzz going on the Moon, you know, one small step for man, I mean the whole idea of going to the Moon, it was a different framework and I think a lot of that was because the drive was so, you know, you had to do it by the end of the decade, right? There was a timestamp on it. And there was that drive to do it quickly, there was that drive to do it efficiently, and those were sort of the main drivers behind the Apollo Program.  Nujoud Merancy: And the drivers to do it quickly were, you know, we look back with rose colored glasses, but it wasn't about exploration for the sake of exploring, we were in a space race with the Soviet Union at the time, so there was a drive to do it very quickly, really from a militaristic background, so do it quickly and along the way, you're inventing a lot of technology. So they weren't, no one, there weren't big communication satellites, we hadn't launched tons of rockets, we'd barely put anyone in space, and yet we were trying to go to the Moon, so you don't try to do super ambitious programs, you try to do what is the quickest way to get there. And that's really the defining future of the Apollo mission design.  Host: Right, it was, I mean if you're going to do it in that span of time, one of the things I liked about your paper was you have this phrase, “minimizing performance demands”. I like that phrase because you're saying, you know, how could we do this efficiently, you don't have to have this sort of flexibility, it's just, we're going to design the mission to do exactly this, right?  Nujoud Merancy: Right, it was, you can land anywhere on the Moon, so if you can land anywhere, well you land at the easiest place on the Moon, and the easiest place to land on the Moon is near the equator, and that's just the physics of it, you know, when you send the trajectory from Earth, you launch from the equator, the Moon is in equatorial plane, you go for the equator of the Moon, and that's the easiest performance to land on, you need the least amount of propellant and delta velocity to get to the Moon at the equators, so that's, that was the goal.  Host: That was the goal and that's why they picked the landing site they did, because we want to save fuel, we don't want to use a lot of it, again, minimizing those performance demands. So here's where we can go into orbit with using the least amount of resources, pick the spot where it will be the easiest to land, right? The least amount of obstruction, not the most interesting place to land, but the easiest to land.  Nujoud Merancy: Yeah, and certainly on Apollo 11, they landed at the easiest place. They flew on a free return trajectory, which means you could have only landed within five degrees latitude of the equator. They picked a nice, big open flat plane, so there wouldn't be any obstructions, you know, they literally picked the easiest place to land. And once they did it, they could go a little bit more aggressive on the subsequent flights, they went up to the higher high lands about 20 degrees latitude off, so they could push it a little more once you were on the subsequent ones but overall, it was still the general easiest target on the Moon.  Host: Yeah, and then you armed the lunar module with some of the best pilots you can find, because Neil Armstrong, famously, as soon as he tilted down and actually saw the lunar surface, was like, we're not going to land in that--  Nujoud Merancy: There's a whole bunch of rocks in the way!  Host: Yeah, so that's why you put a nice pilot on there because we want to eventually get to that easy landing spot, because the technology was, again, minimal, you just, it was just enough technology to do it safely and to get back, but you know, you have to be ready for anything  that could come your way because you're right, you don't have the nice infrastructure of travel in space like you do, I don't know how it is today exactly, but, especially in Low Earth orbit, but going out, I mean like you said, you have to design everything from the ground up.  Nujoud Merancy: It really was from the ground up. They had to build the VAB, the big vehicle assembly building, they had to build launchers, they had to build, they had put ships in the ocean with communication radars on it and so you could actually communicate. There wasn't ground infrastructure for the comm like we have today. Now, we take it sort of for granted because we have a whole deep space network that talks to the rovers on Mars and this and that. But they were starting from scratch.  Host: Mm hmm.  Nujoud Merancy: So you literally, they had Navy ships sitting out in the ocean to cover the communication from the Moon. So there's all those things they were doing from scratch, so you couldn't spend a lot of resources on fancy things.  Host: Right.  Nujoud Merancy: So you went for the best way, the cheapest way to get it done if you will.  Host: So, coming from the ground, having to build this literally from scratch, they had this part in the Apollo Program called the Reference Missions. What was that?  Nujoud Merancy: So a reference mission is what you always sort of you start with and say, this is my plan and now I'm going to build the pieces to do it. So a design reference mission is your baseline mission plan and then you execute, you have to decompose that into well, I need a rocket that's going to have this performance, I need a spacecraft with this performance, you know, the capsule will have to do this. And then you can trade between them as the design goes, but you're trading against that design reference mission. So the design reference mission for Apollo was that equatorial landing site, with the free return trajectory, it was putting two people on the Moon, and doing it for, you know, just if you literally Apollo 11 was only on the surface of the Moon for a few hours. It was measured in hours. And then subsequent flights that could go a few days, but you weren't trying to do long duration, multi-month missions to the Moon. It was get to the Moon, pick up some rocks, and come home again.  Host: That's it, so, the free return trajectory, correct me if I'm wrong, was one of several trajectories that they were considering when they were trying to come up with a reference for what is the easiest and what is the rocket that we need, or rockets that we need, depending on the profile of how we're actually going to make this happen.  Nujoud Merancy: Yeah, and the free return is really a safety thing, because if you're on a free return trajectory, and say you had a problem with your service module main engine, you would fly by the Moon and the Moon would slingshot you back to Earth. It's the Apollo 13 scenario. And so it uses the Moon's gravity to send you back to Earth and you don't need a big burn out of your engine to get home again. So the first couple flights to the Moon, that's what they used, they stayed on that free return because we were still demonstrating that all the systems worked. And then actually starting on Apollo 13, they stopped using the free return because they, you can't use it to go to those higher latitudes on the Moon, so once they had a problem on Apollo 13, they had to do a burn to get back to the free return so that they could get home before they ran out of power in their capsule. So there was a whole bunch of situations going on, so, but yeah a free return was the design reference mission being used initially.  Host: Wow, now there was another one and I might be confusing this, so just, so just steer me to the right course as I'm saying this, but, the lunar orbit rendezvous was one of many that they were considering because I think there was an Earth orbit rendezvous, there was a, there were all these different profiles when they were thinking, you know, how can we actually, how can we actually get to the Moon. So, how did that work? And how, why did they select lunar orbit rendezvous?  Nujoud Merancy: Yes, so that's its own fun story, right? So, there was, there's essentially three ways; you could go direct, where you have one giant rocket, leaves Earth, lands on the Moon, takes off again and comes home again. So just one piece. So but in order to do that, you need a really big rocket because you need all that fuel to control your landing, and then that structure where, that held all that fuel, you're going to take off again with it so you end up with a really big rocket, just to do the math of getting there. And then there's something called the Earth orbit rendezvous, where you'd launch two rockets from Earth, meet up in Earth orbit and then go to the Moon, but then you'd still land one rocket on the Moon and come back. Or there was lunar orbit rendezvous, which is ultimately what was selected and that was actually John Houbolt went above his managers head to recommend it back to headquarters so it was its own thing that he actually had been turned down from talking about lunar orbit rendezvous again, wrote the technical paper, management ended up agreeing and implementing it, but it was very controversial at the time because we'd never rendezvoused two spacecraft in Earth orbit, but yet here we were talking about landing a spacecraft on the Moon, leaving the command module in lunar orbit, and then having the asset module leave the Moon, rendezvous and dock with that command module in lunar orbit, and then come home again. So you had multiple pieces, you have essentially broke your vehicle up into three pieces in order to pull this off, but what that does is let each element be a lot smaller and that's where you get all your savings and you can make your rocket on Earth smaller because you launched smaller pieces from the Moon. So it's all a game of math and the bigger you have to land on the Moon, the bigger the rocket you need on Earth and ultimately that enormous Earth rocket, as big as Saturn 5 is, trying to launch a direct size vehicle would have been just astronomical.  Host: Yeah, you know, that lunar orbit rendezvous sounded complicated but then when you actually sit down and think logically about it you're like, huh, this is probably the smartest way to do it.  Nujoud Merancy: Right, it's a very elegant solution, you just have to do more things in lunar orbit, which initially wasn't a favorable thing because we'd barely done anything in Earth orbit.  Host: It was risky.  Nujoud Merancy: It was risky, so you had to accept a little bit more risk on the backend but it made your vehicle sizes feasible in the end.  Host: So, now let's get into the nitty gritty of how this actually worked. We selected the lunar orbit rendezvous, we're doing an Apollo mission, we need the Saturn 5, the Saturn 5 is going to carry all of those elements that you just described, starting there to carry x amount of mass to this orbit of the Moon.  Nujoud Merancy: Right, so the big Saturn 5 rocket, the whole purpose, three stages of it, were to launch the three pieces you needed at the Moon. So this whole thing was a direct launch though, because you used one launch to launch your command module, your service module, and your lunar module, which included both an ascent and descent element. So you used one launch to go directly to the Moon, land on the Moon, and come home again. So it was a very performance optimal, right, minimum performance option of how do I get someone on the Moon. So, and putting it all on one rocket at one time, is the best answer for that.  Host: There you go. So, you put it all on the rocket, you get into Low Earth orbit, now you're in your circling the Moon, you have a third stage because the rocket is so big--  Nujoud Merancy: You're circling the Earth.  Host: What did I say, did I say the Moon?  Nujoud Merancy: You said the Moon.  Host: Ah man, I'm already at the Moon. Circling the Earth, there we are, now we have this third stage that is going to perform something that's very critical when it comes to lunar exploration, called trans- lunar injection, and that is going to carry all of those elements that you just described in one big burn to get to the Moon, right?  Nujoud Merancy: Right.  Host: OK, so that was a huge part of it.  Nujoud Merancy: Right, so the third stage sends your three pieces to the Moon, and then the service module on Apollo actually inserted into lunar orbit, and we used 100 kilometer, or 60 nautical mile orbit, so you're pretty close to the Moon when you're circling it, and then the lunar module undocked with two people on board and they do a controlled power descent, so that's really the flamy end of the rocket first towards the Moon, you set it down nice and gently, and then you leave the descent stage, after you've done all of the things you're going to do on the surface, so now you leave some of that mass behind, and that's the whole point of having two pieces there, is now you're a much smaller element, the ascent module took back off with the people to come back, rendezvous with Apollo in lunar orbit, and then Apollo would perform the trans Earth injection which is the burn you need to return safely to Earth.  Host: There you go, and so, when it came to power, when you needed to actually perform that whole thing, as you just described, going to the Moon, landing, coming back, the power you needed was only for a few days, so you didn't need to have a system that was going to, you know, over perform and provide power for months and years, you had fuel cells.  Nujoud Merancy: Yes, so Apollo, because it was only going to operate for a maximum of 11-14 days, they used fuel cells, which is the same thing the shuttle used actually, where it uses a commodity onboard hydrogen and creates power through the chemical reaction of the chemicals on board and then produces energy and actually water as a bi-product. But by doing that, you can only produce power for as long as the tanks you had that you took off with. So, the reason to use fuel cells is they're pretty mass efficient, which means they're lighter, but they're only good for a couple weeks at a time before you run out of your stuff to make power with.  Host: And so another constraint was, not necessarily constraint, but when you're designing this mission, you talked about the crew module, no, yeah, command module sorry, command module was going to continue to orbit the Moon while two astronauts went down in the lunar module to land on the surface and then explore through EVA, you only needed one person in that command module, so this whole mission is designed for three people max.  Nujoud Merancy: Right. Three people max is all you could fit in the command module of Apollo, two people to the surface, one had to stay in space in the command module because this is 1960's technology, right? They barely had enough software to run the guidance computer, they didn't have fully automated iPhone apps that could command it all. So someone literally had to stay on board just to keep the Apollo vehicle running while the others were gone. So, one person stayed on board, and then because of that you know, you have a very small command module, you're trying to minimize mass, they only had enough food, water, oxygen, on board, you only make the tanks as big as you absolutely have to so they only had about 14 days' worth of supplies on board for that crew. So you can't stretch the mission, there was no way this mission could go for many months.  Host: That's another key point, is when you're designing the life support systems, they're tanks, you just take everything you need with you because you only have a finite number of days that you're going to be there. They don't have to be the life support systems like you see on the space situation now which are just constantly running, because you need to operate for 20 years continuously.  Nujoud Merancy: Right, yeah, they have tanks of water and tanks of oxygen, and when they were out, they were out. So you had to be home before you were going to run out of those, that's part of the mission planning right there.  Host: I do have a, this is something that I've always been sort of confused on but probably shouldn't be, whenever the lunar module actually went down, you had the just, like you said, the descent and the ascent modules, or parts of the lunar module, those were two separate fuel tanks, right? So the descent had a certain amount of fuel to do that job, and then the ascent had a certain amount of fuel to do its job.  Nujoud Merancy: Correct, they both had their own fuel tanks and their own engines. So one of the interesting things is that ascent module was used once during the flight, to get off the Moon, and you couldn't test it, so you better hope it worked, because once you set down on the Moon, it was actually buried inside the descent module so you couldn't test fire it before you went down or anything, you'd burn your descent module up. So literally you went to the Moon and you were going to use that engine and it had to work when you were ready for it because there was no chance to test it before you landed.  Host: See, when you say these things, it just shows me how amazing these astronauts were to actually go and do this, because there's so many unknowns about the whole mission. But yeah, even--  Nujoud Merancy: Got to trust your engineers.  Host: Got to trust your engineers, exactly. You know, you talked about computer issues, the reason that we have to have a person in orbit there, you talked about the fuel, only a very finite amount of fuel, these were all very, very key moments of the Apollo 11 mission. When they, when Neil Armstrong had to take the controls of the lunar module and descend towards the surface, he was running out of fuel and running out of fuel fast, he did not have a lot left, I think it was 18 seconds--  Nujoud Merancy: Yeah, it was in the, you know single seconds of, you know, counted on your hands  Host: And then on top of that, you had those 1202 alarms going off, which was a computer overload issue because they literally couldn't handle the amount of data that was, I mean, this was just like, almost archaic now when you think about it, but it was the way that had to be done to achieve these minimizing performance demands.  Nujoud Merancy: And that truly was state of the art, what you were doing.  Host: That is true! Computers were a new thing.  Nujoud Merancy: Right, computers were pushed along there. And also in terms of performance because you left the Apollo module in orbit, the Moon, as it's going around the Earth, means that orbit is shifting its orientation towards the Earth, so it had to keep, and it shifts its orientation around the Moon, so it has to stay above the site where the lander is. So it has to keep doing burns to adjust its orbit to stay above the lunar lander so that the lander could even get back to it. So part of the propellant and the performance is how much, how long can the command module do that. So part of the constraint on how many days you can spend on the Moon was the propellant in the command module, staying above the lunar lander so they could come home again.  Host: And it had to maintain that orbit to A, be in the same plane, but B, be predictable. Because I know the lunar module had, even after it landed, they weren't celebrating at mission control because they had several periods where if something were to go wrong, they can fire that ascent stage and re-rendezvous with the command module a little bit early, just in case. So that orbit had to be predictable.  Nujoud Merancy: Yeah, so you had to keep the command module in its very known location in a very certain way so that the ascent module could even get back to it, so part of the duration for the surface constraint is the ascent, or the command module having the prop to keep doing that. So it was only a few days' worth of prop on board for that as well before you would have to come home.  Host: So then when you did come home, they rendezvoused in orbit like you said, and then they had a trans-Earth injection to get back to Earth. Now I believe they just, they didn't, once, they didn't reenter into Earth's orbit, right? They just, they went into the atmosphere.  Nujoud Merancy: Yeah, it's called a direct entry--  Host: Direct entry.  Nujoud Merancy: So, you left, you actually jettisoned that lunar module, ascent module, around the Moon.  Host: That’s right.  Nujoud Merancy: So it crashed back into the Moon, you didn't carry that mass home with you, and then as it comes back to Earth, the command module separated from the service module, only the command module landed safely and the service module, of course, broke up on reentry and splashed into the ocean.  Host: Mm hmm, and they chose the ocean for, I guess design purposes?  Nujoud Merancy: Yeah, it's a, there's no rocks in the ocean.  Host: Yeah. [Laughter]  Nujoud Merancy: Or at least they're really far down so you're not going to hit them. So landing in the ocean gives you a nice, predictable surface, where you're not going to land on a rock and crack your command module open or hurt your crew. So they landed in the ocean, near the Pacific, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, really and a Navy ship would be stationed, waiting for them.  Host: And why the middle of the Pacific Ocean?  Nujoud Merancy: Well, it was really just to make sure your service module doesn't land on anything, number one. But also they had a, they didn't use a skip in entry like we do today. They came in direct so you needed to have room for that landing and you would move the ship to be where it is. So they landed and then, you know, they had full control over the Navy because this was National Security interest so they could, the Navy would support whatever was needed, wherever it was needed.  Host: Nice, and so that provided you a little bit more area, you didn't have to be as accurate when it came to the landing.  Nujoud Merancy: Correct. You could have a much larger zone for landing.  Host: OK, so this mission profile, the mission profile of Apollo, what was good about it, to meet the needs of the time?  Nujoud Merancy: What was good about it was by putting it all on one launch, while you limited where you could go on the surface of the Moon, it was one launch, so that way you had the least amount of resources assigned to it, the least amount of risk, even though there's a lot of risk still, you only had one launch to get it up there, but as a result, you were very limited on how long you could stay, and how much you could take, which was only three people for a limited stay of a couple days.  Host: So why won't this mission profile work for what we want to do with Artemis?  Nujoud Merancy: So one of the big differences between Apollo, which was get to the Moon as fast as you can, as quick as you can, it is for Artemis, we want to be sustainable, which means we want to be able to explore for longer durations, potentially you could build bases, but also you want to demonstrate things you need to go to Mars. And all of the things you need to go to Mars, involve much longer durations, surface stays on Mars are basically 30 days to 6 months, so you need to be able to do long duration stays and have a long-term buildup of stuff, because you need a lot more stuff, the longer you're going to stay. So it's a very different goal between Apollo and Artemis.  Host: And complicated, now when you stay longer and you need more stuff, that's all more complicated stuff.  Nujoud Merancy: Exactly.  Host: So let's go into Artemis. There are still a lot of unknowns about exactly how this is going to work, right?  Nujoud Merancy: Absolutely. So there's, I mean we don't even know who's going to provide the lander system yet. The contracts are out for bids, and things like that. So there's a lot of unknown, so this is really a discussion of the potential and not a fixed mission profile for the future.  Host: Well let's get into it. What are the key components of an Artemis mission?  Nujoud Merancy: So the key components of an Artemis mission; first you start with SLS and Orion, so we're demonstrating those in Artemis 1 and 2, so that is the first crewed vehicle beyond Low-Earth orbit since Apollo. And so that will be taking the capability to take crews to and from lunar orbits, so that's the first part. The second part then is which orbit around the Moon? So right now, we're planning for the Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit, which if you looked at the Moon, looks like an orbit that goes North - South on the Moon, rather than around the fat part, the equator if you will. And so it is really close to the Moon at the North Pole, and it's really far away from the Moon at the South Pole. So it's a very different kind of orbit than people are used to talking about.  Host: If you were looking at the Moon during the full Moon and you could, in this fake scenario, actually see this thing moving, would it be more moving North to South or South to North?  Nujoud Merancy: Well, it's both, so it's, you'd be looking at the oval, and so on one side you'd be going North, and then you'd come around the top of the Moon and head South. And you're just really close at the top of the Moon, at the North Pole, and then really far away at the South Pole and so, the whole orbit takes 6 1/2 to 7 days.  Host: Okay.  Nujoud Merancy: To make one orbit of the Moon. So you spend most of your time dwelling below the South Pole, in the bottom part of that oval that you'd be looking at.  Host: Right, because it stretches really far down that way.  Nujoud Merancy: Right.  Host: OK, OK, so now you're entering into an orbit there, and I think one of the reasons you want to do that is because there's this new thing, that's different from Apollo, called a Gateway.  Nujoud Merancy: Right, so the Gateway is basically a little mini module or station setup with a power and propulsion element and what will be the halo, which is just a small logistics and outfitting module, really think of it like a node on the space station, where you had multiple ports on it. And that's there because we need to be able to prototype Mars habitats and things like that so that's really there to start building on those other technologies you need to go beyond the Moon. So we can use the halo and the PPE as a Gateway, to dock the lander and dock Orion too, and so that's part of the notional plan for the future.  Host: OK, so what is nice about having this Gateway in orbit versus must the command module and the lunar module?  Nujoud Merancy: It gives you more options to get stuff up there. So you have suits, you need all those science equipment's, you need lots of commodities for what you're about to do, so it's launching logistics as well that you'll need for the Moon.  Host: And that's a bit part of Artemis, right? Is stuff we're bringing more stuff and we're doing it for longer.  Nujoud Merancy: Right, if you want to stay on the Moon for longer and do more science, you've got to have a lot more stuff.  Host: There you go. Now the profile that we're going to explore today assumes a three piece human lander system, right?  Nujoud Merancy: Yeah, so for now I'm using the three piece lander, you could launch those on commercial rockets, or however you want to get them up there, but you still need a lot of gas to get from NRHO down to the Moon, you need a lot of gas to get from low lunar orbit down to the surface of the Moon. So, it takes, the Delta V as in total on the mission, is about the same whether you went to low lunar orbit, it's just who's providing it is the-- in the Apollo scenario, the Apollo service module provided a bunch of Delta V, in this scenario, we're using more of that on the lander to provide the Delta V, Delta Velocity, to get to the surface of the Moon. So Orion does its part to get to NRHO, the lander does the part from NRHO to the surface.  Host: Got it. OK, because you need to, it sounded like you needed to change orbit, you needed to go from this Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit to low lunar orbit, right? And that's part of the work horse of the lander.  Nujoud Merancy: Yeah, part of the work horse of the lander is first you adjust your orbit to get it down to low lunar orbit, and that allows you to setup for where you want to land. And then you go from low lunar orbit down to the surface. So I mean, you could go very direct but it's a little bit more complicated just for the guidance of making such a huge change. So you want to pause, you're really just pausing in low lunar orbit and then you continue down to the surface.  Host: OK, so there are, if we wanted to explore these three pieces, the way you laid them out was transfer, descent, and ascent elements. So what would they all do?  Nujoud Merancy: Right, so the transfer element would be what takes you from NRHO to low lunar orbit, the doesn't element takes you from low lunar orbit to the surface of the Moon, and then the ascent element would take you from the surface all the way back to NRHO to rendezvous with Gateway.  Host: Alright, so all of these elements have to do with switching where you want to be.  Nujoud Merancy: Right.  Host: Yeah.  Nujoud Merancy: It's all the intermediate staging of getting there.  Host: OK. Now another thing that this profile assumes is the type of SLS built that you want to use, so there's several stages in the development of the space launch system, there's Block 1, and Block 1B, that you explore in this so what is the differences there?  Nujoud Merancy: Well Block 1 is the one we're launching on Artemis 1 and 2, and it's, Block 1 launches Orion to trans- lunar injection. So that sends Orion to the Moon on its own. And you can do this mission off of Block 1, so really, it's an either - or. If you get Block 1B, you could use it in the future, and what Block 1B is, it makes a bigger upper stage, called the exploration upper stage, and that would allow you to launch Orion and another co-manifest payload, like a logistics module, that Orion could carry with it to that Gateway. So, it's really the mission profile works very similar whether you're using an SLS Block 1 or a Block 1B, but it’s how much extra stuff you can take with that Block 1B. And you have more launch opportunities on Block 1B, because of the earth's staging that you're doing.  Host: OK, so, there is different types of orbits here, and this is where I just sort of kind of don't really understand, but there is 100 nautical miles circular orbit for Block 1B, and there is a very elliptical orbit that would be used for Block 1, so that was part of the differences that I saw in if you were using a different construction of the SLS, how that would vary for this lunar mission.  Nujoud Merancy: Yeah, on a Block 1, we launch into a very elliptical Earth orbit so right now it's 100 by 1450 nautical miles. And so what that means is when you go to the Moon, you have to point that high end, your 1450 nautical mile Earth staging is sort of pointed at the Moon and that's where we use the core stage to push it up as high as you could and then the ICPS, the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage, makes up the difference to get to that trans lunar injection. With the larger exploration upper stage, the, you go to just 100 nautical miles circular orbit and then you can, the Moon can be in any direction because it's circular, any one of the directions of that orbit are equally good. So that's why you can launch more often on a Block 1B to the Moon, because it doesn't matter where the Moon is, relative to the Earth orbit.  Host: Okay, now, let's build this profile and assume that the Gateway and the lander are already there in the Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit. So what is the, I guess, transit time, what is the, what is the profile for if you were to launch from Florida and perform an Artemis mission?  Nujoud Merancy: Yeah, so SLS would take off with Orion, whether, regardless of which version you're on, Orion would use a variable transit, so you can go in as fast as six days or as much as you know, 12-14, and that's also that by the time you arrive in the Near Rectilinear Halo, you arrive at the same point in the orbit that Gateway and the lander are waiting for you. Because we said that orbit was seven days long, so if you arrive and it's on the opposite side of the orbit, you're not there, you can't rendezvous and dock, so you have to arrive in orbit at the same place the Gateway is. So, and that's called rendezvous targeting.  Host: OK, so if you were, let's take a mission, let's do an Artemis mission, we can use a Block 1 or a Block 1B, whatever, but you have this trans-lunar injection with all your stuff that you're taking to the Gateway, so now you have to make sure that the timing that you actually get to that orbit, times out perfectly with where the Gateway is going to be so that, because that is stop one, stop one is the Gateway.  Nujoud Merancy: Right, stop one is Orion docking to the Gateway in that Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit, because Gateway has your lander attached to it. So Orion docks with Gateway, all of that timing is correct, and then the crew can get into the Gateway, unpack all their stuff, get the lander ready to go, and then stop two is the lander actually separating from Gateway to start heading down to the Moon.  Host: And in this scenario, we have packed Orion with four crew members.  Nujoud Merancy: Right, Orion would take all four crew members, for 2024 we want to just, we're trying to just put two people on the surface of the Moon, so two people would remain on Gateway, two people would go down in the lander to the surface.  Host: OK. So that is part of the, I guess design of Orion why we have four people or is it the needs of, we need two people in Gateway and we need two people to ride this lunar lander?  Nujoud Merancy: So, it's really because Orion can hold four people, and the long-term planning as we talk about wanting to be able to be sustainable and do long-term exploration, is that eventually you want to be able to land all four people on the Moon. But as you build up your vehicles and capabilities, that added mass, now you know more, you can land more people, things like that. So the first attempt is to land two people, but Orion can take all four with them to start the mission.  Host: So interesting, so in this, if that is the goal, then that means that the design of Gateway will be so that it does not need to have people on it all the time.  Nujoud Merancy: Right, I mean Gateway is there all the time, like the space station, except unlike space station, you need no human tenders for long durations in between visits. So the Gateway, now with our modern software and computers, all of our telecommunications infrastructure, the Gateway will be designed to be completely untended or at least only tended by flight controllers here on the ground, during long stretches without people.  Host: OK, so let's take a ride with these two astronauts that are descending towards the lunar surface and they have, let's just assume that the three elements of the lander, so they are going into the low lunar orbit and then they're going down to the surface, what is that mission profile to make sure you know, just like Apollo, where you had to time when the lunar lander and the command module were, how long can they be on the surface?  Nujoud Merancy: So that, the interesting part about this, so as we're trying to aim for the South Pole, because that's where we think the most science is, so this is a science driven mission, if we land on the South Pole, where we think there's water, ice, there's permanently shadowed regions where that ice may exist right there on the surface of the Moon, so the goal is to land on the South Pole, so you time your departure from the Gateway to insert into a low lunar orbit, but this time it's polar, so for Apollo it was an equatorial orbit, for Artemis they'll insert into a polar lunar orbit, which means it goes North - South instead of East - West, around the Moon. And then they'll descend and land right there on the South Pole, so if you're looking at the Moon, they'd be hanging off the bottom like that.  Host: So, this is another key component of Artemis, is we are no longer choosing what is the easiest landing site, we're choosing what is the most interesting.  Nujoud Merancy: Exactly, that is probably one of the primary drivers right now, we want to go for the science, we want to go for the exploration of it, so we're not picking the easiest part, we're actually picking probably the hardest part, because it's polar orbit instead of equatorial.  Host: And I guess with being, having to land in the more interesting area, you would want to spend more time there.  Nujoud Merancy: Right, and part of the spending more time there is that you're actually waiting for the timing to get back to the Gateway. So you're in that 7 day orbit, so you want to time, you want to maximize your time on the surface so you'll get 6 1/2 days on the surface, before you need to take off again to arrive at that point in NRHO where the Gateway's waiting for you again. So all of this is timed on the best timing for again, as little performance as you have to have, so you don't have unlimited fuel supply so you want to time things so you can, you know, make things ideal for your vehicles instead of making it hard. So we still have to worry about performance, even though Apollo did, but we're landing in a harder place, so now your performance is about getting to that harder place on the Moon in this case.  Host: OK, harder place on the Moon. But this is going to be sort of the, I guess we're assuming this is the kickoff of the Artemis Program, right? This is like landing number one.  Nujoud Merancy: Well, this would be the third Artemis flight, because you will have launched SLS and Orion, twice. But Artemis 3, would be the first landing on the Moon, yes.  Host: Got it, OK, but then after that, it can be like Apollo and just get more complicated over time as you need to do more on the surface.  Nujoud Merancy: Yeah, once you've done it the first time, now you can start OK, well this worked really well so I have more margin here than I thought, and I can you know, scale back on some of my needs here because we didn't use, say as much oxygen or something. So you can actually get harder on subsequent flights once you've proven your hard work out.  Host: OK. So, now you've explored the surface on, is it, will it be Artemis 3, is that? Or is it something else?  Nujoud Merancy: Well this is Artemis 3 mission.  Host: This is Artemis 3, OK, so this, on Artemis 3, you've done your lunar exploration and now you are lifting back off to the Gateway, how do you get from Gateway to Earth?  Nujoud Merancy: So you get back to Gateway, and this is actually very simple, you get back in Orion, and then at the right point in the orbit, you leave the Gateway and Orion takes you home again, doing the trans Earth injection burn.  Host: OK. In the Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit, just kind of separate and do your own they?  Nujoud Merancy: There's kind of two burns; first you separate and you do a departure burn from that orbit, and you actually fly back by the Moon at 100 kilometers, or 60 nautical miles, and then you do a burn as you fly by the Moon to target Earth again. So it's two burns, one to leave the orbit, one to fly by the Moon and target Earth, but that all is 5 days from the time you leave Gateway until you're back at Earth.  Host: OK. And this, it's sort of the same profile on the way back, you're flying back with Orion, on the way back Orion separates from service module and then kind of like Apollo, you go right into the atmosphere or now we're doing something different?  Nujoud Merancy: You directly enter the atmosphere again, so we come right back in, except this time we're using a skip entry, so we land just off the coast of San Diego, so sunny San Diego, is awaiting the crew, and we do that because we actually use the atmosphere to skip through the atmosphere and guide the vehicle so it's, it's really flying itself with the lifting body while to target that, so you're targeting a 10 kilometer circle essentially in the middle of the ocean, not the middle, the San Diego coastline.  Host: Yeah, so it's more accurate.  Nujoud Merancy: It is very accurate landing and then, and actually most of that 10 kilometers is the wind pushing the parachutes around.  Host: Oh wow.  Nujoud Merancy: If you weren't under parachutes, you'd land in even much more tight area.  Host: Oh, wow.  Nujoud Merancy: But we kind of need the parachutes.  Host: Yeah. Alright, so there you have it, there's an Artemis mission from start to finish. There are certain, I guess, constraints and different ways that we have to think about the Artemis because as we've alluded to, sort of in the beginning of our talk, space has changed. Now we have different ways to communicate with things that are going out to the Moon, we have more, better technologies, so let's kind of go into some of those, some of those constraints based on what Apollo kind of had to encounter and deal with their technology, and what we're dealing with. And I guess we can start with communications.  Nujoud Merancy: So communications is a really fun one. So during Apollo, there weren't communication satellites in orbit, there weren't TDRSS, which is you know, the data relay satellites that shuttle and station use. You know, you were using ground antennas, there wasn't a deep space network at the time, so one of the big constraints on Apollo was, you had to land on the face of the Moon, facing Earth and you had to land no more than about 20 degrees north or south latitude, so you'd have the right communication with Earth direct line of sight during landing, the approach to landing, and the time on the surface. So once you just cut out the comm, you've cut out about 80% of the Moon, to have available landing sites during Apollo.  Host: OK, now what are we looking at with Artemis?  Nujoud Merancy: So with Artemis, you get two things; first, we have the Deep Space Network, so you can land really anywhere on that front face, but one of the advantages of that Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit that Gateway in, is Gateway can act as a comm relay, so the whole time it's below the South Pole, the lander can talk to Gateway and Gateway can talk to Earth. So now you can land on that South Pole, almost all of the time, because Gateway could act as a relay, so you sometimes you have direct line of sight from that South Pole to the Deep Space Network, sometimes you can go through Gateway, but really, now with modern technology, the communications isn't really an obstacle. And if you really needed to, you could put a, just a little communication relay satellite out there with Gateway and you could have full coverage of the Moon all the time.  Host: Alright, so more options, that's what we're looking at.  Nujoud Merancy: Lots more options now.  Host: Which is big for exploration and science, now we can go towards those really interesting areas, find out what's on the surface and areas that we couldn't cover before because we have the technology now.  Nujoud Merancy: Right, and now we have that technology so you can land, just like they do on Mars, you can put rovers on there, which is what some of the commercial lunar payload service contracts are to put some un-crewed rovers on there to do science even before we can send humans. So there's lots of options now with modern technology you didn't have in Apollo.  Host: OK, and even the trajectory has changed before with the constraints with the trans- lunar injection. Apollo, I believe was very constrained on what they can do and then with the SLS, I think there's maybe a little bit more flexibility and you already alluded to it, doesn't matter where the Moon is.  Nujoud Merancy: Right, so when Apollo, the Saturn 5 launched, there's no tracking stations out there in the middle of the ocean and they didn't have relay satellites in orbit, so they actually literally put a ship off the coast of Florida and you only had about 26 degrees azimuth so that's you know, the North - South launch angle that it took off from Florida at, so it had a very narrow window to launch into, now we have tracking stations in Bermuda and at KSC, as well as TDRSS [Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System] in space so there's a much larger swath of ocean you can launch over with the added communication just on the ground as well.  Host: Wow, OK, yeah. There's, it's more technology, more flexibility, more options, this is all awesome. Now, I think a big distinction between Artemis and Apollo, it may sound small but it actually is significant, is the number of crew. With three people and with four people, it doesn't sound like much, but with more people comes more mass, more stuff you need, right? So there's differences there.  Nujoud Merancy: Yeah, so Apollo, with three people on board, and that's like all they could fit in that capsule, Orion is a little bit bigger, it's about a meter wider, and what you can do with that, when you say you're going to put an extra person on you're like well how much can they weigh? You know, 200 pounds, right? Pretty much average. But, with that 200 pound person, they need a seat, they need more oxygen, you need more water, they need food and clothes because everyone else gets food and clothes, so that ends up being over 1000 pounds extra per person you put on there, and the space you need for them. So you need a bigger capsule volume because, just literally because you put a fourth person in there with everyone else. So Orion is bigger, it was the design to be bigger to carry those four people, and there was I'm sure a lot of trades long ago about why we're going to do four people, but I don't know those right now. [Laughter]  Host: Now what about the, when it comes to if you were to look at the Apollo command module and the Orion, and then the service modules of each. Now what are we looking at in terms of design, in terms of size, in terms of technology differences between these vehicles?  Nujoud Merancy: So Apollo had, what we say with those three people, a very small command module and a really big service module, because they were getting all of those lunar orbit insertion and departure burns from the service module. Orion has a bigger crew module, so they call it command module, we call it crew module, there's the big difference, so our crew module is much bigger than Apollo, but we have a little bit smaller of a service module and we were sized a little bit different a long time ago, so we have less Delta V capability in Orion, but we're also carrying more people. So the bigger mass you have, the you know, how much mass you have F equals MA, more fuel you need just to push that around. So a lot of the fuel is going to pushing around that bigger crew module on Orion. And then one of the other big differences, we talked about the fuel cells earlier, Orion has solar arrays and the real reason for that is because then you can do long duration missions because you get free power from the sun for as long as you want to be there. So Orion doesn't have, you know, Apollo had a 14 day limit on the vehicle with the fuel cells, but Orion, for power, can fly unlimited.  Host: OK. There's also differences between what we just described in the Apollo mission going right to low lunar orbit, versus Artemis going to this Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit, what are the constraints for each of those?  Nujoud Merancy: So, it's really about that timing with the arrival at Gateway and it's how much Delta Velocity you can produce with your service module. So Orion is going to NRHO and can take a logistics module and meet up with Gateway, it's really a sweet spot up in orbit because you don't need any gas to stay there. Or at least you need very little. So as you were talking earlier, you have to maintain your precision orbit and know where you are, but when you're in Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit, sort of the Moon and the Earth's gravity do it for you. So you just store or stay in this nice happy place. So there's a reason if you put the Gateway there, now the Gateway doesn't have to carry a lot of prop just to stay in orbit. So you have this orbit that's good for hundreds of years, with very little prop to stay there, so that's a, it's a really nice balance point between the Earth and the Moon.  Host: Because the mission profile of Artemis is to be there longer whereas Apollo was just, and you're even describing it in just launching and all these different communications constraints, they just had, they had to work with what they had, technology wise, and communications wise, this is just like we can narrow it down to where we want to land to like this spot, and you said that you had to cancel out like 80% of the Moon whenever you're considering where to land with Apollo.  Nujoud Merancy: Yeah, and so Apollo, since they used that low lunar orbit, they have to keep using gas to counteract the procession of the orbit, so you can keep aligned with the lander and with Earth to come home again, so you can't do that indefinitely or you'd need an enormous amount of fuel to do that, so if you want to do longer missions, you need to be able to get back to your staging orbit continuously without spending tons of prop. And so that's the real advantage of a Near Rectilinear Halo, is you have that long duration orbit that doesn't need fuel to keep moving it around the Moon.  Host: Now with Apollo, you know, we talked about the very limited selection of landing zones that they could choose, but even then there was constraints with landing zones. I know just the performance of the command module, the terrain of what you actually had to do because you had to look for that nice flat spot with limited obstruction, but even lighting was a big concern.  Nujoud Merancy: Yeah, one of the most fascinating things about Apollo, I mean they're using the technology they had during the day, but you had to do manual piloting to land, which means the crew had to look at the surface, they had some guidance to point them, but the crew was doing terrain awareness, the hazard avoidance, they literally were using a joystick to fly it down and when, to do that, now you need to be able to see the obstructions and things like that, and because the Moon is all very gray, with a highly reflective surface, if you come in with the sun overhead, it washes out a lot of the features. So you had to land, they only had a landing zone with the light had to be within 13 and 26 degrees, the sun had to be 13 to 26 degrees off the surface of the Moon in order for the crew to be able to see all of the rocks and craters to avoid. So with that, each landing site on the Moon is only available one day a month.  Host: Oh my God.  Nujoud Merancy: So the sun, the Moon keeps turning, it goes around the sun, right? And so each landing site on the Moon, the sun is only on the right place one day a month, so if you wanted to go to a specific place on the equator, you could only launch once a month to get to it.  Host: Wow.  Nujoud Merancy: And so, for Apollo, they could launch a couple times a month, but they were literally, if they had missed one launch, they'd go land at a completely different place on the Moon. So if you were going to try to build a base, it's not a very useful operation to build up something because you can only get there once a month or you have to pick a different place. And if you're building a base, you need to go back to the same place over and over again.  Host: Wow. So what changes with Artemis, how are we able to I guess have the flexibility and not be constrained by lighting?  Nujoud Merancy: So this is where advanced technology again comes into play. So for landing on Artemis, now we have flash LIDAR's, we have lots of sensor technology, optical cameras with software behind them, so you can use LIDAR's and cameras to do that terrain and hazard avoidance. So now the crew's eyes can be there for safety, but you're really going to rely on that technology because when you're on the South Pole of the Moon, the sun is only about zero to 10 degrees off the surface of the Moon. So it's like just coming right over the edge of the horizon, and if you've got a tall mountain in the way, you can actually be shadowed by a mountain in the distance. So, all on that South Pole, you've got to, you can't rely on the sun and the crew's eyes so well, because they may not be able to tell what all the hazards are.  Host: Now, the landing itself, I mean if we're talking technology, all of these different cameras that can actually help you with that lighting, I'm assuming even the landing itself, you have, you can be more precise, you could be more accurate with that landing.  Nujoud Merancy: Much more precise, right? With our advanced navigation and the electronics of the flash LIDAR, will be able to target a much more precise landing and if you start, you know, looking out into the future, you can always land beacons and things like that, and now you can fly to beacons so if you robotically land a beacon, now you can have even more precise landing, because basically you need to create a GPS around the Moon. [Laughter]  Host: That's right! So yeah, all these, all these technologies that can help you with an Artemis landing on the Moon, now returning to Earth, what were the constraints for Apollo with, we already kind of went through some of the different things with, you have this wider area that's in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, but I know one of the more interesting things that I read was this weather decision point. Because if you know, you have this big wide area, but if weather's bad, you're not landing there.  Nujoud Merancy: Right, for both Apollo and Artemis, you have the same constraint. When you targeted where you're landing in the ocean, you did that when you left the Moon, which was five days ago. And there's a lot that can happen in the weather in five days, so as you're coming back to Earth, for both of them, about a day before you get into the Earth's atmosphere, you have a choice to do a burn, to change where you target. So Apollo could move it about 1000 miles up range, and same with Orion, Orion can move it up to 1200 miles up range, so if there's you know, a hurricane, that's suddenly clogged your landing site, you need to move it away and the Navy will have to move their ships to get there so you can land away from the weather system. And so Orion using that skip entry and some retargeting, you can move it more than Apollo could. So you have a little bit of advantage there.  Host: Little bit of advantage. And then the other one, referring to lighting, one of the things I saw for Artemis, is that it is, I like this term, lighting agnostic. [Laughter]  Host: Yeah, so Apollo, you had to land in the daylight because they had to be able to see it, they put helicopters out there, they didn't have you know, night vision goggles, things like that, so you really, you had to land in the daylight, which is another big constraint on when you could go to the Moon, because first you needed your Moon to have lighting and then you need the ocean to have lighting when they come home. So that also narrows down how much of the month you can launch in. For Artemis, because we're dealing with rendezvouses, we want to go to the South Pole, which has a lot of constraints, we're really challenging the recovery teams to come up with a solution to land independent of lighting. So, using their advanced technology again, let's find a way to make sure that we aren't constrained to a night landing, or a daylight landing I should say.  Host: Yeah, and it's just, you kind of take it for granted, whenever you're watching the, like if you watch historical Apollo mission, you're like oh, look at that, they picked them up. And you don't even realize like, they had to pick that specific time, because they needed to have the lighting and they needed to pick that exact location because of the lighting, because of the communications, it's just all of these different plans have to come together perfectly to execute this mission, but it's like you don't even realize it.  Nujoud Merancy: Yeah, mission planning, it's sort of a hidden thing, right? You know you just sort of watch it and it's like of course it worked. But before you can launch it, you've got to make sure every piece and all the pieces are going to come together and everyone's doing their part. It's like party planning, right? You know, everyone needs to show up at the right time, with the right things.  Host: Now the programmatic differences between Apollo and Artemis, you kind of went over this a little bit for Apollo, it was national contractors, it was something called One Mission Unique?  Nujoud Merancy: Yeah, so they didn't reuse any hardware. It was you know, where you build it up, you fly it, you throw it all away, you land it again, and you're done. We don't have a lot of reusability in our program, but it's a lot of evolve ability, so we can actually move on Orion upgrades, the Gateway can add components over time, the lander can be upgraded, so how do you position these things and then, it's also looking Mars forward. So what you do on the Gateway, is basically demonstrating what you need for Mars vehicles in the future. So how do you demonstrate things in lunar orbit, the landers are very similar to what you're going to need on Mars, so what can we do now, around the Moon, to evolve into those long duration Mars vehicles?  Host: And then, for Apollo, you had to do it, I want to say by yourself, I mean you had national help, but it was a U.S. effort, Artemis, international.  Nujoud Merancy: Artemis and Artemis is very much intended to be international, and it already is international because the European Space Agency builds the majority of the service module on Orion, so we already have partnerships going and of course there's lots of working groups with the international community about how do they partner In Artemis going forward; whether that's equipment on the surface, equipment on Gateway, modules, things like that, so those discussions go on all the time and I'm very looking forward to seeing our international partners help us out.  Host: Very much so. And we have history to pull from, right? We have the Apollo Program, we did it, we landed on the Moon, it was amazing, and now we can take that knowledge and use it for Artemis. The difference with Apollo was like, and we mentioned this a million times, they had to build that from the ground up.  Nujoud Merancy: Right, a lot of those things from Apollo, we're really reusing them, I mean the vehicle assembly building, that very famous, enormous building at Kennedy Space Center, was built for Apollo. It stacked the shuttle, it launched all of the U.S. elements to the space station, and now it's going to stack SLS and Orion. So, even some of those features we have from Apollo, are still around helping us out today, and then a lot of the things, the physics didn't change. So how you design a trajectory to the Moon, a lot of that math is exactly the same, and we're just using it differently.  Host: Yeah, so, kind of to sum up, we've explored a lot of the differences, Apollo versus Artemis, why is it important to do it this way? To do Artemis to be sustainable, to have this sort of flexibility? Why is that important?  Nujoud Merancy: I think it's important and my personal perspective, right? Is to be flexible and evolvable. So you know, we did Apollo, they put the boot prints on the Moon, it was very expensive program in 1960's dollars, in 1970's dollars, and it was, but it could only accomplice so much. So now, in order to be sustainable, and evolvable, we have to sort of break things up into more pieces. You need to spread out the partnerships, but all of this is so that we can keep exploring. I hope we don't go to the Moon, say we did it again, and then stop going for another 50 years. I hope once we fly Artemis 3, that's just the first of many flights to the Moon and then Mars.  Host: Yeah, that's actually one of the things I remember the administrator saying was, one of the problems of Apollo was that it stopped. Right? We want to continue this. But I think it's important to not understate the value of Apollo. It was a life-changing program. It was, I mean, it redefined what was possible for humans.  Nujoud Merancy: Absolutely, it really set the standard for any program, that if you're going to achieve a lot in a very short time, you can't look at any other program in human history without look at all the technological advancements they had to accomplish just to pull that off. And now we're leveraging those to our benefit today and that's where the new technologies we can inject just makes it that much better.  Host: So, we've already alluded to this a little bit, but what are some of the exciting things we can look forward to for Artemis? We already talked about Artemis 1, 2, 3. What are we looking forward to?  Nujoud Merancy: So the next big exciting thing is going to be Artemis 1, and that'll be the launch of space launch system and Orion, hopefully just about a year from now, late 2020, and that's going to be 26-40 days long, it's going to send an un-crewed Orion around the Moon, so we're going to the Moon, and we're going soon. That will be without crew but then Artemis 2 will be the first flight of people beyond Low Earth orbit in over 50 years. So we've got a lot going on and we're very close to seeing these things happen.  Host: So one of the things I like to ask a lot of guests is, because this is the Johnson Space Center, because it is, we deal a lot with human space flight, why is it important to explore space with humans?  Nujoud Merancy: I think when you send the humans; you can give the science answer, right? Humans are smarter than computers, they can see the rock they need to pick up, you can do much more effective science very quickly with humans, but the big advantage to sending the humans is hope and belief, right? When we send humans, we believe in ourselves, and that's the value of human exploration, is it's actually, it's for us here on earth to believe in a little bit more, to believe we can do it when we go together.  Host: That is beautiful. Nujoud Merancy, thank you so much for coming back on Houston we have a Podcast, pleasure to have you.  Nujoud Merancy: So glad to be here again.

        description: '>> HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST. WELCOME TO THE OFFICIAL PODCAST OF THE NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, EPISODE 5: ASTRONAUT TRAINING. I’M GARY JORDAN AND I’LL BE YOUR HOST TODAY. SO THIS IS THE PODCAST WHERE WE BRING IN THE EXPERTS-- NASA SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, ASTRONAUTS-- ALL TO TELL YOU THE COOLEST THINGS ABOUT NASA. SO TODAY WE’RE TALKING ABOUT ASTRONAUT TRAINING WITH RANDY BRESNIK, KNOWN BY HIS COLLEAGUES AS KOMRADE. HE’S A U.S. ASTRONAUT HERE AT THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER IN HOUSTON, TEXAS. WELL, ACTUALLY, HE’S IN SPACE RIGHT NOW. HE JUST LAUNCHED FROM THE BAIKONUR COSMODROME AND ARRIVED AT THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION LAST WEEK, JULY 28th, TO START HIS LONG DURATION SPACE FLIGHT. BUT BEFORE HE LAUNCHED I HAD A CHANCE TO CHAT WITH HIM, AND WE HAD A GREAT DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT ASTRONAUTS HAVE TO STUDY, KNOW, AND ENDURE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SPACE. SO WITH NO FURTHER DELAY, LET’S GO LIGHT SPEED AND JUMP RIGHT INTO OUR TALK WITH MR. RANDY BRESNIK. ENJOY. [ MUSIC ] >> T MINUS FIVE SECONDS AND COUNTING. MARK. [ RADIO CHATTER, MUSIC ] >> HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST. [ MUSIC ] >> ALL RIGHT, WELL, THANKS FOR COMING, RANDY. I KNOW YOU HAD SOME BACK TO BACK STUFF GOING ON TODAY, SO I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING ACTUALLY THE TIME TO SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH ME FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT. AND SO CLOSE TO YOUR LAUNCH, TOO. I KNOW, LIKE, THIS-- IT’S GOING TO BE PRETTY BUSY UP UNTIL THE TIME THAT YOU ACTUALLY ARE IN SPACE. AND MAYBE BY THE TIME THIS PODCAST ACTUALLY GETS LAUNCHED, YOU WILL ACTUALLY BE THERE, SO THIS WILL BE KIND OF APPROPRIATE WITH HOW BUSY AND HOW QUICKLY THINGS ARE MOVING. SO TODAY, I KIND OF WANTED TO TALK ABOUT ASTRONAUT TRAINING. YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH IN ORDER TO PREPARE YOURSELF TO GO TO SPACE, AND THERE’S JUST SO MUCH-- IT HAS TO BE SO DIVERSE. NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE TO BE A JACK OF ALL TRADES, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE SORT OF LIKE A MASTER OF ALL OF THEM. I DID WANT TO START OFF WITH, THOUGH, FIRST OF ALL-- I’M READING YOUR NAME HERE. IT’S RANDY “KOMRADE” BRESNIK. WHAT’S THE STORY BEHIND KOMRADE? >> IT’S A CALL SIGN FROM THE MARINE CORPS. I COME FROM THE FIGHTER COMMUNITY, WHERE I WAS FLYING F-18s. AND TYPICALLY WE’VE ALWAYS HISTORICALLY GIVEN CALL SIGNS TO PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, GOING BACK TO WORLD WAR II-- “PAPPY” BOYINGTON. YOU KNOW, THESE ARE NICKNAMES THAT PEOPLE HAD. “INDIAN JOE” BAUER, YOU KNOW, WAS A SQUADRON COMMANDER BACK WHEN THE SQUADRON I WAS IN WAS IN WORLD WAR II. AND SO WE HAVE THESE CALL SIGNS, AND YOU GET ONE EITHER FOR YOUR NAME OR FOR SOMETHING YOU DONE STUPID. [ LAUGHTER ] AND SO AN EXAMPLE THAT MAKES IT REALLY EASY FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND IS THERE WAS A GUY WHO WAS IN TRAINING COMMAND. HE’S OUT THERE DOING [ INDISTINCT ] QUALS FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND IN THE CATAPULT GETTING READY TO GET LAUNCHED OFF THE BOW OF THE SHIP. THOSE THINGS ACCELERATE YOU FROM 0 TO 150 KNOTS IN UNDER 2 SECONDS. AND SO YOU ARE GOING FLYING BECAUSE THIS THING HAS SO MUCH MECHANICAL POWER. >> YEAH. >> WELL, HE KEPT HIS FEET ON THE BRAKES. [ LAUGHTER ] BRAKES WERE NOT GOING TO HOLD AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER FROM LAUNCHING HIM, AND SO, YOU KNOW, THE CATAPULT LAUNCHES, THE BRAKES-- THE BRAKES-- HE WAS HOLDING-- THE TIRES BLOW. AND SO HE ENDED UP WITH THE CALL SIGN “BAM BAM.” [ LAUGHTER ] AND SO, YOU KNOW, I DIDN’T HAVE ANYTHING THAT STUCK UNTIL I GOT TO THE F-18 TRAINING SQUADRON, AND ON MY FIRST FLIGHT WITH A MARINE INSTRUCTOR. AND HE ASKED IF I HAD A CALL SIGN, AND I SAID, “HEY, THEY’VE GIVEN ME THIS, THAT, THAT..." AND HE SAID, “NO, THOSE ALL STINK. I’LL THINK OF SOMETHING.” AND SO WE GO FLYING IN THE F-18. I HAD AN AMAZING TIME. YOU KNOW, IT WAS THE PLANE I ALWAYS WANTED TO FLY. IT WAS JUST A PHENOMENAL AIRPLANE. AND HE COME BACK IN THE DEBRIEF WHEN WE’RE DONE AND HE GOES, “ALL RIGHT, I HAVE A CALL SIGN FOR YOU.” I’M LIKE, “OKAY,” KNOWING THESE THINGS SOMETIMES CAN STICK. HE GOES, “BRESNIK, BRESNIK. THAT SOUNDS LIKE BREZHNEV. WE’RE GOING TO CALL YOU KOMRADE. KOMRADE BREZHNEV. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THAT WAS IT. AND I-- YOU KNOW, HERE I AM QUITE A FEW DECADES LATER, AND HAVEN’T DONE ANYTHING STUPID TO GET A NEW ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] >> BREZHNEV AFTER THE SOVIET LEADER? >> LEONID BREZHNEV, YEAH. >> OKAY, AND I GUESS EVERYONE CALLED EACH OTHER KOMRADE AS LIKE A-- >> THAT’S-- DURING SOVIET TIMES THAT WAS HOW EVERYBODY ADDRESSED THEMSELVES. >> HOW-- OKAY, I GET THE REFERENCE NOW. SO JUST AS A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND, BUT-- YOU’RE NAVY AND MARINES, IS THAT CORRECT? >> I AM A-- THE OVERALL ARCHING IS NAVAL AVIATOR, WHICH INCLUDES THE NAVY AND THE MARINE CORPS AVIATORS. WE WEAR THE SAME WINGS ON OUR FL-- WE EARN THE SAME WINGS IN FLIGHT SCHOOL AND WEAR THE SAME WINGS ON OUR FLIGHT SUITS. >> OKAY, SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LAUNCHING OFF OF CARRIERS AND THE MARINES-- >> RIGHT, THAT’S PART OF OUR OVERALL NAVAL AVIATOR TRAINING. SO I WAS TRAINED TO LAUNCH OFF AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER-- LAUNCHED A T-2, A-4, AND AN F-18. BUT THEN AS A MARINE WE DEPLOY EXPEDITIONARITY-- IS THAT EVEN A WORD? [ LAUGHTER ] >> WE’LL MAKE IT A WORD. >> WE’RE EXPEDITION BASED, BUT WE’LL LAUNCH AND ESTABLISH FORWARD BASES AND FLY OUT OF THERE, SO JUST FLYING OFF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER. >> OKAY, OKAY. NOW, YOU’RE GOING TO BE LAUNCHING SOON-- OR, DEPENDING ON WHEN THIS PODCAST IS RELEASED, YOU’RE IN SPACE RIGHT NOW-- BUT THIS IS NOT YOUR FIRST RODEO, RIGHT? YOU’VE BEEN IN SPACE BEFORE. YOU LAUNCHED IN 2009 ON STS-129 ABOARD ATLANTIS. HOW WAS THAT? >> STS-129 WAS REALLY NEAT. I HAD, FORTUNATELY, A REALLY GREAT CREW. WE HAD TWO MARINE TEST PILOTS, WE HAD TWO NAVY TEST PILOTS, AND WE HAD TWO SMART GUYS. [ LAUGHTER ] OUR SMART GUYS-- YOU KNOW, LELAND MELVIN, HERE HE IS, HE HAD BEEN DRAFTED INTO THE NFL, PLAYING FOOTBALL, BUT HAD A CAREER-ENDING INJURY, BUT HE FINISHED HIS EDUCATION, WENT BACK AND GOT HIS MASTER’S, BECAME A NASA ENGINEER, AND THEN BECAME AN ASTRONAUT. >> AWESOME. >> YEAH, AND THEN BECAUSE WE HAD THE TWO MARINES, YOU NEED TO, YOU KNOW, RAISE THE AVERAGE IQ ON THE FLIGHT, AND SO WE HAD BOBBY SATCHER, WHO IS MIT PhD IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING, AND THAT WASN’T ENOUGH SO HE WENT TO HARVARD AND BECAME A MEDICAL DOCTOR AS WELL-- YOU KNOW, ONCOLOGIST. AND SO HE WAS THERE TO TRY AND MAKE US ALL LOOK GOOD. >> MM-HMM. >> AND GREAT GUYS. BUTCH WILMORE, MYSELF, AND BOBBY WERE ALL FIRST TIME FLYERS. >> YEAH. >> BUT THE OTHER THREE EXPERIENCED CREW WERE PHENOMENAL MENTORS AND TAUGHT US HOW TO DO WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO ON OUR TRAINING SO WHEN WE WERE ABLE TO GO TO SPACE WE WERE ABLE TO EXECUTE VERY WELL, AND, YOU KNOW, HIT ALL THE TASKS WE NEEDED TO DURING THE MISSION AND CALL IT A SUCCESS. >> NOW, COMPARED TO LIKE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION MISSIONS NOW, I MEAN, WE’RE TALKING ABOUT SIX MONTHS ISH ON THE SPACE STATION. >> YEAH. >> THIS WAS RELATIVELY SHORT, RIGHT? JUST OVER TEN DAYS ABOARD. SO I MEAN, YOU REALLY HAD TO SOAK IT ALL IN FOR THOSE TEN DAYS. >> AND IT IS-- WE SAY THE SHUTTLE FLIGHTS WERE A SPRINT AND A STATION FLIGHT IS A MARATHON, YOU KNOW. >> RIGHT. >> YOU-- FOR A SHUTTLE FLIGHT, YOU TRAINED FOR EVERY MINUTE OF THAT FLIGHT BECAUSE IT’S ALL-- ONCE YOU LAUNCH, YOU’VE GOT EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY CHOCK FULL OF EVENTS. >> RIGHT. >> AND SO YOU’RE ABLE TO PRACTICE AND REHEARSE THAT. >> MM-HMM. >> WHEREAS, SPACE STATION, WE DON’T HAVE THAT LUXURY. I MEAN, YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU’RE DOING NEXT WEEK BECAUSE SOMETHING MAY BREAK, OR SOMETHING MAY CHANGE, OR PRIORITIES MAY BE ADJUSTED. AND SO WE DO SKILLS BASED TRAINING SO THAT IF I CAN DO THIS PARTICULAR TASK, WELL, I CAN DO A HUNDRED TASKS LIKE THAT. >> AND THIS IS FOR THE SPACE STATION. >> FOR SPACE STATION. >> YEAH. >> AND SO WE DO THE SKILLS BASED TRAINING SO I’VE GOT SKILLS IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT AREAS, AND WE’LL SEE HOW THAT SKILL WILL BE PUT TO USE MAYBE 10 OR 20, 30 DIFFERENT AREAS DURING THOSE 6 MONTHS, BUT I DON’T SIT THERE AND REHEARSE WHAT I’M DOING DAILY. >> RIGHT. SO WHEN YOU WERE ON THE SHUTTLE, YOU DID TWO EVAs, RIGHT? SO YOU REHEARSED THOSE. >> WE DID. >> AND YOU HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH-- YOU KNEW EXACTLY WHAT YOU WERE DOING. THIS WAS IN THE NEUTRAL BUOYANCY LABORATORY THAT YOU DID THAT? >> THE NEUTRAL BUOYANCY LAB-- WORLD’S LARGEST SWIMMING POOL. >> RIGHT. >> SIX MILLION GALLONS OF WATER. >> A LOT OF WATER. >> YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE SPACE STATION’S UNDERNEATH IT. WE USED TO HAVE THE SHUTTLE IN THERE WHEN WE WERE FLYING SHUTTLE. >> RIGHT. >> AND-- I DON’T KNOW. I’M TALKING WITH MY HANDS, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THIS IS A PODCAST. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU KNOW, IT’S JUST A PILOT THING. >> YOU LOOK GOOD WHEN YOU’RE DOING IT. I DON’T-- I CAN JUSTIFY THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] >> AND YOU KNOW, WE REHEARSED EACH EVA SIX OR SEVEN TIMES. I MEAN, EVERY SINGLE TIME, EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE DOING VERY WELL. AND HERE I AM, YOU KNOW, MONDAY I’M GOING FOR MY LAST NBL RUN HERE BEFORE THE FLIGHT. >> MM-HMM. >> AND YOU KNOW, WE’VE DONE A HANDFUL OF RUNS OF A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF SKILLS, NOT KNOWING IF I’LL DO ANY OF THOSE PARTICULAR THINGS I REHEARSED, OR I’LL BE DOING STUFF I COMPLETELY DID NOT REHEARSE. BUT I’VE GOT A WIDE ENOUGH SKILL BASE TO BE ABLE TO, YOU KNOW, DO ANYTHING THAT COMES-- YOU KNOW, THAT WE END UP HAVING TO HAVE HAPPEN, EITHER PLANNED OR UNPLANNED. >> YEAH, I MEAN, I HEAR A LOT OF TIMES THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU GO INTO THE NEUTRAL BUOYANCY LABORATORY AND IT KIND OF BECOMES ALMOST MUSCLE MEMORY. YOU KIND OF LIKE KNOW WHERE YOU’RE GOING, YOU KNOW THE, I GUESS, LAY OF THE LAND A LITTLE BIT. >> THAT’S THE WHOLE POINT. >> YEAH. >> YOU KNOW, WITH ANY OF THE TRAINING WE DO, SPACE IS SUCH A UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT PHYSICALLY, BECAUSE YOUR BODY’S FEELING THE WEIGHTLESSNESS. >> MM-HMM. >> VISUALLY, BECAUSE YOU’RE SEEING THE WHOLE EARTH GO UNDERNEATH YOU, AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU’RE OUTSIDE IN THAT SPACE SUIT-- YOU KNOW, YOUR OWN PERSONAL SPACECRAFT-- AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU’RE UNDERNEATH AND YOU’RE HOLDING ONTO SOMETHING, AND YOU LOOK DOWN AND YOUR WHOLE LIFE HAD TOLD YOU-- “WOW, THERE’S NOTHING BETWEEN ME AND THE EARTH BUT MY BOOTS, AND THAT’S 200 MILES. IF I LET GO, I’M GOING TO FALL.” BECAUSE YOUR WHOLE LIFE HAS TAUGHT YOU THAT HERE ON EARTH. >> YEAH. >> AND IT’S A PHYSICAL THING YOU HAVE TO OVERCOME. AND SO TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE MUSCLE MEMORY TO GO, “I JUST GO TO THIS SPOT. I PUT MY TETHER HERE. I PULL OUT THIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT,” YOU CAN RELY ON THAT AND GIVE YOU THE COMFORTABILITY OF THE TRAINING. >> MM-HMM. >> THEN YOU’RE ABLE TO NOT HAVE IT BE SUCH AN OVERWHELMING OR PHYSICALLY STRESSFUL EVENT. >> OKAY. WELL, SO ONE COOL THING ABOUT YOUR TWO EVAs IS SOMETHING HAPPENED IN BETWEEN THERE. YOU WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT? >> SURE. I LEFT EARTH WITH MY WIFE AND SON WATCHING, AND MY DAUGHTER, WHO WAS NINE MONTHS IN THE WOMB AT THE TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU KNOW, THE FUNNY THING WAS THE MORNING OF THAT LAUNCH WE STRAP IN, AND THE WEATHER WAS IFFY, AND REALLY, IT WAS GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE LAUNCH, YOU KNOW, UP UNTIL 15 MINUTES BEFORE LAUNCH, OUR COMMANDER, WHO HAD THE BEST VIEW, WAS KIND OF GOING, “YEAH, IT’S NOT LOOKING SO GOOD, GUYS.” AND SO WE STARTED KIND OF GETTING PREPARED THAT HEY, WE MIGHT ACTUALLY SCRUB. AND WE’RE HEARING THE CALLS OVER THE RADIO, AND THE GUY WHO’S THE S.T.A. PILOT SAID, “HEY, THERE’S A HOLE THAT’S COMING OVER HERE,” AND WE CAME OUT OF A NINE-MINUTE HOLD BECAUSE THERE WAS A HOLE THAT WAS JUST ALIGNING WEATHER-WISE THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO LAUNCH, AND WE CAME OUT OF THAT NINE-MINUTE HOLD GOING, “WE’RE GOING.” WE WERE LIKE, “WOW, THAT’S GREAT!” BUT, YOU KNOW, AT THAT POINT, I KNEW THAT, HEY, I WASN’T GOING TO BE AROUND FOR THE BIRTH OF OUR DAUGHTER. >> RIGHT. >> AND SO WE LAUNCH, WE GET GOING ON THE MISSION, WE GET DOCKED TO THE SPACE STATION, WE KNOCK OUT OUR FIRST SPACEWALK. I’M THE I.V., OR THE GUY BEING BASICALLY THE DIRECTOR OF THE TWO GUYS OUT THERE ON THE EVA. >> MM-HMM. >> AND THE PLAN WAS, YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE SHE HAD TO BE INDUCED, THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE HER DELIVER THE NEXT DAY, BEFORE MY FIRST EVA. AND SO THEY INDUCED MY WIFE, AND ABIGAIL DIDN’T COME OUT. >> OH! [ LAUGHTER ] >> SHE DID NOT COME. AND SO WE WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING, AND I’M EXPECTING TO WAKE UP THE MORNING OF MY FIRST EVA AND FIND OUT THAT MY WIFE GAVE BIRTH. WELL, SHE’S STILL IN LABOR. THAT’S NOT GOOD. AND SO-- BUT THE EVAs HAPPEN, AND WE PRACTICE IT THESE SIX TIMES, AND THE MISSION’S GOT TO GO, SO I HAD TO COMPARTMENTALIZE AND GO, “OKAY.” AND WE HAD THE THING-- YOU KNOW, ONCE WE START PREPPING FOR THE EVA, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER HAPPENS, I DON’T FIND OUT ABOUT IT TILL WE ACTUALLY COME BACK IN THE DOOR. SO, GET SUITED UP TO OUR WORK, GO OUT THE DOOR FOR MY FIRST EVA. YOU KNOW, THINKING ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS I WAS KIND OF EXPECTING WHEN I CAME BACK IN THAT-- TO HEAR THAT SHE WOULD’VE BEEN BORN. >> YEAH. >> AND JUST THINK, “WOW, WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT I’M OUTSIDE ON A SPACEWALK THE SAME TIME MY WIFE’S GIVING BIRTH TO OUR DAUGHTER?” AND SO WE COME BACK IN, YOU KNOW, PUT ON THE RACK, AND THEY PULL OFF OUR HELMET, I’M LIKE-- >> “IS SHE BORN? IS SHE BORN?” >> NOTHING! STILL IN LABOR. >> NO! [ LAUGHTER ] >> SO I’M FEELING REALLY BAD FOR MY WIFE. >> YEAH. >> YOU KNOW, SOMETHING US MEN JUST REALLY DON’T UNDERSTAND, AND TO HAVE IT GO THAT LONG, I KNOW IT’S JUST VERY PAINFUL. AND UNFORTUNATELY, IT WAS. BUT IN THE END, SHE GOT TO BE THERE AND GIVE BIRTH TO OUR DAUGHTER. AND SO THE NEXT-- THAT NIGHT, GO TO SLEEP, AND EXPECTING TO HEAR IN THE MORNING THAT OUR DAUGHTER WAS BORN. I ENDED UP HAVING TO GET UP TO USE THE FACILITIES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, AND I SAW THE KU BAND PASS, SO I QUICK CALLED DOWN, AND GET A HOLD OF HER SISTER ON THE CELL PHONE, AND SHE’S LIKE, “SHE’S STILL IN LABOR.” >> STILL! OH, MY. >> SO I-- YEAH, THEY WERE PRETTY BUSY DOWN THERE, SO I JUST KIND OF PUT THE PHONE DOWN ON THE TABLE NEXT TO THE-- IN THE DELIVERY ROOM, AND SO I WAS ABLE TO HEAR THE SOUNDS OF THE DELIVERY ROOM UNTIL THE KU PASS WENT DOWN, AND TURNS OUT SHE WAS BORN ABOUT 20 MINUTES AFTER THE KU PASS ENDED. >> NO! YOU JUST MISSED IT. >> SO WHEN I GOT UP THE NEXT MORNING, THE MORNING WAKE UP SONG WAS “BUTTERFLY KISSES” THAT MY WIFE HAD PICKED OUT AS THE SONG TO PLAY THE MORNING OUR DAUGHTER’S BORN. >> SO YOU KNEW. >> THAT’S HOW I KNEW, BUT I HADN’T HEARD FROM MY WIFE YET. I SAID, “THEY’RE PLAYING THE SONG. DOES THAT MEAN IT HAPPENED?” SO A FEW MINUTES LATER, THEY PATCHED MY WIFE THROUGH, AND I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO HER. >> THAT IS AMAZING. TALK ABOUT-- I MEAN, YOU USED THE WORD COMPARTMENTALIZE. THAT, I CAN’T EVEN IMAGINE. YOU’RE LIKE-- YOU’RE SO CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR WIFE, AND YOU’RE LIKE, “BUT I HAVE THIS EVA TO DO, AND I NEED TO FOCUS.” >> THE WHOLE, YOU KNOW, SP-- OUR WHOLE SHUTTLE CREW AND OUR WHOLE STS-129 TEAM AND OUR WHOLE SPACE PROGRAM GOT US TO THAT POINT TO DO THAT EVA TO DO THIS CONSTRUCTION STUFF. >> RIGHT. >> AND YEAH, THERE’S NOT-- FAILURE’S NOT AN OPTION, YOU KNOW. YOU’VE GOT TO FOCUS. >> YEAH. >> AND THEN, CERTAINLY, WHEN YOU’RE OUTSIDE IN YOUR OWN PERSONAL SPACE SUIT-- SPACECRAFT-- YOU KNOW, IN THE MOST INHOSPITABLE LOCATION KNOWN TO MAN BECAUSE IT’S +250 DEGREES IN THE SUN AND -250 DEGREES IN THE SHADE, THERE’S NO MARGIN FOR ERROR. AND SO YOU HAVE TO COMPARTMENTALIZE, AND SO AS A PILOT AND A TEST PILOT THAT WAS THE MOST-- YOU KNOW, THE CULMINATION OF MY CAREER. “I’M IN SPACE. NOW I’M GOING ON A SPACEWALK. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!” AND THE VIEW WAS JUST INDESCRIBABLY BEAUTIFUL. >> MM-HMM. >> AND THEN THE VERY NEXT DAY, TO HAVE SOMETHING SURPASS THAT WAS JUST VERY FORTUNATE, VERY BLESSED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE EXPERIENCED THAT. >> WOW. >> I WISH I COULD’VE BEEN THERE FOR MY WIFE AND BEEN THERE AT THE DELIVERY, BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT WAS NOT THE PLAN FOR US, AND SO WE WERE JUST GIVEN GRACE WE WERE ABLE TO DO OUR JOBS IN RESPECTIVE AREAS OF THE PLANET-- OR OFF-PLANET-- AND GOOD NEWS AFTER THAT. AND THE NEXT DAY, WAITING THE WHOLE DAY, YOU KNOW, WAITING UNTIL I COULD FINALLY SEE PICTURES. >> RIGHT. >> AND GET A LITTLE VIDEO SENT TO ME. AND THEN A FEW MINUTES AFTER THAT, I WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO GET ON A TWO-WAY VIDEO CONFERENCE WITH MY WIFE AND SEE HER, AND HEAR HER LITTLE VOICE. AND THAT WAS PRETTY SPECIAL, BUT LITERALLY, MY COMMANDER WAS AT THE NODE 2 WAITING UNTIL I FINISHED, KIND OF TAPPING HIS WATCH, BECAUSE AS SOON AS I HUNG UP FROM THAT VIDEO CONFERENCE, I HAD TO FLOAT DOWN INTO THE AIRLOCK AND CLOSE THE HATCH, AND BOBBY SATCHER AND I HAD TO DEPRESS FOR-- DOWN TO 10.2 PSIs FOR THE OVERNIGHT CAMP-OUT TO GET THE NITROGEN OUT OF OUR BODIES FOR THE EVA THE NEXT DAY, WHERE NOW I’M THE EV 1, I’M THE LEAD FOR THE SPACEWALK. >> OH, WOW. >> SO BACK TO THE-- COMPARTMENTALIZE TO THE LAST SPACEWALK OF THE FLIGHT. >> WOW. ALL RIGHT, “MY DAUGHTER’S BORN. THAT’S COOL. OKAY, NOW I’VE GOT TO GO--” YEAH, I-- THAT’S JUST WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. AND THEN THAT WAS A, I GUESS, OVERNIGHT PURGING. THEY DON’T DO THAT ANYMORE, RIGHT? THEY JUST DO-- >> WE DON’T-- WE DO IT-- CALLED IN SUIT LIGHT EXERCISE. >> I SEE. >> WHERE WE’RE ABLE TO USE LESS OVERALL OXYGEN FROM THE STATION TO BE MORE EFFICIENT WITH THE OXYGEN WE HAVE UP THERE. >> AH, MAKES SENSE. OKAY. WELL, SO NOW YOU’RE GEARING UP FOR A SIX-MONTH JOURNEY. SO TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SORT OF TRAINING THAT HAS TO GO-- YOU KNOW, I GUESS, A LITTLE BIT-- HOW IS IT DIFFERENT IN GENERAL FROM SHUTTLE TRAINING? BUT JUST WHAT ALL DO YOU HAVE TO DO TO PREPARE YOURSELF? LIKE, WHAT KINDS OF TRAINING DOES AN ASTRONAUT HAVE TO DO TO BE UP THERE FOR SIX MONTHS? >> CERTAINLY THERE’S A LOT OF, YOU KNOW, STATION TRAINING BECAUSE YOU’RE UP THERE FOR SO MUCH AND YOU’VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO DO EVERYTHING. YOU’VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO EXECUTE THE PAYLOADS AND EXPERIMENTS. AT THE SAME TIME, YOU’VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO DO THE EARTH’S OBSERVATION. YOU’VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO DO THE EVENTS, SO TALK TO PEOPLE DOWN HERE ON THE EARTH AND SHARE THE EXPERIENCE, ON TOP OF BEING THE JANITOR. YOU’VE GOT TO CLEAN UP THE VENTS AND WIPE DOWN THE HANDRAILS, AND MAKE SURE THE STATION IS IN CLEAN SITUATION. >> YEAH. >> WE’VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO FIX THINGS THAT BREAK. TOILET BREAKS, YOU’RE NOT CALLING THE PLUMBER. YOU ARE THE PLUMBER! >> YOU ARE THE PLUMBER. >> YEAH, YOU ARE THE SCIENTIST, YOU ARE THE PLUMBER, YOU ARE THE FIX AND REPAIR MAN. >> YEAH. >> AND SO THAT’S WHERE A LOT OF THE TRAINING IS, IS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SKILLS BASED STUFF IS HOW DO I GO AHEAD AND FIX THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF THING? HOW DO I WORK THIS TYPE OF FITTING, WHICH IS ON A HUNDRED DIFFERENT PIECES OF EQUIPMENT, BUT I KNOW HOW TO WORK THAT FITTING, YOU KNOW? >> I SEE. >> IMPORTANT STUFF, LIKE OUR REGENERATIVE ECLS SYSTEMS, YOU KNOW, THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL AND LIFE SUPPORT-- THE OXYGEN GENERATOR, THE CARBON DIOXIDE SCRUBBER, THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. >> GOT TO LEARN HOW TO FIX THAT, YEAH. >> REALLY IMPORTANT TO STATION, AND SO WE’VE GOT TO LEARN IN DEPTH HOW TO FIX THOSE IF THEY BREAK. >> RIGHT. >> THAT’S THE STUFF THAT WE REALLY-- YOU KNOW, WE’RE PROVING-- I SAY IT’S A PROVING GROUND FOR EXPLORATION, BECAUSE WHEN WE LAUNCH TO MARS, WE CAN’T HAVE SPARE SETUP. WE CAN’T, IF THERE’S A PROBLEM, JUST DEORBIT AND COME BACK TO EARTH IN A COUPLE HOURS. WE’VE GOT TO HAVE IT ALL THERE. IT’S ALL GOT TO WORK, AND IT’S GOT TO KEEP WORKING FOR YEARS AT A TIME TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE, DO OUR MISSION, THEN COME BACK. >> YEAH. >> AND SO WE’RE PROVING THOSE TECHNOLOGIES NOW. >> THAT’S AMAZING. >> AND WITH THE CURRENT TIME WHERE WE DON’T HAVE THE SHUTTLE AND WE DON’T HAVE OUR STARLINER OR OUR DRAGON CREWED VEHICLES YET, OUR ONLY WAY TO SPACE IS THROUGH OUR RUSSIAN PARTNERS. >> THAT’S RIGHT-- SOYUZ. >> AND SO 60% OF THE TIME OF MY LAST YEAR AND A HALF HAS BEEN IN RUSSIA. >> OH! >> TRAINING TO LAUNCH, YOU KNOW, RENDEZVOUS, DOCK, AND THEN LAND ON THE SOYUZ. >> SO WHAT’S YOUR ROLE ON THE SOYUZ? >> ON THE SOYUZ I’M IN THE LEFT SEAT, WHAT THEY CALL THE FLIGHT ENGINEER. >> OKAY. >> AND SO MY RUSSIAN CREWMATE, SERGEY RYAZANSKY, IS IN THE CENTER SEAT. HE’S THE COMMANDER OF THE SOYUZ. AND SO BETWEEN THE TWO OF US, WE WORK AND RUN ALL THE SYSTEMS WITHIN THE SOYUZ. AND THEN OUR FLIGHT ENGINEER NUMBER 2-- NOW, BECAUSE WE’VE CHANGED CREWS A LITTLE BIT HERE RECENTLY-- >> RIGHT. >> PAOLO NESPOLI FROM ITALY. AND SO THE THREE OF US WILL BE LAUNCHING JULY 28th. >> SO 60% OF YOUR TIME, I GUESS, YOU SAID FOR THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF HAS BEEN OVER THERE-- WOW. THAT’S-- IT MUST BE A COMPLICATED SYSTEM THEN, RIGHT? >> IT’S COMPLICATED. THERE’S ALSO THE RUSSIAN SEGMENT TRAINING THAT WE GET, BECAUSE THAT’S A GOOD HALF A STATION. WE TYPICALLY DON’T WORK DOWN THERE DAILY, BUT ESPECIALLY JUST BEING-- I GUESS I’LL BE THE COMMANDER OF THE ISS FOR EXPEDITION 53. I KIND OF NEED TO KNOW WHAT’S GOING ON IN THE WHOLE STATION. >> YEAH. >> SO I GET TRAINING SO I CAN BE HELPFUL TO THOSE GUYS, KNOW WHAT’S GOING ON, AND THEN IF NECESSARY, MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THE HEALTH OF THE ENTIRE SPACE STATION. >> THAT’S AWESOME. SO WHAT KIND-- YOU KNOW, YOU’RE THERE FOR SO LONG. WHAT ARE YOU GOING OVER? ARE YOU GOING OVER MOSTLY HOW TO WORK THE THING? OR, YOU KNOW, IF THIS GOES WRONG, THIS IS WHAT’S-- LIKE, EMERGENCY SITUATIONS? >> MOSTLY THAT. >> OH, I SEE. >> AND THAT’S THE SAME THING, BECAUSE IT’S A DYNAMIC FLYING VEHICLE. THAT’S THE DANGEROUS PART OF THE MISSION. >> MM-HMM. >> SAME THING WITH SHUTTLE. WE DID SO MANY SIMS JUST FOR ASCENT, ENTRY, AND LANDING. >> MM-HMM. >> AND FORTUNATELY, THE MAJORITY OF THAT TRAINING THAT WE GOT, WE NEVER HAD TO USE. BUT IF YOU HAD TO USE IT, YOUR LIFE DEPENDED ON IT, YOU KNOW. AND IT WAS VERY TIME CRITICAL, SO THAT’S WHY COSTS AND REHEARSAL OVER THOSE THINGS. >> RIGHT. >> NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT YOU’RE IN RUSSIA AND DOING THIS STUFF IN RUSSIA, AND THAT THERE’S A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA MARGIN THAT YOU HAVE TO ADD FOR THAT, BECAUSE THAT’S NOT ONE OF THE EASIER LANGUAGES. >> I HEAR THAT’S ONE OF THE MORE DIFFICULT PARTS OF TRAINING, IS RUSSIAN LANGUAGE. THAT’S-- YOU’RE RIGHT, IT’S VERY DIFFICULT. I’M STARTING TRAINING HERE IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS, AND I’M NERVOUS. I’M VERY NERVOUS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I MEAN, BEING AN ASTRONAUT, THOUGH, IS NOT JUST FLYING THE VEHICLES AND FIXING STUFF, YOU KNOW. YOU HAVE TO BE IN TIP TOP SHAPE, RIGHT? THERE’S A PHYSICAL ELEMENT TO IT. EVERY ASTRONAUT IS JUST IN SUPER GOOD-- DO YOU GUYS HAVE LIKE-- DO YOU HAVE PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS? LIKE YOU HAVE TO WORK OUT THIS MUCH TIME? OR, YOU KNOW, EVEN MEDICAL-- DO YOU HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO, IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY, PATCH SOMEONE UP OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? >> ALL RIGHT, SO SOUNDS LIKE TWO QUESTIONS THERE. >> I GUESS IT IS TWO QUESTIONS, YES. >> YEAH, CERTAINLY THE WORK OUT POINT, THE BETTER SHAPE YOUR BODY IS IN, THE BETTER IT WILL BE ABLE TO RESPOND AND ADAPT TO ZERO GRAVITY AND THEN MAINTAIN ITSELF WHEN IT DOESN’T HAVE GRAVITY TO HELP KEEP YOUR BONES STRONG AND YOUR MUSCLES STRONG AND ALL THAT. SO THAT’S CERTAINLY ONE OF THE BIGGER CONCERNS ABOUT LEAVING, YOU KNOW, YOU VAN ALLEN RADIATION BELT, WHICH PROTECTS US HERE IN LOW EARTH ORBIT AND ON THE PLANET, AND GOING TO FAR OFF DESTINATIONS. HOW DO WE PROTECT THE PHYSICAL BODY OF THE CREW SO THAT WHEN THEY GET TO SOMEWHERE THEY CAN DO THE EXPLORATION WE WANT TO DO? >> MM-HMM. >> SO THERE’S A LOT OF US EITHER-- THE PROTECTION FROM RADIATION, THERE’S PROTECTION FROM ZERO GRAVITY, AND WE DO HAVE A LOT OF COUNTERMEASURES DOWN. THAT’S WHY SPACE STATION AND BEING UP THERE FOR SIX MONTHS GIVES US REALLY GOOD INSIGHT, IS TO DO-- YOU KNOW, SINCE YOU DON’T GET THE SUN. YOU KNOW, CAN WE UP YOUR VITAMIN D? CAN WE GET THE CERTAIN DIET? CAN WE GET THE PROPER EXERCISE WITH AEROBIC AND ANAEROBIC EXERCISE TO KEEP THE BODY FROM, YOU KNOW, DETERIORATING IN ZERO G, WHICH IT WOULD NORMALLY DO. YOU KNOW, THEY SAY BEING UP THERE IS LIKE A PERSON HAVING OSTEOPOROSIS. AND SO YOU CAN’T JUST DO NOTHING, OTHERWISE YOU COME BACK IN BAD SHAPE HAVING LOST A LOT OF BONE. >> SO YOU TRAIN HOW TO USE THE, I GUESS, WORKOUT EQUIPMENT. >> RIGHT, THE WORKOUT EQUIPMENT, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, AMAZING. THE ADVANCED RESISTIVE EXERCISE DEVICE IS A [ INDISTINCT ] THAT DOES ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT STUFF, AND PEOPLE ARE COMING BACK IN BETTER SHAPE THAN THEY LEAVE SOMETIMES. PART IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO DEDICATE A COUPLE HOURS EVERY DAY TO WORKING OUT. >> RIGHT. >> YOU KNOW, YOUR BODY-- YOU KNOW, HERE ON EARTH, STANDING UP AND SITTING DOWN OUT OF A CHAIR, GETTING OUT OF BED, GETTING OUT OF YOUR CAR, WALKING TO WORK-- THOSE LITTLE THINGS THAT YOU DO IF YOU’RE NOT QUOTE “EXERCISING” LIKE WE WOULD THINK, YOU’RE STILL-- YOUR BODY’S MOVING. IN SPACE, YOU’RE FLOATING AROUND. YOU’RE NOT DOING ANYTHING DIFFICULT ALL DAY LONG. SO THAT’S THE ONLY EXERCISE YOU REALLY GET. >> AH. YEAH, BECAUSE OTHERWISE THERE WOULD BE THAT KIND OF NATURAL DETERIORATION. >> YEAH. >> WOW. WE HAD AN EPISODE BEFOREHAND WHERE WE TALKED WITH JOHN CHARLES, WHERE IF YOUR BODY DOESN’T NEED YOUR BONES AND MUSCLES BECAUSE IT’S NOT USING IT AS MUCH, THEN YOUR BODY SAYS, “ALL RIGHT, WE DON’T NEED TO PUT ANY ENERGY TOWARDS THAT.” >> EXACTLY. >> YEAH. >> AND SO THEN THE MEDICAL QUESTION, YEAH, I MEAN, THERE’S NO DOCTORS THERE. SO WE TRAIN TO KIND OF HAVE TELEMEDICINE AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT ARE REALLY-- TECHNOLOGY’S REALLY ALLOWING US TO DO WELL NOW THESE DAYS. >> MM-HMM. >> WE’RE THE EYES AND EARS FOR THE DOCTOR. WE’RE LIKE SPACE EMTs. WE CAN DO THE INITIAL TRIAGE. AND WE TRAIN FOR SOMEBODY WHO’S NOT BREATHING, OR SOMEONE WHO’S HAD-- THEY DON’T HAVE A HEARTBEAT. >> RIGHT. >> WE CAN TAKE CARE OF ALL THAT STUFF ON ORBIT, STABILIZE HIM, AND THEN GET THE DOCS INVOLVED AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO FOLLOW-ON TREATMENT, OR, IF NECESSARY FOR MEDICAL EMERGENCY, EVACUATION OF THE SPACE STATION. >> AND YOU GUYS ARE RUNNING THROUGH THESE PROCEDURES KIND OF REPETITIVELY, I WOULD ASSUME, RIGHT? YEAH. >> YEP, GOT TO BUILD THE MUSCLE MEMORY, YOU KNOW. AND FORTUNATELY WE’VE GOT GREAT PROCEDURES AND GREAT TRAINING THAT ALLOWS IT TO BE-- OKAY, WE CAN GET THE PERSON TO HERE BY STUFF THAT WE’VE LEARNED AND MEMORIZED, AND THEN WE OPEN UP THE [ INDISTINCT ] AND GO, “OKAY, HERE’S WHERE WE’RE AT.” AND THEN WE CAN SYNC UP WITH THE GROUND AND GO, “HERE’S WHAT’S NEXT. HEY, DOC, YOU GOT ANY OTHER IDEA? HERE’S A VIDEO CAMERA PICTURE OF THE PATIENT. HERE’S WHAT WE’RE SEEING. OKAY, WE ALL AGREE. WE SHOULD GIVE HIM THIS PARTICULAR, YOU KNOW, MEDICINE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT THEY NEED.” SO IT’S REALLY A GROUP EFFORT. >> I’M IMAGINING-- I WAS A LIFEGUARD WAY BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL, AND I’M IMAGINING JUST KIND OF LIKE THAT BUT A MILLION TIMES MORE COMPLICATED. BECAUSE IT’S THE SAME THING, RIGHT? YOU’RE SITTING AND WATCHING A POOL, BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE SOMETHING GOES WRONG AND YOU’VE GOT TO KNOW WHAT TO DO. SO YOU HAVE KIND OF A UNIQUE SET OF EXPERIENCES. NOT ONLY ARE YOU AN ASTRONAUT, BUT YOU’RE AN AQUANAUT AND A CAVENAUT. I WANT TO START WITH THE CAVENAUT. WHAT IS A CAVENAUT? WHAT DID YOU DO IN A CAVE? I GUESS YOU LIVED IN A CAVE, RIGHT? >> WE DID. THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY, BACK IN 2011, STARTED THIS EXPEDITIONARY AND EXTREME ENVIRONMENT TRAINING CALLED CAVES. >> OKAY. >> AND THEY ORIGINALLY PLANNED IT AS KIND OF A COOPERATIVE BEHAVIOR THING, KIND OF MORE OF A-- HOW DO YOU GET ALONG WITH PEOPLE IN-- YOU KNOW, PUT THE ASTRONAUTS ALL TOGETHER AND PUT THEM IN LITTLE STRESSFUL SITUATIONS AND SEE HOW THEY EVOLVE, AND HOW THEY-- YOU KNOW, THE PERSONALITY SKILLS AND THAT KIND OF STUFF. >> MM-HMM. >> AND IT WAS IN THE CAVES, THE VAST, VAST UNDERGROUND CAVE SYSTEM IN SARDINIA, ITALY, WHICH IS AN ISLAND OFF THE WEST COAST OF THE MAIN BODY OF ITALY. >> OKAY. >> AND SO YOU START OUT, JUST LIKE ON ANY TRAINING, WITH BASIC CAVING STUFF, AND RAPPELLING, AND CLIMBING. AND THEN YOU WENT INTO [ INDISTINCT ] IN A DAY WHERE YOU’RE IN THESE REALLY NARROW CAVES AND IT’S REALLY WINDING ABOUT, GETTING LOST, AND NAVIGATION, AND BEING ABLE TO GO THROUGH SQUEEZES, AND NAVIGATING THROUGH TINY AREAS OF THE CAVE TO BE ABLE TO OVERCOME ANY CLAUSTROPHOBIA OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. ANOTHER DAY WE DID A WHOLE SPACE PHOTOG-- OR CAVE PHOTOGRAPHY AND HOW TO MAP OUT AND ALLOW US TO MAKE MAPS FROM THE DATA WE COLLECT IN THE CAVES, FROM LASER RANGE FIRED, HOW BIG IS THE ROOM, WHAT SHAPE IS IT, HOW IS THE INCLINATION. PUT THAT ALL TOGETHER TO THE FINAL EXERCISE, WHICH IS A WEEK UNDERGROUND. AND YOU HEAD IN A KILOMETER AND A HALF FROM THE OPENING OF THE CAVE. >> OOH. >> AND THAT’S WHERE THE BASE CAMP WAS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WE’RE IN THIS TENS OF KILOMETERS LONG CAVE, AND THERE WAS A POINT WHERE THE MAPS ENDED, AND OUR JOB WAS TO GO OUT EVERY DAY AND MAP OUT NEW PARTS OF THE CAVE. SO WE DECIDED WHAT HOLE, DARK SPOT, TO GO INTO AND CHECK OUT-- SEE IF THAT WAS A DEAD END OR IF THAT WAS SOMEWHERE TO GO, AND GOING BACK FURTHER AND FURTHER INTO THE CAVE. AND YOU KNOW, IT’S AMAZING GOING THROUGH A TINY AREA-- KIND OF LIKE SQUEEZING THROUGH A TOILET SEAT, ALMOST, YOU KNOW-- AND OPENING UP TO A CATHEDRAL SIZED ROOM UNDERGROUND. YOU’RE GOING, “HOLY-- I’M UNDERGROUND. LOOK AT THIS HUGE AREA!” >> WHOA. >> THERE WERE NO TRAILS, NO LIGHTS, NO GUARDRAILS. >> RIGHT, BECAUSE YOU’RE MAPPING IT, YOU’RE DISCOVERING IT. >> YOU’RE MAPPING IT. YOU FEEL-- VERY FEW HUMANS HAVE EVER SEEN THIS. >> RIGHT. >> AND IT’S UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU’VE EVER SEEN ON THE EARTH OR SEEN PICTURES OF. I MEAN, IT’S JUST-- >> WOW. >> AND SO YOU GOT THIS REAL FEELING FOR EXPLORING. YOU’RE LIKE, “OKAY, I’M EXCITED AND READY. HEY, WE CAN EITHER GO THIS WAY OR THAT WAY. LET’S GO THAT WAY TODAY AND LET’S SEE WHAT’S OVER THERE!” >> THAT’S SO COOL. >> AND SO IT WAS REALLY, REALLY AN ENJOYABLE THING TO DO WITH THESE OTHER PEOPLE, OTHER ASTRONAUTS WHO ARE JUST AS EXCITED ABOUT THIS EXPLORING, TOO. AND REALLY APPLICABLE TO WHAT WE DO IN SPACE, BECAUSE WHAT THEY FOUND FROM DOING THESE CAVES EXERCISE IS THAT THERE’S A LOT MORE SPACE APPLICATIONS THAN THEY THOUGHT. BECAUSE IN SPACE, YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS, BECAUSE EVERY 45 MINUTES, YOU GET A SUNRISE, AND THEN A SUNSET, AND THAT GOES-- HAPPENS 16 TIMES A DAY. >> RIGHT. >> WELL, IN A CAVE IT’S DARK ALL THE TIME, SO YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS. YOU COULD JUST BE MARCHING ALONG, DOING STUFF AND REALIZE, “OH, MY. WHY DO I FEEL TIRED? OH, I’VE BEEN UP FOR 20 HOURS!” YOU KNOW, “I FORGOT TO EAT!” BECAUSE IT’S JUST-- I DIDN’T HAVE, “OH YEAH, IT’S LUNCHTIME,” YOU KNOW. >> YEAH, YOU KIND OF HAVE TO ADJUST, LIKE MAKE UP, ALMOST, A BIOLOGICAL CLOCK AS YOU DON’T HAVE A SUN. >> AND THEY’RE LIKE-- SO THERE’S NO GUARDRAILS, THERE’S NO PATHS. THERE DEFINITELY IS AN APPARENT FEAR OF DEATH. YOU COULD BE DOING STUFF WITH YOUR-- ATTACHED ONTO A GUIDELINE, AND IT COULD BE 200 FEET-- IF YOU TAKE A SLIP AND YOU’RE NOT ATTACHED, YOU’RE 200 FEET. >> WHOA. >> I MEAN, IT’S VERY MUCH LIKE BEING IN SPACE WHERE IF YOU’RE ON A SPACEWALK AND SOMETHING GOES WRONG AND YOU’RE NOT TETHERED PROPERLY, YOU KNOW, IT’S A BAD DAY. >> WOW. DID YOU-- I MEAN, ONCE YOU GOT SET UP, I GUESS, ON BASE CAMP, DID YOU LIGHT UP EVERYTHING SO YOU COULD SEE A LITTLE BIT? OR WAS IT PRETTY MUCH-- >> YOU HAD YOUR HELMET LIGHT. THAT WAS IT. >> THAT WAS IT? THE ENTIRE TIME? >> AND YOU GOT USED TO IT. AND THAT WAS PRETTY NEAT. AND SO THAT MADE PHOTOGRAPHY REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS YOU’D PUT THE THING ON MANUAL, OPEN THE SHUTTER, AND THEN YOU’D TAKE A FLASH. AND YOU’D HIT IT A COUPLE DIFFERENT TIMES AND JUST POINT IT AT DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE CAVE, TRYING TO NOT POINT IT AT THE CAMERA, KIND OF SHIELD IT WITH YOUR BODY, SO YOU COULD LIGHT UP DIFFERENT CELLS. SO IT WAS KIND OF LIKE PAINTING BY THE NUMBERS. YOU’RE JUST PAINTING WITH LIGHTS, WITH THE FLASH, OR EVEN FLASHLIGHTS. YOU COULD ACTUALLY DO, YOU KNOW, SQUIGGLES AND WRITE WORDS WITH THE FLASHLIGHT AND WHAT IT WAS SHOWING ON PLACES. >> WOW. >> SO YOU THEN CLOSE THE SHUTTER AND SEE WHAT SHOWED UP ON THE SCREEN, SEE WHAT YOU GOT, BECAUSE YOU COULDN’T TELL-- THERE WAS FLASH AND LIGHTS MOVING ALL AROUND DURING THE PICTURE. AND THEN YOU LOOK TO SEE WHAT IT ALL AMALGAMATED TO AT THE END. IT WAS REALLY NEAT. >> THAT’S AMAZING. WOW. I GUESS-- WHAT WAS IT LIKE SEEING THE SUN FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER BEING THERE FOR SO LONG? >> IT WAS REALLY BRIGHT. AND I WAS IN THE CAVE WITH THOMAS PESQUET AND TIM PEAKE. AND WHEN WE CAME OUT, THOMAS WAS LIKE, “THE SKY IS A DIFFERENT BLUE. THEY CHANGED THE BLUE!” IT WAS JUST SO VIBRANT. AND THE OTHER THING THAT WAS SO AMAZING WAS THAT, YOU KNOW, THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS AND SMELLS IN THE CAVE ARE ALL VERY-- YOU KNOW, VERY MUCH THE SAME. AND WE CAME OUT AFTER THAT WEEK, AND LITERALLY, YOU COULD SMELL EVERY BUSH, AND THE DIRT, AND THE GRASS. I MEAN, IT WAS JUST SHOCKING, JUST SO SENSORY OVERLOAD WITH YOUR SMELL. >> YEAH, BECAUSE I GUESS YOUR BODY ADAPTED TO NOT-- >> TO NOT HAVING IT. >> YEAH. >> AND SO VERY MUCH LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU HEAR PEOPLE COMING BACK FROM SPACE STATION, WHERE YOU DON’T HAVE THE FRESH SMELLS, OR THE BREEZE FROM THE WIND THAT MODULATES. YOU HAVE THE CONSTANT BREEZE OF THE AIR DUCTS AND THE VENTILATION SYSTEM. AND CERTAINLY THE SMELLS ARE PRETTY STANDARD UP THERE. AND YOU COME BACK AND YOU JUST-- YOU KNOW, FEELING THE GRASS UNDER YOUR TOES, AND THIS AND THAT. I MEAN, WE’RE SUPPOSED TO BE LANDING IN DECEMBER. I’M LIKE-- SMELL-- I’M SURE SNOW WILL HAVE A SMELL WHEN I COME BACK, LIKE, “THAT’S FRESH SNOW! THAT’S AWESOME.” [ LAUGHTER ] >> OKAY, SO WE HAVE LIKE ONE MORE MINUTE, BUT I DID WANT TO ASK, I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ABOUT THE AQUANAUT EXPERIENCE, WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO LIVE UNDERWATER. >> THAT WAS AMAZING, TOO, BECAUSE I’VE BEEN SCUBA DIVING FOR YEARS, AND JUST LOVED HOW UNIQUE THAT ENVIRONMENT IS, THE WILDLIFE UNDERNEATH THERE. AND THE AQUARIUS HABITAT RIGHT NOW IS THE ONLY THING ON THE PLANET WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO LIVE UNDERWATER. >> WOW. >> THERE’S ACTUALLY BEEN LESS AQUANAUTS-- PEOPLE THAT’VE SPENT MORE THAN 24 HOURS UNDERWATER-- THAN THERE HAVE BEEN ASTRONAUTS. >> OH! >> AND SO THAT’S A PRETTY INTERESTING FACT. >> YEAH. >> AND THE INTERESTING THING LIKE THAT IS, AGAIN LIKE THE CAVES, THERE IS AN APPARENT FEAR OF DEATH. I MEAN, YOU’VE GOT-- YOU’RE 40 FEET UNDERWATER, BUT ONCE YOU’RE SATURATED, THAT’S NOT SAFETY. SOMETHING GOES WRONG WITH YOUR EQUIPMENT, YOU CAN’T JUST DO AN EMERGENCY ASCENT. GOING TO THE SURFACE WILL KILL YOU. >> YEAH. >> YOU HAVE TO GET BACK INSIDE, AND WE HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, USE THE HABITAT AS A HYPERBARIC CHAMBER. >> WOW. >> AND SO YOU ARE-- YOU’VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT’S GOING ON. AND SO BUDDY CHECKS, CHECKING YOUR GEAR, JUST LIKE WE DO ON SPACEWALK, VERY IMPORTANT. KNOWING WHERE YOUR BUDDY IS AND WHAT HE’S DOING, IN CASE YOU HAVE A PROBLEM THAT YOU CAN GO OVER SOMEWHERE AND BUDDY BREATHE. THINGS LIKE THAT THAT, YOU KNOW, HAVE TO BE IN YOUR MIND THE WHOLE TIME YOU’RE DOING A SIMULATED SPACEWALK UNDERGROUND. AND THEN BE ABLE TO LIVE UNDERWATER AND SEE THE CYCLES OF THE FISH, AND WHAT FISH WERE ACTIVE AT DAYLIGHT, WHAT FISH WERE ACTIVE AT NIGHTTIME, YOU KNOW. AND JUST SEEING THAT WHOLE THING UNFOLD AROUND YOU EVERY DAY JUST MADE IT A REALLY AMAZING EXPERIENCE. AND YOU’RE IN THIS HABITAT THAT’S THE SIZE OF LIKE A SCHOOL BUS-- THERE’S SIX OF YOU LIVING AND WORKING FOR A WEEK! AND YOU’VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET OVER ANY INDIVIDUAL ISSUES YOU MIGHT HAVE, AND BE ABLE TO BE AN EFFECTIVE MEMBER OF THE TEAM. AND BETWEEN THOSE DIFFERENT EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS, THE HOPE IS THAT WHEN SOMEONE FINALLY GETS THE CHANCE TO GO TO SPACE, THAT IT’S JUST ONE OF MANY EXTREME ENVIRONMENT THINGS THAT THEY CAN ADD TO THEIR REPERTOIRE. IT’S NOT SUCH A HUGE, OVERALL ASSAULT ON THEIR SENSES AND THEIR PHYSICAL BEING BECAUSE THEY’VE BEEN IN EXTREME PLACES BEFORE. THIS IS JUST ONE MORE, RATHER THAN THE FIRST ONE THEY SEE. >> YEAH, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU’RE TAKING LITTLE THINGS FROM EACH EXPERIENCE. YOU KNOW, FROM THE CAVENAUT, YOU’RE TAKING ADJUSTING YOUR BIOLOGICAL CLOCK. FROM AQUANAUT, YOU’RE TAKING, YOU KNOW, THE COMRADERY AND BUDDY CHECKS, MAKING SURE EVERYONE’S OKAY. OBVIOUSLY THERE’S GOT TO BE MORE, BUT JUST THAT WHOLE ROUND EXPERIENCE MAKE YOU LIKE TRULY A NAUT. I DON’T KNOW, AN ALL-NAUT? I’M MAKING UP WORDS HERE. ANYWAY, WELL, KOMRADE, THANK YOU FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. I KNOW YOU’RE A VERY BUSY MAN. SO JUST BEST OF LUCK TO YOUR MISSION. MAYBE BY THE TIME THIS IS UP HERE YOU’LL ALREADY BE UP THERE, SO AGAIN, BEST OF LUCK TO YOU.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 128, \"Space Radiation.\" I'm Gary Jordan. I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. This is the final part in our six-part series on the Human Research Program. We've gone into the weeds on every element of the program, and I hope you've enjoyed it. So today, we're going to focus on space radiation. If you're familiar with the podcast, you know that we've visited this topic a few times in the past. Episodes 57, 64, and 75, for those interested. We'll readdress some of those topics today as a refresher, but today, we're going to investigate specifically what happens to the human body when exposed to radiation -- a huge consideration when traveling beyond low-Earth orbit, where the Earth itself does a decent job of protecting space travelers. Outside of the Earth's protection, though, space radiation is a big consideration for human spaceflight, both for the human and for the vehicle itself. This element of Human Research Program focuses on modeling what can happen to the human body in these higher-radiation environments, to help understand the risks and possible mitigations for deep space travel. So, going into the details of this final element is Jason Weeks, Element Manager, and Dr. Steve Platts, acting Element Scientist and Deputy Chief Scientist of the Human Research Program. So, here we go. What we're doing now to help understand space radiation and its effects on the human body. Enjoy.   [ Music ]  Host: Jason and Steve, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today. Really appreciate you coming on.  Steve Platts: Hey, you're welcome.  Jason Weeks: Yeah, I'm glad to be here.  Host: So today, we're going to talk about space radiation. This is the last in our series for Human Research, and honestly, I think it's one of the more interesting. And I say that a little bit selfishly, because here on the podcast, we've done already three episodes on radiation, but I still want to dive deeper. So, this is going to be awesome. This is all about Human Research Program, the space radiation element of that. So, give us a little bit of background on what we're going to be talking about today. How does space radiation affect the human body? Why are we focusing on this?  Steve Platts: There are a number of things that space radiation can do. So, if we think about cancer, that's obvious. You know, a lot of people will make that connection between increased radiation exposure and cancer. Now, we're not talking about the kinds of things that some people have seen on some of the science fiction movies. You know, we're not talking Creature from the Black Lagoon, and no, we're not turning anyone into a banana or anything like some of the discussion went with some of the other genetic studies, but it could potentially increase the risk of getting cancer down the road, and that's one of the things we want to investigate. Are we increasing that risk for the astronauts? Other things can be affected, too -- the brain, and how that happens is a collaboration between us and one of the other elements here at JSC. And then, finally, the cardiovascular system -- it's known that the cardiovascular system is sensitive to some of the products that radiation produces in the tissues. So reactive oxygen species can lead to inflammation. We know that that's bad for the heart, and so, one of the risks that we're working on is the risk of cardiovascular disease due to spaceflight.  Host: So, Steve, tell me about your background. Just, you know, how'd you end up in this role? What's your background, and what are you studying? And what's particularly interesting about the space radiation?  Steve Platts: Yeah, it's funny you ask that, because I just ended with cardiovascular, and I'm actually a cardiovascular physiologist by training.  Host: Alright.  Steve Platts: I went to Texas A&M for my Ph.D., and then the University of Virginia for my research fellowship. And then, after my research fellowship, I was looking for a job, and there was an advertisement at experimental biology. I went to the job fair, because my grant at the University of Virginia was running out, and they said they needed a vascular physiologist at NASA. So, I'm like, huh, NASA. That sounds kind of interesting. So, I checked it out, and I applied for the job, and I got the job. So, I started out by running the cardiovascular laboratory here at Johnson Space Center, and then, over the years, I've kind of moved out of the \"doing the research\" phase to the \"managing the research\" phase. So, I currently serve as the deputy chief scientist for the Human Research Program, and relevant to this podcast, is I'm the acting element scientist for space radiation. So, the element scientist left some time ago, and the element needed some science input and guidance. And so, I've been put in this position to help Jason out, and to help the team out for, you know, strategic thinking, and, you know, what's the science, and help lead the other scientists in the group. So that's the role I'm playing here.  Host: Which is super-valuable, so, yeah, that's awesome. Jason, what about you, your background?  Jason Weeks: So, I'm not a scientist by training, never claimed to be. I've got a lot of experience in different things across NASA that came -- you know, that's helped me come to this job, and I think do a good job. So, I started off as a management analyst within the chief financial offices and moved from there to be the chief of staff for systems engineering and integration within the Constellation Program. And we were doing a horizontal and vertical integration across the program, and I moved over to the docking system, where I helped with project management, and dabbled in advanced technology, nanotechnology for structural engineering.  Host: Wow. Very technical management and leadership there. So, there's a lot to -- there's a lot of different disciplines to pull from, but it's really all about the management part of things.  Jason Weeks: Correct, yes.  Steve Platts: And he's being modest. He just talked about some of his work. He didn't tell you he has two master's degrees.  Host: Alright.  Steve Platts: And so, he is well-versed on all things NASA. So --  Host: Well, tell me about what it takes to run something like this, then, this element of human research. How is this different from some of the other things that you've done before?  Jason Weeks: So, going from an engineering perspective, you are building a widget, and you get a X amount of budget. You get X amount of schedule. Here, you can't do research on a fixed schedule. You can't do science, and say, \"I'm going to have a breakthrough in 4.2 years, and that's going to lead to X, that's going to lead to Y, to Z.\"  Host: That'd be nice.  Jason Weeks: It would be nice.  Steve Platts: -- you can say that. It's not going to happen [laughter], but you can say it.  Jason Weeks: It would be nice. So that was the biggest challenge, was to move from a -- like a Gantt chart philosophy to a science philosophy, and I'm surrounded by wonderful, great people that make my job a lot easier than it probably seems sometimes, just for the fact that we're able to all work together. Like, you know, Steve and I are complementary in the approach that we take to help mitigate.  Host: Yeah, definitely for the space radiation element, but I know you being the deputy chief science for HRP -- and we talked about this a bunch of times on just some of the previous human research episodes. This level of integration -- you talked about working with teams, but the integration not only with space radiation, but how is space radiation playing -- playing its role in other elements, in other parts of --  Steve Platts: That's a great point to bring up, because it's something that we're pushing hard on right now, harder than ever, that integration. So, we've talked about -- and this happens at universities. It happens in industry. You end up with these silos, and so, you have groups who kind of guard their turf, and have their territory, and have their budget. And they're all separate, and that has happened here at NASA, where we have different elements want to do their thing, and, you know, just kind of keep everything else at arm's distance. What we've been working on for the past few years, and we're getting pretty good at, is breaking down those silos, and integrating more. For example, I mentioned that radiation can have an effect on the central nervous system, or the brain. And so, all of the work being done on that now is in collaboration with human factors and behavioral performance element. And so, they're concerned with how the brain's working. We're concerned with how the brain's being affected, and so, we're working together to try and answer that question. What's going on in space? Now, we're doing the same thing with human health countermeasures. And so, the cardiovascular system -- you know, you can think -- well, why are radiation people studying the cardiovascular system? Well, we're studying the radiation effects on the cardiovascular system. HHC studies the cardiovascular system, so we're working together to make sure we're addressing it from all the right angles. How are we looking at things? We look at things a little differently, but we do complement each other. So that's a new collaboration, where that risk has just been put together, and we're working very closely with the folks over in HHC to make sure that that risk gets addressed in all the right ways, with all the right eyes, with all the right experiments to get the best outcome possible.  Host: Now, you had to start somewhere, right? Because when you were thinking about radiation and all of these different things that it can affect -- but obviously, that didn't just come out of nowhere. Like, oh, we need to be looking at this. There has to be some history, so what's some of the background with this particular element, with space radiation? What have we done in the past, when it comes to studying effects of radiation, and how it affects the human body?  Steve Platts: You want to start that, Jason?  Jason Weeks: Yeah. So, as we -- as we started, we didn't have the benefit of ISS. Right? So, we -- you know, as ISS come onboard, we were able to start looking at -- you know, looking at radiation from -- you know, from that -- from the person there. We started doing, you know, dosimetry there. You know, as we know -- we spoke about -- you know, the astronauts are similar in that they're like a -- you know, the radiation technologist or nuclear engineer worker. They have dosimeters on when they're on ISS, and they sort of monitor the environment. The SRAG people -- the space radiation analysis group -- they work on detectors to understand the exposure. And as we moved along, we started to research, you know, for our perspective, chromosome aberrations, you know, the DNA damage to the astronauts onboard space station, the -- what happens to food and pharmacology as it's on ISS. You know, these different things we're researching to try to find out, and we're using that on -- now we're going to use NSRL to be able to test countermeasures, you know. So -- and then we -- you know, we think about -- our long-term goal is ISS, Moon, Mars, and so, we use ISS as a test bed. But it's within the Earth's magnetosphere, so you're not going to get a true GCR environment on ISS.  Steve Platts: They're protected.  Jason Weeks: Yeah, so for, like, a single mission, right, we think about -- a person stays on there for six months. They get about 1/10th of the mission exposure of a Mars mission. And so, as you get more -- as you stay longer, these year missions, they get in a -- they're having dose rate within them that, after a year, gets to about -- be about a third of what a Mars mission would be.  Host: Yeah.  Jason Weeks: And so, you start to add -- you know, added it.  Steve Platts: Yeah, the idea with radiation -- so just real quick --  Host: Yeah.  Steve Platts: -- imagine you're out in the sun, and so, you go out in the sun for 10 minutes, and then you come back in, especially here in Texas. You know, not too bad. You're OK. You go out in the sun for an hour with no sunscreen or anything, and what's going to happen? Right? You're going to get a burn, or you're going to feel some effects. And so, that's from UV radiation, but, you know, the ionizing radiation that we're talking about isn't all that different. So, it's exposure, and so, Jason was saying -- talking about dose, and dose rate. Those are really what determine the effects that's going on. If you get a very short exposure of a very low dose, you know, your body's going to be able to deal with that right away, but if -- it's when you get these longer exposures, longer time and higher doses. Like he said, Mars is 10 times the dose that the current astronauts get on the space station. So, you can understand where -- gee, that's more than what we've studied. And so, we've done a lot of research initially on what is the effect for shuttle-duration missions, and then, with the station -- OK, we're doing a lot of research on shuttle -- station-duration missions, so six months or so. Ah, but now, we're talking about going to Mars -- three-plus years, and no magnetosphere to protect you. You're beyond the Van Allen belt. You're going to get exposed to different things. Jason mentioned GCR, which is galactic cosmic radiation. So that's much more complex than if you're just getting an x-ray, or if you're having exposure from gamma radiation or something. And so, it's complex. It's complicated, and it can do more damage than the types of radiation that you might normally be exposed to here on Earth. So, it's not just more radiation, or a longer exposure. It's also different kinds of radiation, right?  Host: That explains why you were mentioning the space station when you talk about space radiation. You can't just use radiation models on the ground. There's this specific type, this galactic cosmic ray that you're talking about, so you have to build -- you have to collect data. You said you're using dosimeters, just kind of measuring the environment. It seems like you're investigating multiple different areas of that, just the environment itself. A you said its effect on people and its effect on food, but really, you need -- it sounds like you need that space environment to truly get the data for these specific ones, these galactic cosmic rays.  Steve Platts: Yeah, and that's a great point.  Jason Weeks: Yeah, and part of what Steve and Dr. Fogarty talk about is, you know, you're going to experience the thing as a whole body. You're not going to experience the -- you know, the GCR in the brain, and that's it. You're not going to experience isolation and confinement. You're not going to experience this. You're going to experience all of these stresses at the same time, and so, you know, what are they going to -- what are they experiencing? And so, you know, from -- as you learn more -- as we learn more on the ground, we learn more on ISS, you know, there's a couple of things we look at -- are is space radiation -- is it additive? You know, does it -- the radiation add to -- add onto microgravity or altered gravity? Is it -- does it have synergistic responses? You know, is it synergistic in the radiation can cause even larger effects with either one or two of them alone, or combined? Or is it antagonistic, to where they may actually cause -- you see kind of a decrease, because the way they're working? So, these are the things -- as we learn more, we're able to better understand what we're going to face on a three-year mission. It's not like a six-month or one-year. I mean, these guys are going to be gone for three years.  Host: Yeah. And that's -- I'm getting a better feel for understanding not only is it just the -- I was, you know, trying to think -- maybe it's exclusively the galactic cosmic ray, but you used the word \"synergistic.\" It's all of these different factors. It's a number of different stressors, because that is the reality of spaceflight. The reality is that you're going to get blasted from all different areas, and you have all these different areas. Steve, you mentioned before this integration with all these different components of human research, thinking about the human health countermeasures, thinking about the human performance, these -- all these different elements, and understanding the totality of the stressors on the human body sounds important to that.  Steve Platts: Yeah, we like to think of it more as the environment of spaceflight. In kind of the older days, we used to think about it as microgravity. So, we would talk about the microgravity environment, but that's not really just it. It's the whole environment of spaceflight. So that includes microgravity. That includes space radiation. That includes isolation and confinement. That has a big psychological stress, and that psychological stress gets converted by the body into a stress response. And if you look at the mechanisms for that stress response, they're very similar to the mechanisms that we see from radiation, or from microgravity. So, we have this idea of potentially a common pathway. So, is there a pathway by which all the different effects or many of the effects of spaceflight kind of come together into a bottleneck, and then cause the responses that we see? And if there is, that's a great place for us to do research. Because we can get more bang for our buck by researching within that pathway. So that's a field of research we're working on right now. Is there a common pathway? And if there is, what is it? Now, some of us, you know, think we might have an idea what might be going on, but, you know, it's just a hypothesis. And so, we're working on that research right now.  Host: There you go.  Steve Platts: So that's a pretty exciting part, is getting all those things together -- like you were talking about the integration -- getting lots of different people thinking about the same thing from a slightly different viewpoint, and then how can we solve those issues. Because our goal, really, is all the same. We want to keep the astronauts as healthy as possible. We want to keep them safe. We want to come up with countermeasures that can treat any issues they have, and we also want to figure out what potential issues there are so that we can prevent them. And so, it's a -- it's more holistic medical approach to the astronauts. It's not just treating issues. It's preventing issues. So, it's preventative medicine, and those kind of things, and we work with the medical folks quite a bit, too, along those lines.  Jason Weeks: And just to be clear, there are two types of radiation. We talk GCR because that's, you know, the big -- that's the -- you know, the heavy -- you know, the heavy penetrating protons, but we also have solar particle events. And so, they're from -- you know, they're from --  Steve Platts: So, sun flares.  Host: -- yeah  Jason Weeks: sun flares, and they act in a -- you know, in a ying and a yang effect, where the solar particle events, when you're in a -- in the high part of it, the GCR is low. And when the solar particle event cycle is low, GCR's going to be high. So, you use that when you're doing the mission planning. You want to go and do the worst -- you know, the worst of it during the solar max, because then GCR's going to be less.  Host: That's right, but there's -- there can be events, I guess, solar events, like a solar flare that could cause even more issues, right?  Jason Weeks: And that's where we spoke earlier with the space radiation analysis group. They're kind of like the sister organization to us. They're looking at the operations on ISS right now, and they're doing a lot of space weather forecasting to where they've got it down pretty well, to where there may be one or two events that might pop out. But they -- you know, for the most part, they understand what's coming, and they're getting better and better at understanding what that is.  Host: So, tell me about the full scope of space radiation, Jason, the way that -- you know, we have this element of human research, and we're focusing on space radiation, how it affects the human body. What is the scope? What are the things that are important to you? Where are you putting your resources, in terms of studying in these places and working with these researchers, and the full scope of what you're doing?  Jason Weeks: So, the good thing about us is we touch a plethora of universities all across the U.S. We also partner with -- we couldn't be where we are today without the terrestrial research. We have -- you know, we work with [National Institutes of Health] NIH. We work with the [Food and Drug administration] FDA. We're working with National Cancer Institute, and, you know, we use all of this information as the body of knowledge grows to go into -- we take that data and apply -- you know, try to get -- do mitigation, and testing within -- at the NSRL, to where we can use that. Because not everything terrestrially will go to space and work 100 percent like it does on Earth, so we have to take -- this works, and we can repurpose this to go to NSRL and test it. Does the mitigator work the same within a GCR environment as it would on Earth? If it does, that's great. We can do more testing, and we can -- you know, we can move up. We use an FDA animal rule, to where we can't just go and irradiate a human. You know, that's not --  Steve Platts: Yeah, the [Institutional Review Board] IRB frowns on that [laughter].  Jason Weeks: -- yeah, that's looked down upon, right?  Host: Yeah. Right.  Jason Weeks: So, we have to take an approach to where we can ultimately translate between rodents, and -- or whatever to humans, to where we can give them the best chance to thrive in this space environment.  Steve Platts: Hey, can you give the listeners a little more information on NSRL, and what that means?  Host: I was just about to ask, yeah, yeah.  Jason Weeks: Yes, I'll go through the little spiel real quick. So NSRL was commissioned in 2003. It's a joint -- we fund the operations, and it's managed by the Brookhaven Lab for Department of Energy in Brookhaven, New York. Let's see -- operates about 1200 hours a year. We have three runs -- a spring, summer, and fall, and what we did back -- back several years ago, as the lander went to Mars, we were able to get the data from the dosimeter there, and understand what that environment was, what the actual environment from the Earth to the Mars looks like, based on that dosimeter. And the team at NSRL started working on how do I go from just doing an individual ion, which is usually what happens pretty much around the world -- I can go to Chiba and do an experiment, and I can get a proton, or a helium, or an ion. But we know that's not the environment. We've got a lot of good information from 30, 40 years of research, but we understand we're going to galactic cosmic radiation. So, we started working on a GCR sim, and 18 -- summer of '18 was the first time we did a run using a galactic cosmic radiation simulator. So, what that does -- we're able to run back-to-back-to-back 33 ions within 90 minutes. So, we're able to create or simulate the GCR environment on Earth. And it's the only place on Earth that can be -- this can be done. So, it's the next step. It really is an evolutionary step to go from a single ion to 30 -- you know, 33, 30 -- you know, 32, 33 ions. You're essentially getting the periodic table through a 90-minute -- to where we can look at what happens with a chronic exposure. That's what we're looking at. We're not looking at a six-month or a year. We're looking at a chronic exposure. What does that do to the body? So, it really is cutting-edge.     Steve Platts: Yeah, and to follow up on that, think about what events we have here on Earth that we can use to simulate, or at least to model spaceflight radiation. So, a lot of the information that we have is from Hiroshima -- so atomic bomb survivors, right? That was a one-time event radiation exposure. We have nuclear workers. We have all these other things, and those go into models. We have animal work. Those go into models, but you can't -- as we were joking earlier, you can't radiate a human. However, if you have humans who are being treated with radiation for cancer, you are essentially irradiating a human. And if we can get them to volunteer for research studies, then we can get something out of a bad situation. And so, we have two of those studies going on right now at MD Anderson Cancer Center. We have a study looking at the cardiovascular system, and we have a study looking at the central nervous system. And they're both using cancer patients who are being treated for various cancers in the head, neck, and thorax, and we are looking at how those exposures are affecting the heart and are affecting the brain. So, we're not just using animal models. We're not just using computer modeling. We're doing the best we can to get human research in an ethical and safe way, and, you know, we're making big leaps in that category. Jason's mentioned GCR a few times, and we can't emphasize enough how important that is. Because a lot of -- like I said, a lot of our historical research is single-ion, or it's single-exposure. Imagine -- think about exposures, and so, you get something once. And so, the way people have simulated space radiation is they've given the entire dose you get in a mission at one time, in a few minutes, or an hour, or something like that. Now, imagine the difference that your body's going to see if you were to give it a little bit every day, or a little bit every week over the course of a much longer time point. The biological difference is huge, because you have all these internal repair mechanisms that your cells use to repair DNA, and to fix organelles that are not working properly, or to take cells out that are not functioning properly. You know, the average person actually develops cancer many times in their life, but most of the time, your body gets rid of it, right? Your natural immune responses get rid of that cancer cell, or those cancer cells before they ever become an issue. And so, for chronic, which is what our astronauts will see over the course of many years, you know, it's quite different. And so, until recently, we haven't been able to take advantage of that. We've had to use computer modeling to say, \"OK, from a theoretical basis, taking this bolus, or this one-time dose, what do we think is going to happen if we were to spread it out?\" Now we can actually spread it out, and we have another facility at Colorado State that we use, where they can give chronic, low doses, and they have a source. And it just gives off a constant -- well, relatively constant, because you have decay -- dose, and they modify that so that we keep the same dose every day. And then we can get data on long, low exposures, these chronic exposures that are going to be more similar to what we're going to see in a long-duration spaceflight. So, we're getting better and better and better. We're getting more relevant. We're getting more space-like. We're not having to extrapolate as much, and it's just -- it's a very exciting time for us. And we're looking forward to all the things we can do in the future.  Jason Weeks: And see, I think one of the things that Steve hit on was the radiation quality effects, and just for what that is, is -- as we said, we got the 32 -- you know, we got those ions. Not every ion is created equal. And so, what we have to do is look at what that -- we have to make it equivalent. So, what we have is -- we look at an ion, for example, in -- an ion will go through you, and the -- with .5 Gray is what the -- is what goes through your body. But you won't -- you may get a gamma ray, but it won't be the -- it won't feel the same. Because they're weighted different. So, when we look at .5 Gray, we have to look in totality of what are the ions. So, you may feel a .5 Gray ion. You may get a .5 Gray silicon, or a helium, and it feel a lot less. You may get another one, and it's going to feel more. So, we have to take that in -- it's an omnipresent GCR. So, you're going to get it 360 degrees the whole time you're in deep space, and so it -- we have to look at these unique challenges that we're facing.  Host: Yeah. I'm hearing when it comes to trying to -- I mean, the goal here is to have the best understanding of what the space environment is like, and to understand what it's doing to the human body. It sounds like when it comes to researching this, data over long periods of time seems to be a very important thing.  Jason Weeks: Mm-hmm.  Host: These -- you're talking about -- chronic was the word, and then it sounds like making sure that the models, particularly here on the ground, are representative of what is truly out in space, so getting that accuracy -- it sounds like just a lot of data collection [laughter].  Steve Platts: There is, and there has been for quite some time.  Host: Yeah. Yeah, that's a lot of different rays. So, it sounds like when it comes to trying to understand space radiation, there's a lot that has to do with gathering data over long periods of time, this long data collection to understand this -- because that's really, truly representative of what it's like to travel through space. You're going to be there for a long time, and then, Jason, you mentioned this -- trying to best model all of the different parts, these -- you mentioned all of the different ions and making sure that that's representative of what you're actually going to see in space. We have a lot of data collection on the space station, so there's a lot that we can learn there. I know going forward, though, we're talking about this new program called Artemis.  Steve Platts: Mm-hmm.  Host: The Moon is a different radiation environment from low-Earth orbit.  Steve Platts: Yes.  Host: What is it that we are looking forward to doing there?  Steve Platts: So, the Moon is actually much more Mars-like than low-Earth orbit is. So, you will get more galactic cosmic radiation. I think the estimates are it's about half of what we might see when we're going to Mars. So, it's actually a great place to look at radiation. So, our idea has been we're going to use the Moon as an analogue for Mars, just like right now we're using the space station as an analogue for the Moon and for Mars. And so, it's always that forward-looking -- what are we going to be doing next? What do we have to protect for next? And so, one kind of -- it might sound like a crazy idea that we came up with, but I think in the long run, it could be helpful, is having a vivarium on the Moon. Right? Sounds kind of nutty -- like, well, why would we want to do that? But think about this. So, we do a lot of research with animal models. Imagine if we have the animal models on the Moon, getting exposed to the reduced gravity every day, constantly, and then also, if we vary the shielding in this habitat, we could end up with these animal models being exposed to different levels of GCR all at the same time. And then, if we leave them there long enough, that really will be the best simulation of what's going to happen in a trip to and returning from Mars. So, we can get a lot of information out of the lunar exposures to predict what we're going to see in Mars, because we don't want to discover what Mars is going to be like when we get to Mars. We need to know way beforehand, and so, we're going to have to use the Moon as an analogue. And we think we have some ways that we can really do that. It's going to be challenging -- a lot of things we do here at NASA are challenging, but we're confident that we can take advantage of that. And then, obviously, we'll be studying the astronauts, too, and then -- you think more of the phase two of what they've talked about for Artemis is the longer-duration stays on the Moon, and potentially, in the future, a permanent presence on the Moon. If we have those things, we will be there looking at the exposure, not just to keep those astronauts safe, but also, again, looking forward to -- OK, how can we extrapolate this out? How can we use this data and this information to help our astronauts who are going to be going to Mars?    Jason Weeks: And that'll -- and it'll be wonderful -- be able to help us from a modeling perspective, right? We have the models on Earth. We think, you know, we've validated our models on ISS. And so now, we can extrapolate those to the Moon, and then, once we really get to the Moon, we can validate the models. Then we can use that and say, \"OK, we thought it was going to be X. We got to the Moon, and it was Y. Now, let's extrapolate that. Now that we -- because we know the environment of Mars, now what -- now we've validated it to the Moon. What does it say about Mars?\" And so, we'd have enough time in there to understand what we're getting to. Like Steve said, we don't want to get to Mars and realize, oh, wow, there really are black swan things that we could've done on the Moon and ISS to, you know, prevent something.  Host: Yeah. It sounds like -- you know, like I was thinking, Steve, when you were mentioning the Moon, and these types of tests -- I was like, ah, man, that's the ultimate -- that's the ultimate simulation. That's the ultimate model. That would be your Mars data, but from Jason, what you're saying, it's -- you can't just do that one thing. It sounds like you need to cross-reference, and you have all this other available data to make sure that everything is lining up in your predictions for what ultimately will be in Mars. You mentioned dosimeters on Mars, too, so you got that going for you. So there -- you have -- all of these things together gives you the best model.  Jason Weeks: Yep.  Host: Yeah.  Steve Platts: And then, let's not forget about Gateway. So, we're going to --  Host: That's right.  Steve Platts: -- we're going to have dosimetry aboard Gateway as well, helping us look at the exposures there.  Host: And that's going to be orbiting the Moon?  Steve Platts: Yes. Yes, and that's -- even though it's probably only going to be occupied for parts of the year, we can put dosimetry on board that will stay there long-term. So, we can get those long, long exposures, you know, years hopefully, and again, that's more information we have about GCR. If we do experience any solar flares, and we have solar particle events, we'll know that, because we can predict those, but we're not great at the timing for predicting them. And so -- but we know when they happen. And so, we'll be able to tell -- OK, we have this dose, but we know this amount of it is from the solar particle event. The rest of it here is from galactic cosmic radiation, and then we'll have a better feel for that, and then plug that into the computational modeling, the predictive modeling for what Mars then is going to look like. So, we're taking the approach of utilizing every -- every program, every analogue that we can to get to the ultimate goal of getting to Mars.  Host: Kind of sticking with this theme of rounding out all of these types of research to -- with the ultimate goal being Mars, and understanding, and modeling what's happening there, I want to kind of zoom back down to the NSRL. We mentioned it a couple times -- NASA Space Radiation Laboratory. What we're doing there specifically, and who is involved, and what are the things we're looking at in this lab? This -- it sounded particularly interesting, because you mentioned it was the only -- it was the only lab on the Earth that can simulate these galactic cosmic rays and has all of these different ions being thrown at you. So, what exactly is going on in the lab?  Jason Weeks: So, we're doing -- there's a lot of different things going on in lab. So, it's not just us going there, doing that. We have people from Orion going and testing electronics, because once you get past -- you know, once you get past low-Earth orbit, you are going to -- the radiation will play a factor in electronics. So, they go and test the electronics, how that's going to do. They go there and test -- revalidate the dosimeters that they're getting on ISS. They go and validate those. We have space biology that comes in and does testing. We have other agency -- we have Canadian Space Agency come. We have individual universities come and test radiation or ions for plants, for -- you know, whoever wants to come, we can work with that.  Host: Yeah. It's like, how does space radiation affect this thing? How does it affect this thing? How does it affect this thing? Yeah, you can put anything in there.  Jason Weeks: Because, you know -- and the good thing is, with the expansion of all these start-ups -- SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, these other folks that want to go to the Moon -- they want to go to Mars. It builds a mini eco-environment of people who want to get out there and be on the cutting edge of what's going to happen in space. And so, we -- again, we will get data from that that can only help us. The more data can only help us understand what we're going into.   Host: Yeah. So, I mean, thinking about that, it sounds like there's still a lot of data-gathering to fully understand what's going to happen, but things that we need to be careful -- that we can say right now, \"We need to be careful of this when we're on route\" -- let's say Mars, for example. We are on route to Mars. What do we have to be careful of? What do we have to understand what's happening, in terms of the environment of space, and what's happening to the astronauts? You know, how much -- the whole duration of a Mars mission that could be three years-ish, maybe. So, what do we understand now? What are the things we have to look out for?  Steve Platts: Well, we know that the predicted radiation exposure will increase the risk for some cancers, and so, we are working on understanding what those cancers might be. Because as we've talked several times here, galactic cosmic radiation is different than a lot of the radiation exposures you have here on Earth. So, does that difference equate to a different type of cancer that you might get? And again, we're not talking about, you know, the astronauts are on orbit, and, you know, they're getting cancer while they're there. No, that's not what's happening at all. It's their long-term risk of getting cancer is elevated, and that's what we're trying to figure out. And then, what type of cancer would that be? And then, what are some of the countermeasures? We're already doing countermeasure work, and so, we're looking at -- there's a neat study looking at aspirin. And so, it's been shown in the literature that if you give aspirin after an exposure to radiation, you can reduce the risk of certain kinds of cancer by a huge percentage. I believe it was over 40 percent.  Host: Wow.  Steve Platts: And that's massive.  Host: That's significant.  Steve Platts: And so, we're sponsoring studies looking at aspirin. Now, what would that mechanism be? Well, you can just -- without having any data on that, you can imagine, well, what is aspirin used for? It's used as an anti-inflammatory. So, are we talking about that inflammatory issue again, right? And there are other countermeasures we're working on. We're working on potentially soliciting for a whole battery of countermeasures in the near future. So, we're already working on that. We're already working on ways to prevent anything that might happen, and again, prevention is better than treatment. No one wants anything untoward to happen to an astronaut.  Jason Weeks: And again, we're not doing this in a silo. You know, we're working with the terrestrial -- because we -- again, we are going to learn from the MD Anderson. We are going to learn from NIH, FDA, [Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority] BARDA, who -- you know, whichever alphabet soup that we want to add. If they're doing research, we try to keep up with the literature, and use that to understand or grow our body of knowledge.  Host: So, along those lines, we'll sort of wrap up with this. It sounds like what -- based on what we discussed today, there is so much work ahead to help kind of model all these things that we have great ideas, based on what we think we understand, and what we hope to continue research into, to help better understand. What excites you the most about some of the upcoming research with space radiation, and some of the missions coming up for NASA that'll help to kind of flesh out some of these ideas?  Jason Weeks: Go ahead.  Steve Platts: OK, I'll go first. I think the idea of doing the radiation experiments on the Moon to me is the -- I mean, it's incredibly exciting, and allows your imagination to kind of run wild, and just imagine the things you can do when you're actually in the environment. And you're not having to simulate something. It's there. That's GCR. Those are [solar particles event] SPEs that you're getting exposed to -- just the real-world, real-time work that we're going to be able to do when we're in that environment. And then, also, that gives us greater purpose for being there, right? That gives us the idea that we're using that to move forward, to get to Mars. So, for me, personally, the idea of being on the Moon and doing research on the Moon that helps us do further exploration is the most exciting.  Jason Weeks: And see, I do enjoy the idea of doing the whole-body radiation and looking at all different stresses at the same time. For my -- for my side of the equation of the two of us, I would look forward to more working with outside people that are not necessarily inherent to NASA. You know, what is [European Space Agency] ESA doing? Can I work with [Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency] JAXA more on the [Radiation Effects Research Foundation] RERF facility? Can I -- you know, can I work with, you know, the Russians more? Can we build more collaborations? Because, you know, more collaborations to me would -- will help us move the schedule to the left -- go back to schedule -- schedule to the left, and to increase our body of knowledge more. And again, I go back to more knowledge is better.  Host: That is wonderful. Yeah, it's a very exciting time coming up. I definitely appreciate everything we've talked about today for space radiation. It sounds like it's more complicated than maybe I think people think. It sounds very simple -- space radiation -- but there's just so many different elements to this, and getting the best data is super-important. So, to the both of you, Jason and Steve, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today and talking about space radiation.  Steve Platts: Oh, you're welcome.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host):  Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, episode 61, Hostile and Closed Environments.  This is part five of our five-part series on the five hazards of human space flight.  How many times can I say five in a row?  Five times.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  On this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers and astronauts, all to let you know the coolest information about what's going on right here at NASA.  So, today, like I said, is the final chapter in this five-part series.  The Human Journey to Mars is an extremely complex undertaking and challenging hazards such as radiation, isolation confinement, distance from Earth, gravity, and this last one, hostile enclosed environments are being studied using ground-based analogs, laboratories, and of course the International Space Station, right above us.  Today we consider closed and hostile environments with Dr. Brian Crucian, a biological studies and immunology expert at the Johnson Space Center.  Brian serves as the principal investigator for a NASA functional immune study.  According to him, \"the immune system is very complex, and several aspects of immunity remain uninvestigated during space flight.   We now need to delve deeper into the immune system changes that happen in space and determine if these changes during flight elevate clinical risks for astronauts in future deep space missions.\"  We'll also hear clips from my conversation with Dr. Stan Love, NASA astronaut and just a super smart guy.  Love shared his own perspective about living in a hostile and closed environment himself, and some thoughts about what it will take to make a successful deep space mission.  So with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with Dr. Brian Crucian.  Enjoy.    [ Music ]   Host:  Brian, thank you for coming on the podcast today.   Dr. Brian Crucian:  It's a pleasure.   Host: So, this is last in our series of five hazards.  We've talked to a lot of experts on the different hazards of space flights, particularly dealing with the human body, but this last one I think might be one of the more interesting, at least to me, is hostile and closed environments, because how I think of it is, you know, you kind of have to almost invent your own planet or earth, something that's going to contain the human body in a livable space in the not so livable, you know, interplanetary space, and then carry it from one body to another.  It's such an interesting concept.  But you're an expert in immunology, so I think we should kind of start there, is when we're talking about a hostile or closed environment, where does immunology come in?   Dr. Brian Crucian: Humans need a well-functioning immune system to maintain our health, and that means protecting us from pathogens, viruses, bacteria.  On the way home, someone may sneeze on you, and you might catch a rhinovirus or an adenovirus, and you'll have a cold, and you'll be sick for seven days.  And so you need a well-functioning immune system, all these different cells that are in the blood and the lymph nodes to keep you healthy.  But you also need a well-maintained, a well-tuned immune system, and so the immune system can go out whack.  And if it is hyperactive, you might be at risk for things like allergy, asthma.  If it really persists as a problem, you might develop autoimmune diseases.  You also need a healthy immune system to keep you from getting other diseases such as cancer.  One of the functions of the immune system is to keep you from getting cancer.  We have cells in our body called natural killer cells, and they scavenge the body for malignant cells and eliminate them.  And so you need a very well-maintained and properly operating immune system, and when you go into an adverse environment, such as space flight, or there are terrestrial adverse environments, the immune system can become dysregulated, and we say dysregulated, not suppressed, because it can be functioning too little or functioning too much, a little hyperactive, and so we, at NASA we have a variety of assays that we can monitor the immune system of the astronauts and see how well their immune system is functioning during space flight.   Host: So what do we know right now?  Let's just, let's go to the International Space Station.  What's happening to the immune system up there right now.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, if you don't mind, I'll back up a little bit before that.   Host: Oh, please.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And so, as immunologists, our community, and this is immunologists in Europe, Canada, Japan, Russia.  Our community has been very interested in what happens to people during space flight because we all want to get ready for those exploration missions, those deep space missions.  And so when we head the space shuttle, all right, you could get a sample, a blood sample or a saliva sample from someone, look at their immune system after space flight.  And if you get a sample from someone after space flight, what you're really looking at are the stresses of landing.  Landing is scary.  Re-adaptation after a prolonged deconditioning is a stressor, and so you're really looking at those stressors.  And so we needed the International Space Station to come along to give us two things.  We need long duration space flight, all right, because if you look at people during short duration space flight, you're looking at the sprint.  We want to look at the marathon because that's more like a Mars mission or a prolonged lunar mission, right.  And we also need the ability to sample them and return those samples during that long duration space flight.  And so we needed the advent of this national laboratory to afford us the ability to look at what happens to people during long duration orbital flight.   And in this situation, we're using orbital space flight as an analog or model for those exploration missions.  We have other analogs or models we use on Earth as representative space flight, for example, Antarctic winter over or undersea missions.   Host: Okay.  All right.  Do they all give us different and relevant data points that help us understand deep space flight, then?   Dr. Brian Crucian: Yes, we are learning through a variety of flight studies that have been happening on board the International Space Station.  We're learning what happens to the immune system during long duration space flight, all right, and there is an early adaptation phase, which is say the first 45 days where you're adjusting to the environment and getting used to those new stressors, this hostile environment, and then you settle out into what we call space normal.  And so we're really more interested in sampling people on say the back half of their six-month mission so we can see what their immune system and other physiological systems also, what they have settled out to be for space normal.  We think that's more reflective of what might be happening during say a mission that would take several years to Mars.  This will allow us to think about countermeasures for this phenomenon.  Design those countermeasures while we have ISS, maybe validate those countermeasures so we can keep astronauts safe during those deep space exploration missions.   Host: So what do we know about the state of the astronauts at the end of their six-month increments.  What state is the immune system in?   Dr. Brian Crucian: So the immune system is very complicated.  It's one of the most complicated systems in the body.  You have many different types of cells.  Lymphocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, and they all have distinct function.  Some of these are comprised of what we call innate immunity that functions immediately.  If you say puncture your skin, those cells go to work immediately, and they're nonspecific.  They want to eat those bacteria and heal that wound and protect you.  You also have other types of cells that are what we call pathogen specific.  If you get that virus on the way home, you get that adenovirus or that rhinovirus, you need virus-specific immunity.  And so that takes about a week to generate and eliminate that pathogen, but that stays with you for the rest of your life, and you have memory to that particular virus.  You never get the same cold virus twice.  And so when we look at astronauts during space flight, we have to look at all these different aspects of their immune system to answer that simple question.  What's happening to innate immunity.  What's happening to adaptive immunity.  The B cells make antibodies.   The T cells control viruses.  The natural killer cells help keep us from getting cancer, and so it's a complicated question, and we're still looking at some of these aspects.  What we have looked at very well have been molecules called cytokines in the blood plasma of astronauts, the molecules that regulate immunity, and we can look at them over the course of a mission and see what type of dysregulation, what type of inflammation we have.  We've looked at certain types of cells, cells that control latent herpes virus reactivation, and we see those don't work as well.  That leads to the reactivation of certain types of viruses in astronauts.  And so we're characterizing this phenomenon in astronauts.  They're not sick at all.  I mean they're working hard and enjoying their missions, but these are subclinical phenomenon that make us a little bit worried about what might happen on a Mars mission that would take several years where you're going to increase the radiation, and you have no rapid return option.   [sound effect]  Host: So next I ask about things growing on the space station, but before we get into that, Stan Love gave his own insight into things growing in the space environment and how that relates to planetary protection.   [sound effect]  Stan Love:  So the microbes that are in your environment are the ones that you bring with you largely.  Microbes have a very fast turnover rate, so they could evolve a little bit, change a little bit while you're in space, but not a lot.  I think they have isolated new microbes on the space station.  The space station has been up there for ten years, so it's had time.  But planetary protection is actually something we need to pay pretty close attention to.  The moon is probably as dead as a doornail.  It has had no atmosphere for four and a half billion years.  It gets irradiated by the sun, the ultraviolet light, the solar wind, the cosmic rays.  There's no water.  The temperatures in the daytime are over-boiling.  The temperatures are night are 200 degrees below zero, and we're pretty sure, and we've got the samples back from [inaudible], of course, and we've looked through them, and we have found nothing alive.  We did find some spores on a TV camera, on a probe we sent to the moon, and then later the astronauts landed next to that probe and brought home the TV camera lens to study how it had changed in ten years, and they found some viable microbe spores that had not yet been killed, but those guys were not growing and multiplying.   Yeah, microbes are tough.   Host:  Wow.   Stan Love:   So with that in mind, microbes are very tough, when we talk about Mars, now that's got an atmosphere.  The daytime highs are not as hot.  The nights are cold, but the nights are cold in Antarctica, and there are algae living inside rocks in Antarctica that can only photosynthesize during the summer when the sun comes out.  So life is pretty tough, and there might be microbes on Mars that when they got into a nice, warm, moist, happy Earth environment would go berserk and destroy our lives here.   Host: That would stink.   Stan Love:   Okay, the odds are low, but the risk is terrible.  Have you ever seen the movie, The Andromeda Strain, it gives you a hint of what could possibly happen.  That one came back from Venus, and I'm not worried about Venus.  Venus is probably really sterile.   Host: It's pretty hot there.   Stan Love:   It's really dang hot, yeah.   [sound effect]  Host: Yeah.  Would then, it would be something that would develop internally or would it be something maybe from the environment.  Because just from having conversations with some of the experts in the past, it seems like there's, you know, fungus and just stuff growing in the space station.  Is that something that's a concern from an immunology perspective?   Dr. Brian Crucian: So that's a great question, and what you're basically asking is what causes it.   Host: Yeah, yeah.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And so that's a complicated answer as well.   Host: Hum.   Dr. Brian Crucian: You have humans in space is what we called an applied experiment, meaning if I'm doing an experiment in my laboratory, I'm controlling one variable.  I want to see if a certain diet or radiation or microgravity causes an effect.  When I put humans in space, they're subjected to a whole bunch of variables, and I can't stop that from happening.  So they're experiencing stress, microgravity, radiation, alter circadian rhythms.  They see a sun rise and a sun set every 90 minutes.  Isolation and a confinement.  And so what we're really talking about is not the effect of microgravity but the effect of space flight on these people.  And space flight is defined as all these variables.  So all of these variables create a synergy, and they affect the human body adversely, and we see effects on bone, muscle, fluid shifts, the immune system, and so collectively, we at JSC and around the world, these scientists are trying to characterize these phenomenon so we can develop counter measures.   Host: Hum.  So what do we know about counter measures that we, do we have counter measures right now?  What are we doing to, based on what we know and recognize, are there things that we have in place that can sort of help protect the immune system on board.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, that's another big question.  We can probably spend an hour talking about counter measures--   Host: Hey, we have an hour.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And I'll try and keep it to the 50,000 foot level.  And so, yes, we have counter measures that are already in place.  Things that you might not consider a counter measure are in fact a counter measure.  Radiation shielding is a counter measure.  Maintaining a clean spacecraft is a counter measure.  Propulsion is actually a type of counter measure.  If you can get me to Mars in two weeks, a lot of the problems I'm worried about go away.   Host: Oh, yeah.   Dr. Brian Crucian: But what people classically think about is say the pill that you would take as your counter measure.   Host: Right.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And so we, for the immune system, we would look at things like nutrition supplements, probiotics, things that you can take to reduce inflammation and actually medications, pharmacological interventions can influence the immune system.  And so where we stand in my discipline is we're trying to characterize this phenomenon, and we'll defer our selection of countermeasures until we've completed characterization, and there are several European, Russian, and American studies that are working to characterize this phenomenon.  Then we'll sit down with researchers, flight surgeons, practicing clinical immunologists and collectively look at this data and then try and figure out, okay, what will the counter measure be for the immune system.  Other disciplines I'm sure have the same discussion with their experts.  When you've selected your counter measure, then you would probably want to look at that in the ground environment first and validate it, and if there's time, within the life span of ISS, you would want to do an in-flight validation also.   Host: So we have a lot of data on the International Space Station already.  You know, we've been up there for nearly 18 years at this point for continuous human presence, just a lot of people going up and living there, successfully too.  We do things, like you're saying, with counter measures, just wiping down the inside of the space station.  So what do we understand about living in a closed environment so far?  Do we even have to worry about some sort of external, I mean I'm thinking, when I think of immunology, the first thing I think about, like you're saying, is like a common cold.  There's just some sort of virus bacteria, something that can affect, you know, I guess us in every day life, but an astronaut, you know, do we even have to worry about that in a closed environment?   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, the answer is yes, and we learned that early on in the space program.  If you've ever seen the great movie Apollo 13, you know about how a space mission can be affected by clinical disease, either before the mission or during the mission, and in fact, we had several infectious disease events during the Apollo program, and that led to the implementation of the health stabilization program, which is basically your preflight quarantine.  After that was implemented, the rates for infectious disease during space missions went down.  And so that was one of the first operational countermeasures that was really put in place to help keep astronauts healthy during their space missions.  There are other types of operational countermeasures that we're doing today.  We screen, you seem to be asking about environmental concerns, and we screen food that goes up, payloads that go up.  Get a toxicological screen, a microbial screen, and so we're trying our best to keep this environment clean and that will help keep the astronauts safe.   Host: Yeah.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And as we continue to characterize things that happen to physiology during missions on ISS, you'll start to see more discussion of these biomedical counter measures, just something that someone might ingest to supplement or a medication.  But collectively, all of these operational counter measures and counter measures that are ingestible, will be employed on these deep space exploration missions.   Host: For sure.   Dr. Brian Crucian: The cleanest environment, the fastest space ship, the most pristine foods and water that we can get, and this wonderful set of medications to help keep people healthy.   Host: Man, that sounds like a great place to spend some time in space.  Yeah, that's a good vehicle, the one you're describing.   Dr. Brian Crucian: You can set it up.  I'm willing to go with you.  [laughter]   [sound effect]  Host: So that's a great overview of what we know so far about living on the ISS.  Stan Love added a few more details outside of immunology, and there's a lot here, about ten minutes worth of stuff, but stick with me, because it's super interesting and totally worth it.  And we'll get back into the immune system afterwards.   [sound effect]  Host:  Now how about the International Space Station specifically.  What are we learning, what are we learning on there about living in a closed environment, maybe about lights, maybe about air, maybe about stuff like that?   Stan Love:   Well first of all, with the confinement of small volume, space station crews to my knowledge have never complained that there wasn't enough room.  So the space station is good for at least six months, but the space station is really big, and we can't sent it to Mars because it's too big.   Host: Yeah.   Stan Love:   Lighting, lighting on the space station early on tended to be kind of dim, and there was enough light for people to do their work, but it affects your mood, your emotional state, if the lights are too dim all the time.  Getting exposure to sunlight is important for keeping your biological clock running properly, so you feel sleepy at bedtime, you sleep well at night, and then you wake up refreshed in the morning.  That's not a given in space.  We're going to Mars without planet to interpose itself between us and the sun to make night.  It's always going to be full sunlight outside, but there aren't going to be very many windows, so it's going to be artificial lighting inside.  Lighting on the space station has been gradually changing out with brighter lights and lights that you can change to be blueish in the morning, and that helps your biological clock to say, oh, it's morning.  It time to get up and be energetic, and they can actually make them a little bit redder in the evening on the space station.  And that tells your biological clock, oh, the sun is going down.  I should be getting ready to have a meal and go to sleep.   So we've got that capability on the space station now, and I haven't heard anybody complaining about the light.  So I think we've got that.  Food, water, and air are crucial.  We don't last long without those, and for Mars, we cannot take enough fresh water in tanks to keep the crew hydrated for six months, nine months out, a year on the surface of Mars, nine months back.  So we're going to have to recycle our water.  And yes, that's gross.  And my buddy Spanky, who's spent a couple of tours on the space station calls it turning yesterday's coffee into tomorrow's coffee.   Host: I love that.   Stan Love:   So that piece of equipment, first it has to work really well.  If your water starts tasting like pee, you're going to be an unhappy person.   Host: Oh yeah.   Stan Love:   And eventually an unhealthy person.  And if it breaks, you're stuffed, right.   Host: Oh, yeah.   Stan Love:   You are in terrible trouble, and unfortunately this kind of closed life support, you know, where we recycle most of our water, so we can distill clear water out of urine, the stuff left behind is so gross you don't even want to think about it.  It's like dark brown, ammonia, stinking sludge.   Host: Oh, now I'm thinking about it.   Stan Love:   Yeah, oh, so, okay.  So that part we can't recycle, although we're thinking about ways to get even, squeeze even more water out of that, but I hope that works really well because the sludge that it's coming from is not appetizing.  You have to do the same thing with your air.  You inhale, actually most of our air is nitrogen that our bodies don't use.  But you inhale, you burn up some of that oxygen, you exhale some carbon dioxide.  You've got to pull that carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.  Over the years, that's given us a lot of trouble.  We had what we thought were machines that could keep the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere down to a nice low comfortable level, but we're finding out that with six months of exposure, a level of CO2 that you wouldn't even notice, CO2 carbon dioxide, that you wouldn't even notice if you were exposed to it for a day, if you were exposed to it days on end, it starts giving you headaches.  There are mood changes.  People get irritable.  It adjusts the chemistry of your blood if you're breathing a lot of carbon dioxide.  That's what actually triggers your breathing reflex, those changes in the acidity of your blood.   Host: Ooh.   Stan Love:   Good stuff.  And so we're finding that for a long duration, we need to keep the carbon dioxide down at a low, low level where our machines can barely keep the CO2 down there, because you're trying to scrub, you know, if scrubbing carbon dioxide out of air was easy, we wouldn't have any worries about climate change.  Getting carbon dioxide out of air is hard.  It takes a lot of power, complicated machinery, things that absorb carbon dioxide when they're cold, and then you seal those off, open a vent to the outside, heat it up, and drive the CO2 out overboard.  Where now we actually can take the carbon dioxide and water that people are exhaling, you also exhale water vapor that has to be captured from the cabin atmosphere and removed or the humidity gets really high and it gets real sticky and gross inside.  So all that stuff has to work, and we have to try to recycle some of it, and we can actually convert some of that captured oxygen and carbon dioxide back to water and oxygen that we can use.   Host: Nice.   Stan Love:   So that part is good, but then we're dumping methane overboard.  Well we could keep that methane and use it for rocket propellant, if we were very clever about it.  But there's going to be some loss, but we have to recycle and recycle and recycle because we just can't carry all that much raw materials.  And so that equipment becomes crucial.  If it breaks, you're going to die.  They gloss over this quickly in the Martian if you saw that movie or read the book.   Host: Yeah.   Stan Love:   The science is even better in the book.  The movie did a pretty good job.  The book does an excellent job.  He sort of glosses over, yeah, the air recycler has to keep working, and it never broke, so that was good, because he lived.   Host: Right.   Stan Love:   And when you think about space ships, you know, we have satellites that do communications, that take pictures of the Earth.  We have robots that go out to the planets, and we've launched thousands and thousands of these things over the history of space programs.  And all of them have a power system and a computer system and a communication system and structures and thermal control and all these other systems, only a couple have had life support systems.  So we have millions of hours of run time on basic spacecraft mechanical systems.  We don't have as many hours on life support systems.  So this technology is in its infancy compared to most of the things that are on space ships, and hence, they break a lot.  You know, on the space station that's fine.  We have a lot of spare parts on the space station and we can send up more with, you know, six weeks of notice, because we got robot ships going up there all the time.   Host: Yeah.   Stan Love:   On the way to Mars though, nah ah.  You don't have a possibility of resupply.  You can prestage some stuff at Mars, but as we like to darkly, humorously point out, if your life support system breaks halfway to Mars, you have the rest of your life to fix it.  [laughter]   Host: That is pretty dark but pretty funny.   Stan Love:   Yeah, so, but it gets the point across, right.   Host: It does, it does.   Stan Love:   You've got to get this repaired or you're going to die.   Host: Yeah.   Stan Love:   And it must recycle because we cannot bring raw materials.  The one things we can't recycle yet at all is food.  So turn poop into a salad, only the Earth can do that for you.   Host: Ah.   Stan Love:   Okay.  Only the Earth can turn your poop into salad.   Host: Right.   Stan Love:   And I mean an appetizing salad.  So we, a farm needs sunlight.  Sunlight is something like 1000 watts on every square root yard of plants.   Host: Wow.   Stan Love:   And when you figure out how much grow lights that is, no space craft power system can support that.  Even if you made a farm and grew a couple of very selective crops on small areas that was barely enough to feed the crew, plants get sick.  Single species plants get sick easy.  And if a, you know, rust wipes out your wheat crop halfway to Mars, you're out of luck, right.  You got no harvest, you're dead.   Host: Yeah.   Stan Love:   And, you know, this was a problem for humans in antiquity.  We've gotten better at that, you know, with fertilizers and, you know, pest treatments for our crops, but it's tough to re-create a farm in a space craft.  The power, the weight, you could use sunlight, but now you need giant windows, engineers hate little tiny windows because keeping the air pressure inside from blowing the window out to the outside means heavy structures and triple panes of glass, and that gets big and heavy and you can't make a greenhouse.  The same thing on Mars.  It doesn't have enough air pressure to hold your greenhouse down, the internal pressure from normal air is 15 pounds on every square inch of that glass on the greenhouse.  So farms are a long time coming.   Host: Yeah.   Stan Love:   People who study this problem professionally gain a new appreciation for the services that we get from the Earth without paying for them.  These would be very, very expensive if we had to try to reproduce them from scratch.  There was even a long-term experiment that was built and run in Arizona called Biosphere 2, and they built this gigantic greenhouse, and they seeded it with miniature biomes, like a jungle and a coral reef and an ocean and tried to re-create a miniature Earth's environment, totally sealed from the outside, and they put six people in it, and they were going to try to live there for a year or so.  And the results were not good.   Host: Really?   Stan Love:   Okay.  The bees that they had for pollinating all died immediately.  The ants and cockroaches population exploded.  The oxygen in the atmosphere began disappearing.  They had to pump in extra oxygen.   Host: Oh wow.   Stan Love:   To keep the crew from perishing.   Host: Right.   Stan Love:   Strange, horrible chemicals started showing up in the environment that were eventually traced to the body fat of the crew members, you know, from eating, you know, apples that had some pesticides or something on it.  They had this in their body fat, and they lost so much weight that those chemicals were showing up in the environment.   Host: Wow.   Stan Love:   And eventually they had to terminate the experiment, and there were many, many things that were problems with that, not just the technical, the management was difficult as well.  But look it up sometime and think about, okay I have to make a new biosphere too, and if any part of it fails I'm dead.  And, you know--   Host: It gives you a lot of appreciation for the Earth.   Stan Love:   Yes.   Host: Because the Earth does a pretty good job of keeping us alive.   Stan Love:   Earth does an awesome job, and we should not mess with that capability because we are highly invested in it, I like to put it, we are highly invested in the status quo.   Host: Oh yeah.   Stan Love:   So, farms and space are going to be a long time coming.  Appreciate what you got here.   [sound effect]  Host: So that's the environment, and it seems, it seems pretty straightforward, right.  You want a clean space craft, you want a fast space craft, you want one with enough food.  Now what are we doing to make sure that the astronaut’s immune system is strong?  Are there stuff, is there like exercises or something, maybe, I don't know, getting enough sleep is something that really helps with keeping the immune system strong in space.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, what you're really getting into are translational aspects of physiology that can influence the immune system.  And so exercise is important to keep the immune system strong.  If you don't exercise, you will become somewhat immune deficient, and you should exercise to maintain your immune health and other aspects of your body.  Too much exercise though, can have an adverse effect on the immune system.  Marathon runners have a higher incidence of infectious diseases after completing these races, because it's a stressor on the body.  It's like most things in life, there is a sweet spot of activity where you want to be not too much and not too little.   Host: That's right.  That's why I don't run marathons really.  I just don't want to get sick.   Dr. Brian Crucian: I've done three.  It's very challenging.  I'm a middle to the end of the pack kind of guy.   Host: Did you get sick afterwards?   Dr. Brian Crucian: No.   Host: Oh, okay.   Dr. Brian Crucian: But I wouldn't say that I was really physically exerting that much.  [laughter]   Host: Middle to the, oh, I see, I see, yeah.  So was that, is that really a consideration for space flight then, making sure that even if they are exercising, because it does help with the immune system and sleeping enough, that they're not doing so, they're not exerting themselves too much.  Is that a consideration for maintaining immune health?   Dr. Brian Crucian: That's an interesting question.  And NASA and our wonderful exercise experts here have been working this for decades.  Different types of aerobic and resistive exercise devices have been employed on ISS, and we've been looking at their effects on bone loss, muscle loss, and it's getting better is my understanding.  This is not my area of expertise, but certainly all of these exercise counter measures are having a positive effect.  Some crews don't lose that much bone and muscle as compared to early in the space program.   Host: So on top of exercise, you know, we're talking, we're talking sleeping too.  You know, we actually had a conversation, I think it was, oh, gosh, we've had a lot at this point.  I want to say it was with Tom Williams, we talked a little bit about sleep because he did a number of sleep studies, but how sleeping is, I guess, affected to the immune system, and you mentioned a little bit about circadian rhythm too, seeing 16 sunrises and sunsets per day.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Right.  Proper sleep, enough sleep is also very important for maintaining a healthy immune system, and you have a circadian rhythm that helps you sleep well at night, and so cortisol is a stress hormone, levels of cortisol will fluctuate throughout the day.  Your peak cortisol in your blood or saliva is about 30 minutes after waking.  You're up and ready to go.  It tends to trail down for the rest of the day, get you ready.  Your lowest levels are at night before sleep, get you ready for sleep, and so a proper immune system also requires sufficient sleep and also requires a well-maintained circadian rhythm.  What happens in space is they rapidly lose their circadian entrainment, and what we see is sleep medications are probably the most commonly used medication on orbit.   Host: Really?   Dr. Brian Crucian: To help the crews get a proper night sleep.  And so one of the things that is probably contributing to the dysregulation of the immune system we see on orbit is definitely a loss of circadian entrainment in these crews.  We can look at the effects of sleep loss terrestrially, either in a laboratory setting, Steven Chia [phonetic] did a nice study where he looked at the immune system of people that either didn't get enough sleep or that were shifted, one or two hours a day, over the course of a week, to look at just the effect of sleep on the immune system.  We can also look at people doing a winter over in Antarctica.  And so crews spend a year in Antarctica, they spend several months in a period of 24-hour darkness, and so that has a profound effect on their physiology, and we are, along with European collaborators, in particular Dr. Alexander Chokair [phonetic], we are looking at what happens to the immune system in several Antarctic bases.  Antarctica is a mountain, and so some of the interior bases like South Pole Station or Concordia you get these sleep alterations, the circadian loss, this 24-hour darkness, and you also have a persistent hypobaric hypoxia, coastal Antarctic winter over.   You have a normoxic environment, but you also have that extreme environment.  And so, yes, in-flight sleep is important.  It can affect the immune system, and these are the tools we would use to look at this phenomenon on the ground.   Host: Hum, Antarctica, wow.  I mean, if I was going to go to Antarctica, I'd probably choose a 24-hour light.  That would probably make me feel a little bit better.   Dr. Brian Crucian: They have that during the Antarctic summer.   Host: Yeah.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And then when we get to the Antarctic winter, they get the 24-hour darkness.   Host: Right.  I don't know why you'd sign up for the Antarctic winter trip, but how long are they staying there to really get enough data to understand this circadian change?   Dr. Brian Crucian: Crews performing a winter over in Antarctica, at most of the bases, the typical mission duration is about a year.  That makes it a fantastic ground-based space flight analog where we want a prolonged mission duration.  So the year is dictated by the calendar year.  Generally during the summer period in Antarctica, you have resupply of these bases.  Crew swaps happen, and then the last crews leave for the winter over period, and the crews do their one-year duration with the middle of the Antarctic winter being the three months or so of 24-hour darkness.   Host: Hum.  Do we have enough data to understand what's happening to the immune system because of these sleep studies, or is there still a lot that we still need to look into?   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, we have been, if you're asking about Antarctica, yes, we're learning more.  People have been looking at the reactivation of latent herpes viruses, which is a nice biomarker for immune dysregulation in Antarctic winter over and during space flight for decades.  Dr. Duane Pearson at NASA was one of the pioneers for using viral DNA in saliva as a biomarker for immune dysregulation.  But more recently the studies I mentioned with our European collaborators are helping us to really define comprehensively what happens to the immune system during Antarctic winter over.  And so a lot of the same assays that we use to characterize immune changes in astronauts that have happened on ISS, we simply translate those assays to Antarctica and employ them there, and it give us a very nice flight to ground comparison.   Host: Right.   Dr. Brian Crucian: What's interesting is the different ways you have to change things to implement studies in these two different locations.  And so for space flight, it's very difficult to take our laboratory there or get a lot of crew time to do a lot of processing for the sample.  So we'll draw a blood sample.  We'll bring it back to Earth, and we can get an ambient blood sample in our hands in about 37 hours that was collected during space flight.  For Antarctic winter over, you don't have a rapid return for samples like this, and so you have to, you do have the ability to deploy a little more equipment.  And so Concordia station in particular, we deployed flow cytometers, various sample processing apparatus, and we were able to have the crews do a little more remote processing of our samples during their winter over activities.  But we're chasing the same data.  Flight to ground comparison is very important for validating a ground-based analog, which is a nice tool to help you understand what's happening during flight and also a nice location then you can probably use to test your counter measures.   Host: Right.  Yeah.  There's a lot of other, there's a lot of other research going on too that's-- you used the word analog, that's these sort of studies where you're putting them in an environment that's, you know, it's not like you're taking a vacation.  I wouldn't call that a vacation at all, but you're really just putting them in this environment to really understand what it's like in these hostile environments.  Antarctica is one of them, and there's another one called Mars 500 too.  What's happening there?  Are we doing similar studies?   Dr. Brian Crucian: Mars 500 is a very interesting space flight analog that's happening in Russia the Institute for Biomedical Problems in Moscow, and I should probably back up and give you the overview of these different types of analogs and how they work.  And so analogs on the ground are wonderful for doing physiological assessments of people and learning a little bit about space flight without having to go there, but the choice of analog depends really on the system that you're interested in.  And so if I'm interested in bone and muscle loss, we use head down tilt bedrest.  We put people in bed for 90 days, and they don't move.  Well, they move a little bit in the bed, but they don't get up.  They have this hypokinesis.  They don't use their bones and muscles as much.  They are head down tilted, so you get fluid shifts as a great analog.  It's not a great analog for immune dysregulation because a lot of the stressors I mentioned before aren't present in that analog.   Host: Right.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Antarctic winter over would not be a good analog for these bone and muscle scientists because even in Antarctica, you're in a 1G field, and you're carrying things around, and you're ambulatory and you're walking about.  And so you have this whole suite of analogs that differ.  We also have cell culture analogs and animal analogs, a whole host of tools we can use.  Mars 500 is a really nice analog where they've re-created the interior of a space vehicle, and they put people in it for up to 500 days and simulate the entire anticipated duration of a Mars mission including landing day, and then they have them exit the vehicle and do a little simulated planetary exploration in space suits, reenter the vehicle, and so to pretty high fidelity, they re-create a Mars mission and except your lacking the radiation component, the microgravity component, but most other aspects of the flight can be replicated.  They even did communication delays, I believe, to make it more realistic.   And we did have some of our European Russian collaborators do immune assessment on the Mars 500 participants and did see some interesting changes that some aspects of which did look like space flight.  And so there's probably a psychological stress component to what is happening to the immune system also.   Host: Right.  But this is, this is an analog where you don't have, you're not able to play with microgravity because this is happening in Russia.  So you're taking away some of these components that really fully encapsulate what it's like, the space flight environment basically, but you're still getting immune responses just based on being in the environment, the stress of it.  What is, what is, I guess this might be a fundamental question, but what is stressful about being in a closed environment for up to 500 days?   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, you're right in that we cannot in an analog replicate all the factors associated with space flight.   Host: Right, which is why [inaudible].   Dr. Brian Crucian: When I lecture students, I tell them two things in particular.  We can't really put people in a microgravity room.  We don't have something like that, and the boards that regulate our science frown on me irradiating people.  So you're never really going to get the radiation, the microgravity component, but as you said, there are a lot of other stressors that influence people during space flight.  Those can be replicated to pretty high fidelity on the ground, the psychological aspects, the confinement, the circadian shifts, the stressors.  One of the things we prefer for immunology are in fact, these aren't really analog missions or mission simulations.  If you go to Antarctica, that's a real mission with real risk to self.  It's a dangerous place down there.  The air craft operations down there and the extreme temperatures, and so we call them space flight analogs, but in fact these are real missions to dangerous places.  So, to answer your question about what is stressful, there are different types of stress.   There are psychological stressors.  There are physiological stressors.  You being away from loved ones or being in a confined small craft is a psychological stressor.  Circadian misalignment might be a physiological stressor.  You have different mechanisms in the body, most of which are regulated by the immune system that control stress and your response to stress.  You have something called the fight or flight response.   Host: Right.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Which is you're either going to ramp up your adrenaline levels and want to engage that stressor if it's an acute stress, or if it's a chronic stress, you see changes mediated by the cortisol, which are generally immunosuppressive.  Elevated levels of cortisol are really not good.  And so space flight is a very unique stress model, we have learned through our data over the years.  It is a six-month long chronic stressor with intermittent acute stressors.  Space walks, stressful events on orbit.  Sometimes we purposefully circadian shift the crews because a vehicle is going to dock or undock.   Host: Right.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And so we don't really have a stress model like that on the ground, which is one of the reasons why the flight data that we're seeing may be so unique.  I think you asked about the flight-to-ground comparison, and yes, in some of these analogs from an immunological perspective, they look like flight, but we haven't seen one yet that looks exactly like flight.  And we look at dozens of different types of immune proteins in the blood, cytokines, and the distribution of these cells and their function.  We look at immune cell function in cell culture assays that we do.  And we haven't seen anything yet that looks exactly like flight.   Host: Well, you need to put them in the room with a gravity switch and blast them with radiation, and there you go.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, the IRB frowns on us doing that, so until then, we'll struggle using the closest analogs we can find and actually look at people during their missions, which is even better yet.   >>1Right.  So we talked a little bit about, you know, when we're talking about counter measures, just ways to prevent these, any sort of immune, I don't know, sickness, any kind of sickness when it comes to these astronauts.  There's a lot of things that you don't think of directly as counter measures, like, for example, getting a cold and taking cold medicine, but-- well maybe that's not a counter measure.  It's more of like a, I guess way to treat it.  But, yeah, what are some curious ways that we are, I guess, reducing the stress for the astronauts on board, making, I guess, just a friendlier environment.  It is a hostile environment, but as friendly as we can make it so that we're reducing their stress.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, what you're describing is a very bona fide approach to keeping astronauts healthy.  We want to reduce their stress, and so we enable them to talk to their families.  There's actually a satellite phone on board the space station, and they can call home when they need to.  We try and create work schedules that are palatable for them.  We don't want them to be working constantly and wearing themselves out.  They're working hard enough as it is, but we want to keep them healthy, and so we properly regulate their work schedules.  They're assigned psychological support folks on the ground that help get them say a TV show that they're interested in for free time or something like that, and so psychological support is very definitely something that it's happening on board ISS and something is being taken very seriously for the pending exploration missions.   Host: Right.  So it's these, these elements will be probably, I guess you can say they will be part of the exploration mission.  So if you have a long duration stay to Mars, they're going to be sending them these movies and just ways to sort of relax along the way, but then also there.  They're going to have to have some break time.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Yeah, what's interesting about considering the lunar missions or Mars missions that should happen by the 2020's, it's nice to see all that moving forward, is the vehicle design is happening now.  And so, on ISS, you're not far from home, and you have a tremendous amount of space with which to start to deploy exercise equipment, sleep compartments, carry a log of food, and these pending, these upcoming exploration missions, the situation will almost be the opposite.  You're not going to have a return option.  You're going to have a very small vehicle, and so one of the challenges I think NASA and international partner space agencies are dealing with is how to maximize the reductions in stress and the crew comfort and crew health on these missions while doing it farther from home, in a higher energy radiation environment with more stress.   Host: Yeah, yeah.  Now, thinking about missions, I guess beyond the space station, you know, now that we're kind of going towards that topic.  I'm thinking about systems really.  I'm thinking about, we're talking about a hostile environment, making the environment as I guess more comfortable, to make sure the crew is happy and healthy, which is very directly related to the immune system.  Because the happier they are, the healthier they are, you know, psychologically, physiologically, they're going to be successful on these missions.  But the systems that they're in, the closed environment that they have to be a part of, is a concern just in and of itself because right now on the space station let's just say, you know, the toilet, they have to fix the toilet a lot.  They have to fix the water recycling system a lot, and these are systems that need to be reliable for missions farther out, because you're talking about a system working as well as possible to make sure the crew is going to be healthy and happy for a three-year mission to Mars.   To Mars, on Mars, the way back from Mars.  Are these things that I guess from a human factor standpoint would be added stressors if we had to deal with maintaining systems and worrying about the reliability of these systems?   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, you're making excellent points, and I agree with what you're saying, and you're, I think what you're basically saying is vehicle design for these missions beyond the Van Allen Belt is a very serious consideration.   Host: Oh, yeah.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And so we've got the ability to afford repairs on ISS if we have to.  We can make a spacewalk.  There's enough room to have spare parts for a lot of different types of equipment.  You're simply not going to have those options in the far more dangerous environment of the lunar vicinity or transitioning to Mars.   ​[sound effect]  Host: And what that really comes down to is that systems have to be super reliable.  Stan Love had some ideas on what that means for astronauts.   ​[sound effect]  Stan Love:   The difficulty of transporting things to Mars means that we can take only the minimum amount of weight and things, and that includes spare parts.  The space station right now was built, you know, of course we can send spare parts whenever we want, but the last four shuttle missions to space station carried nothing but gigantic, multi-ton palettes of spare parts that were affixed to the outside of space station, and those things are waiting.  And we've used a few of those over the years since the shuttle program was cancelled, and, you know, we can't afford to have a third of the mass of our Mars mission be spare parts.  We'll never be able to go.  So that means we have to build machines that don't break, ever.  And we're getting good at that in some areas.  Jet engines, well there was a recent thing in the headlines with an engine through a turbine blade.  The jet engines are incredibly reliable these days.  You get millions of run hours, you know, before you get a failure.  But if we could make everything on the spacecraft, especially that recycling equipment--   Host: Oh yeah.   Stan Love:   That level of reliability, but now it has to be built with extra structural margin so that it doesn't get cracks in it.  You make things thicker.  That makes them heavier.  You have to test them for decades, right, that's how long a jet engine can last, to make sure they're going to last those years.  So it becomes, you add weight, you add expense, you add development time to prove that things are that reliable.   ​[sound effect]  Dr. Brian Crucian: That's a great point, and I think what you're getting at is what if something goes wrong, either from a vehicle perspective or from a clinical perspective?  And we actually have learned quite a bit on ISS about what happens if something goes wrong from a clinical perspective.  In addition to researchers characterizing what is happening in astronauts, we also want to know if they become ill, and that is to a certain extent their confidential medical data.  That's not part of a research study, but for obvious reasons, we're interested in what is the incidence of infectious disease onboard ISS.  What happens onboard ISS clinically.  And so we have an epidemiology group at the Johnson Space Center that very kindly compiled a lot of that data for us through the first 40 or so ISS expeditions in fact.  They do have some degree of clinical incidence onboard station.  We generally haven't heard a lot about that.  It's not a tremendous amount.  It's nothing that's of a serious concern, I think, for NASA or for the public, but it's happening.   And so you have infectious diseases on board ISS.  Some rare crews have some dermatitis issues that persist during flight, and so characterizing that on ISS is a very prudent thing to do because we don't want things like that to get worse on the way to Mars.  But you mentioned the return option, and yes, we have that rapid return option onboard ISS, and we won't have that on the way to Mars.  And so we very definitely need to characterize the human system onboard ISS during orbital space flight before we put it in this smaller, more constrained vehicle and put it out into this higher energy radiation environment for say a several-years mission to another planet.   Host: That's right.  Now based on what we know, from an immunology perspective, we talked a little bit with Dr. [inaudible] again, about medication.  Do we know enough about immunology where, is there something universal that we can apply to the astronauts, maybe medication or maybe some sort of counter measure that can help prevent it, or is there a more personalized route that we really have to be considering, like a personalized medication or some kind of, I don't know, something [inaudible].  I mean not sure.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, you made a very good point before when we were talking about getting a cold, and the medications you take after that or a treatment.   Host: Yeah.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And so you can look at the med kit onboard station and parse that out into okay what are the treatments, most of it is treatments, but what are the counter measures?  And the counter measure is something that you're going to take before you get sick.   Host: Right.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And try and prevent the development of illness because you're fixing what's broken in your physiology.  And that is something that the community is still discussing, what will the counter measures be, what are the treatments.  You also mentioned personalized medicine.  And that's going to be a very important part of biomedical counter measures for space flight.  We have folks that are experts in this, Jeff Ginsberg in particular, who are starting to work with NASA and help us figure out how to take personalized medicine, precision medicine, and apply it to our unique problem, which is very healthy people in an adverse environment, and we want to keep them healthy.  And so, we may need to be screening our astronauts at some point in the future.  Do they have a predisposition to allergy or not?  We might tailor a counter measure to them or for them based on their own personal history.  If they get more infectious diseases than another crew member, we would like to know that.  There are even some biomedical tests that you can perform to look at say their predisposition to inflammation or I'm speculating perhaps their individual microbiome, which latent viruses they are seropositive for and which ones they're not.   The whole variety of things that we might consider looking at an individual astronauts as a screen prior to sending them on these exploration missions, because it would help us guide their personalized suite of counter measures.   Host: But it sounds like we sort, we already understand what we need to look for before we send someone out on a deep space mission.  You're already screening them, you're already sort of understanding their physiology and what they may need to be successful on a space flight.  Is that something that we can do, do a lot of testing beforehand and understand what we'll need for a long trip?   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, the answer is yes.  We can do that.  We're not doing that yet.  We don't really have a need to do that for ISS missions.  ISS is really the adverse environment that is near to us that we can use to characterize these phenomenon, and honestly we're still learning.  Even this many years into the lifespan of ISS, we're still characterizing various biomedical phenomenon and learning.  We recently learned that astronauts have a vision issue that were generally unaware of until a few years ago, and we're learning about subtle aspects of the immune system response to space flight that we didn't know until very recently.  There are some very interesting articles that will be coming out soon.  Dr. Rickey Simpson at the University of Arizona is going to publish an article looking at the function of natural killer cells, I mentioned those before, in astronauts.  This was completely unknown before his study that in fact NK cell function is depressed in astronauts.   Host: Huh.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And that persists for a six-month mission.  And so even now we're still learning aspects of physiology that are altered that we may need to target these counter measures for.   Host: Wow.  So is there something that we can do I guess before space flight.  Like what are we doing before they even launch to really make sure that they are going to be successful, at least right now for the space station.  Is there counter measures or preparation studies that we're doing to understand this information?   Dr. Brian Crucian: So we are not really implementing specific immune countermeasures.  And in fact, our biomedical elements within the human research program are all collectively working to characterize their systems and talk about their counter measures.  You have had some successful counter measures.  Potassium citrate, Dr. Peggy Wittson was the principal investigator for a study that looked at renal stone risk onboard ISS and successfully validated using potassium citrate pills as a counter measure for that.  But generally, we're all a little less mature in our counter measures development.  And so collectively, the disciplines within the human research program are looking at this.  You're going to see more translational counter measures be discussed.  I've heard of the integrated counter measures suite, and so it's impossible to implement a counter measure for one system and not have it influence another system.  Your immune counter measures are probably going to have a positive or negative influence on bone, cardio, [inaudible] pathogen interactions, and conversely, just about any counter measure you can think someone might implement for another system, say exercise, is going to positive affect immune.   And so really you have a lot of integration in NASA's approach to looking at the problems and in the develop of the counter measures.   Host: So looking kind of forward to let's just say we have a long duration stay on the moon.  We're looking at the moon to really get more data to understand what's needed to go even further out, to have a habitat on Mars.  What are some of the interesting things if we were to have a long duration mission, say six months, maybe even a year on the moon, that can really give us insight into even missions even farther out, from an immune perspective.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, the moon is a very interesting place.   Host: Yeah.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And from an immune perspective, we really feel that the destination almost doesn't matter.  When you're beyond the Van Allen Belt and you increase the radiation and you increase the stress and you're living in constant microgravity, it doesn't matter where you go.  You're probably going to manifest the same types of immune problems from one destination to another.  Living on the moon is an interesting consideration though because you're not in pure microgravity.  Now you're in one-sixth gravity.   Host: Right.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And so I don't think anybody knows, if you look at a moving scale from zero gravity to one times the force of gravity we have here, where does the problem start.  Is half gravity enough?  Is one-sixth enough?  I don't think anybody knows.  There have been some fractional gravity bedrest studies that have been implemented, but I don't think they really were able to look at the immune system because bedrest isn't the best analog, I don't believe, for the immune system.  But it is something that folks are aware of.  There has been an artificial gravity study that NASA worked at in Galveston at the University of UTMB down there, UTMB, in Galveston, sorry.  You can stitch that together, that looked at artificial gravity as a countermeasure, and so, yeah, fractional, when you talk about the moon, you're really talking about fractional gravitational forces and what's the effect of that on physiology, and that's an area I don't think anybody has really been able to investigate.   It's very difficult to investigate that on Earth, because you're in a constant 1G field, and you just can't get away from it as much as it would be great to have that 0G room, we just don't have that.   Host: So it seems like gravity is just a consideration for a lot of different things, talking with a lot of the other experts, it's for this immune system.  It's for the crew behavioral health.  Fluid shifts.  You know, there's a lot of exercise, bone, muscle loss, a lot of things that are associated with just this lack of understanding of what happens in the one-sixth gravity environment.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Yeah.  We evolved as people in a constant 1G field, and no one had ever been out of it until the first astronauts and cosmonauts launched in the '60's, and I don't think anybody fully realized what being outside of gravity can do to your body.  And we see astronauts working very successfully and enjoying their stays onboard ISS, but if you take cells out of the body, immune cells out of the body, I can pull T cells from your blood right now, and if we put them in culture and we stimulate them and try and re-create an immune response, they literally don't work.  They don't respond.   Host: Huh.   Dr. Brian Crucian: And that is absent stress, radiation, or anything else.  Just having these cells cultured in microgravity, they don't respond.  And so investigators on the ground, NASA and external investigators have been doing flight studies of cell culture and culturing cells in ground-based apparatuses, ground-based apparatus, such as a bioreactor, which mimics microgravity culture to try and figure out why, and it appears that there are gravity-sensitive weight points in say the signal transduction pathways where the cell tells the nucleus how to respond, that are gravity sensitive.  Who would have ever thought that our cells would have a gravity-sensitive weight point within them and that they would stop working in microgravity, and yet that appears to be the case.   Host: Wow.  I don't even know what you do with that.  I mean there's not like, there's no like pill you can take.  I mean like there's a gravity pill-- yeah, that's a huge consideration.   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, there's a couple things you could do.  I mean there are immune boosters, immune stimuli that might help overcome this effect to some degree.  People have considered artificial gravity as a counter measure.  Seen 2001 of Space Odyssey, if you could rotate the vehicle and get gravity back, it might help mitigate some of those effects.  But also, I mentioned that we can pull cells out of you and me, stimulate them to microgravity and they wouldn't respond.  And yet, the astronauts are very healthy on orbit.  So we don't necessarily know if that phenomenon is reproduced inside the body, because the cells in the body are not just floating in a pristine microgravity environment.  They're moving.  They're moving through the blood, and they're migrating in and out of tissues and they're looking for targets to respond to to keep you healthy.  So it's a, where we're bringing this home to is it's a very complicated consideration.  Every system is complicated.   In particular, the immune system, all these cells and the environment they have to function in and keeping them functioning properly to maintain our health, it's a complicated consideration.   Host: I think that's actually a good place to start wrapping up because this is the end of our hazards series.  This is the last episode, and the theme that I've sort of heard throughout this entire series so far is we've sectioned off each of the hazards and really gone deep into what those hazards mean, but throughout my talks the all of the experts, all of you guys, what I've really learned is that everything is connected.  You can't just look at just the immune system.  You got to think about what the gravity is doing and what the bone and muscle is doing and what, you know, how does fluid shifts go into this, going far away.  You know, everything is, everything is connected.  So, you know, one thing we talked about actually with another, Dr. Eric Antonsen, you know, we just talked to them, so it's all fresh in my mind, that particular talk, but we were talking about how all the experts are getting together and providing input.  So when you are getting together and talking about this deep space exploration, what are some of the key things that you try to, that you try to make sure that we are implementing into our future space flight plans?   Dr. Brian Crucian: So you're absolutely right, and we actually have a name for that phenomenon and what you're describing is interdisciplinary science or translational science.  And we have collectively learned that as a team over the lifespan of ISS, as the nutrition folks have, Dr. Scott Smith's lab at JSC have looked at inflammation and bone markers and nutritional status, and they have been talking to the immune team down the hall, and we've been looking at immune mediators, and we're starting to connect the dots between these systems.  We've learned what exercise can do to the immune system, what fluid shifts can do to the immune system, and what inflammation does to a variety of systems.  And so we have a name for that phenomenon, and as you so aptly put, we're working together now collectively, more than we ever have before, to address clinical risk to crew members as sort of a unified team of investigators across all of these disciplines.  You asked what we'll do about this going forward, and so you're seeing more joint solicitations for science projects or translational solicitations.   Instead of NASA or an agency looking to do a cardio study or an immune study, you're seeing broader solicitations now where the agencies that fund are encouraging investigators to look at translational aspects of their system or their findings and also interdisciplinary interpretations of data.  An immune study that was completed years ago, we now have folks pulling some of that information.  Dr. Han Lu Wu in NASA radiation is pulling some of the immune data from a study several years ago where he had radiation data.  So he's looking at say inflammation and correlating that with radiation to see if there's a relationship there.  And so the bottom line is more translational work, more interdisciplinary work, looking at these things together within our areas in JSC and also with European scientists, Canadian, Japan, Russian.  We have several very interesting studies that the Japanese Space Agency is working on, looking at [inaudible] analyses of astronauts on the International Space Station or probiotics as a counter measure.   We're very excited to see these studies mature and the data that they'll show, and it just keeps feeding more information that all of us use to help to close our clinical risks to crew members for these pending exploration missions.   Host: Collaboration is so important, but I did want to end on a more selfish note.  And that is, what are you, from your immunology perspective, looking forward to most for these deep space missions, to figure out?   Dr. Brian Crucian: Well, I'll answer first selfishly.  I'm looking forward to just seeing them happen.  I'm 50 now, and so I'm very excited to see people go beyond the Van Allen Belt and get to doing some real space exploration.  As a scientist, I'm looking forward to basically characterizing our system, the immune system as much as possible and start to have that dialogue about counter measures.  As I alluded to before, we've got a big suite of counter measure options for immunology.  Nutritional supplements, functional foods, probiotics, medications.  And so we plan to have discussions here within the next couple of years where we will engage flight surgeons, researchers, practicing clinical immunologists, people that are actually treating patients.  We want them to come here, see our data, and help us figure out what would be the best counter measure for astronauts on a three-year mission to Mars.  After we make that decision, then we'll have to probably spend some time looking at these counter measures, validating them in a ground analog, or hopefully onboard ISS, on ISS before the end of its lifespan so that we can have these counter measures ready for these deep space exploration missions.   Host: I'm very excited for it.  Brian, thank you so much for coming on and sharing your perspective about these hostile and closed environments, especially from the immunology perspective.  I really appreciate.   Dr. Brian Crucian: I've enjoyed it.  Thank you for having me.    [ Music ]   Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So today we talked with Dr. Brian Crucian about immunology and that aspect of the hostile and closed environments.  That wraps up our five hazards of human space flight podcast episodes.  You can go back and listen to previous episodes.  They're not in really any particular order, but we have associated products that go with those.  If you go to NASA.gov/hrp, there's a series of videos that are associated with each of these five hazards that are short animation videos, really give you a nice kind of overview perspective.  You can go there to watch those videos.  Otherwise, a lot of the stuff that we talked about today and a lot of our podcasts happen on the International Space Station, go to NASA.gov/ISS to find the latest there.  On social media, that's where we're looking for our questions and really answering them here on today's podcast.  On Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, you can use the #askNASA on the International Space Station or NASA Johnson Space Center accounts to ask a question or maybe submit an idea for an episode that you'd really like us to dive deep into, for Houston We Have a Podcast.  Just make sure to mention Houston We Have a Podcast.  That's how I find it.  Because there's a lot of ask NASA questions that we actually cover.   So this episode was recorded on June 28, 2018.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, Pat Ryan, Bill Stafford, Bill Polaski, Judy Hayes, Isidro Reyna, Mel Whiting, and Natalie Gogins.  And thanks again to Brian Crucian for coming on the show.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 156, “Deep Space Transport.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. Our Mars Monthly series continues. Last month we sat down with Patrick Chai, who described the challenges of rendezvousing with Mars, a little bit about trajectory, timing and propulsion. On this episode, we'll be talking about what's needed for the vehicle that will be doing the rendezvousing and transporting the Martian crew, the Deep Space Transport. See, the journey to Mars will be a long one, so the vehicle will need to be designed to support a crew on the nine-month ride to the Martian surface. That vehicle will need to remain in orbit around Mars while the crew explores the surface and be ready to go back for the nine-month journey. So here to go into detail about what we need to design a place to live on the way to and from Mars, or a Mars Transit Habitat, is Paul Kessler. He's an Aerospace engineer at Langley Research Center in Virginia. He's working on vehicle design and mission analysis in the Space Mission Analysis Branch for the Mars Integration Group. Paul describes the challenges that come with designing such a vehicle and some of the considerations for how to tackle these challenges. So here we go. The journey to Mars and back on the Deep Space Transport with Paul Kessler. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Paul Kessler, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today.  Paul Kessler: Thank you for having me.  Host: Well, this is certainly an interesting thing to be working on, is -- you know, I always like to relate Mars missions to what you see in the movies. You always see when, you know, humans are traveling between star systems and, you know, they're going hyperspace, or whatever, they're in these big, gigantic vehicles. And, of course, that's what, I think, we all think, you know, there's just going to be this gigantic city-sized thing that's going to be taking us from planet to planet. But your part of that group that's thinking about what that would look like if we were to take a transport from Earth to Mars, is that right?  Paul Kessler: Oh, yeah, that's definitely it.  Host: Very cool. Well, tell us about yourself and your background. What got you to what you're doing today?  Paul Kessler: Well, I did get a master's degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Colorado. I been working with NASA -- after a few years of working with [Department of Defense] DoD, I started working with NASA doing science mission work, and eventually I ended up becoming a government civil servant and I've been working human exploration since then within my branch. I am a part of the Mars Integration Group, doing a lot of work there, trying to understand what is the most likely scenarios and the best scenarios that we can take on for going to Mars.  Host: Well, let's start kind of big picture here. We're talking about a vehicle that is going to transport humans to Mars. So, what are some of the first things we have to think about when we're just about to think, OK, what is this going to look like?  Paul Kessler: Well, I think the first things we think about are a lot of the first things we think about when we're going to buy a home. We want to know how much space it's going to have, because when we have a home, we have to put things in it. We have to put our food and our supplies. We have to have maybe that extra attic just to hold any additional stuff that we want to keep in our house. But with regards to this Mars transport, it's important to know that you have to bring everything with you, and not just those items, not just the food and not just the food for, let's say a few days or a week, however often you go shopping, but you have to actually bring it for the entire journey, including anything that you need to repair any items and including all the oxygen supplies that you need, because you need to be able to breathe in that thing. So, the big idea, one, is primarily space and you have to have different working spaces. You have to have places to sleep and you have to have places to clean up, you have to have places go to the restroom. But you also have to have places to do science and exploration and all the fun stuff, and then you have to have a chance to be able to sit down with your astronaut friends and have some food.  Host: A place to live, a place to work, a place to sleep. And then it sounds like a lot of the space that you're thinking about for this thing is not only the systems that have to keep you alive and maintain the human presence, and just the vehicle itself through this long, long journey, but my assumption, and correct me if I'm wrong, is a lot of backups and a lot of ways to add a little bit of redundancy because, to your point, there's no pit stops, there's no gas stations, there's no restocking here when you're talking about this kind of vehicle.  Paul Kessler: Yeah, you got it exactly right. And that's one of the biggest drivers when we're talking about an entire transportation system that has to also push that around. The advantage of your home when you buy it, unless, of course, I guess you're taking a mobile home and you're driving it around, really, your home is just static, you're not having to move it around. The air's just doing all that for you. But when you have to go through space, you got to push that around and you're going to have to have a propulsion system that's capable of doing that. So really, everything that you bring has to have really a purpose, and that doesn't just mean that it has to have a functional purpose in all cases, but it certainly has to have also a psychological purpose. But to your point, you're talking about journeys that can last up to three years and you have to bring everything in order to fix that thing because we know that you want to make it a safe journey to and from Mars.  Host: So, with that in mind, if you're adding all of these elements to this vehicle design that you're thinking about, what are we -- what can we picture in terms of size? I'm sure it's not going to be the city-sized things that you see in science fiction, but I think the one that I think a lot of us naturally gravitate towards is the International Space Station. The size relative to that.  Paul Kessler: Yeah. The size to the International Space Station, we're probably talking about maybe one-third of the size, and we're talking about something that's probably going to be equivalent to maybe a thousand square foot house. We're talking about 200 to 300 cubic meters, is probably the overall size that we're going to be dealing with, at least initially. Of course, those other types of systems, I mean, those are possibilities over time. It's just a matter of whether or not that's the way that we want to go into the long-term future. But for now, that's where we're looking at.  Host: OK. So, let's dive deep into things you got to consider. Now that we have a good idea of size, let's talk about those things that we can pack inside of it. So, you already alluded to a few of those things. I think one of the primary things would be propulsion. You got to give this thing a little juice.  Paul Kessler: Yeah, that's true. And then we also have to pack it full of not just food and water, but we also even have to pack it full of medical supplies, medicines, things like that, trash bags, things that -- throw away your trash. You've got to take care of trash in space just as much as you do at home, and you've got to be able to handle waste, you've got to be able handle scrubbing the air and taking out any sort of contamination that might be in the air. And then you also want to be able to have the oxygen necessary and filter out some of that carbon dioxide. So those are a lot of those big things, but then along with that, yeah, you have to push it with the propulsion system itself.  Host: That's right. Yeah, trash is a big one. I know in the International Space Station they have, they put a lot of trash right now in the logistics model, over attached to Node 3. They kind of put it in there for a little bit and then as cargo craft, and this is one of the benefits of being in low-Earth orbit, you got cargo craft going to and from the International Space Station quite often and you can take out the trash. You can load up those cargo vehicles with trash and take them away. Now, what sorts of considerations are we thinking about for space and for trash disposal, trash removal for a Deep Space Transport?  Paul Kessler: Well, I think one of the biggest things is that we want to try to keep the burden on our transportation as low as possible, and part of that is that we don't want to have to carry around a bunch of trash because that's just going to cost more fuel. So periodically we need to make sure that we dump trash outside of the vehicle, and we have to make sure that it's not going to hit any other parts of the vehicle and cause damage. So that's a real key attribute to it as well.  Host: Now, OK, so you mentioned life support. There's got to be a lot of space for the life support systems, and I don't know if there's, you know, any consideration to extra or maybe different redundancy, or even different technologies for a Deep Space Transport, based to what I'm used to on the International Space Station. Not that I've been there, but just familiar with it.  Paul Kessler: Right. Yeah, there's definitely a lot of trades and analysis that's being done at NASA with some very strong consideration for what's been done in the past on ISS. We're doing a lot of learning from the things that we have, and that's a really important key. Whenever we want to do any of these bigger explorations, we don't want to just dump all the knowledge that we've had and not actually leverage it. We want to leverage all the knowledge that we're gaining, and a lot of that goes also to the [Environmental Control and Life Support Systems] ECLSS systems themselves. Now, the thing that's distinct and different maybe from ISS is that ECLSS system, again, we want it to be a little bit more closed, and what that means is we want to try to recover more water and things like that, and we want to be able to make it more regenerative, be able to produce our own oxygen. The reason for that is that we can drive down the amount of things that we need to put on that system at the start, but just trying to get that right level of closure, that's a real key. And there's some people that are doing some great analysis on that front as well, and it is a huge burden on the entire transportation system as to this life support system, and so trying to find the right knobs to turn to get it to the right optimal levels is really, really key. And as we go through and do these analyses, I'm sure that we're going to gain a lot more knowledge, but it is important that with any ECLSS system that we -- and I'm saying ECLSS, but we haven't introduced it, the environmental control and life support system. Whenever we're talking about that, it's important to get a lot of time on those systems, that we make sure that they are reliable, that they're really going to carry us through the whole way because we're talking a very long period of time on those systems and we want them to satisfy our needs over the long duration.  Host: Yeah, it's about that reliability, you want these systems to work over time. And then also, in terms of ECLSS systems, in terms of these environmental control systems, I mean, I know they're hooked up to -- that water is a part of this, but I know even on the space station they have a toilet and that toilet breaks, and I know you want to limit how often that breaks. And I know, I think they're actually gearing up the space station for an upgraded toilet to test some of the new technologies that may be on future spacecraft like these.  Paul Kessler: That's right. That's correct.  Host: And that's a big deal, to make sure that that reliability is there. Even a thermal amine. That's one of my favorites. This is a carbon dioxide scrubber and it's a new technology that might provide extra carbon dioxide scrubbing, or even better or more efficient over longer periods of time. So, all fantastic technologies.  Paul Kessler: Oh, yeah, and it's paramount to get a lot of use time on those systems, especially in space. So, preparing for Mars, we want to make sure that we're doing all of that. Whether it be on our systems up near the Gateway, or whether it be in ISS, we want to make sure that we get a lot of time on those systems to make sure that they're fully ready for that long journey.  Host: Now, they're going to be ready for that long journey, but they don't have to do it themselves. They're on this spacecraft. I know you see it a lot in movies, even today, just a crew, they seem almost completely isolated, you know, it's just they're talking amongst themselves, but they do have support from Earth. Even today on the space station they're talking with the flight controllers on the ground all the time, but I think the operations might be different. So, what are we looking at in terms of communication systems and then how we use that now that we're going a little bit further away from Earth?  Paul Kessler: Yeah. I think the key there is the time, the delay time. I think you saw this in popular movies like \"The Martian,\" where there was a significant period of time between when something happened and when somebody knew about it, and I think we've seen this in a lot of other shows as well. But the thing is, is we've got time delay on our communications as well just because of the great distances we're talking about from Earth. And then additionally, we have situations where we could end up being behind the sun or something where our data links might be a little bit degraded or it may be harder for us to get that info transferred back and forth between the crew. So it's really going to be on the crew primarily to make sure that all their systems are running because in a critical moment, when it comes down to it, they're going to be the first ones on the scene and they're not going to get the help they need as quickly as they might need it, especially the closer that we get to Mars and the further away we are from Earth.  Host: Yeah, a little bit of autonomy, and I'm sure that's going to come with a lot of training as well.  Paul Kessler: Oh, definitely. And I know that NASA has already looked at ideas of using virtual reality to do training, even doing training on orbit. I believe they're doing a lot of that also on ISS.  Host: Now, in terms of the materials, you know, are we going to see something maybe made out of a lot of the same materials that we see on the International Space Station? I've seen some expandable technology demonstrations in the past. What are we looking at for what this thing is made out of?  Paul Kessler: Well, I think it's still a little bit up in the air about where NASA wants to go with the type of systems that it's going to choose, but we have some great contractors that we're working with on a contract that are doing some of that development and telling us where the right systems are, what they look like and what we should be utilizing. We have systems that include some of these inflatable structures that you talk about. Now, a lot of times when people think about inflatable, they might think of a balloon, but these inflatable structures are a lot firmer. They feel a lot more like hard structures when they're fully expanded than they would maybe a balloon. And we've looked at those because the advantage to that as well could be that you could get more volume for less mass. Now, it's a newer technology so there is some learning to have to do on that, so the way that we have to go in the future is to really try to flesh out those structures and make sure that they're really ready for the long duration and whether or not we can really rely on them. And so, we're really trying to buy that down with a lot of these contracts, is try to understand what those would look like and try to buy down the risks by doing more testing and understanding of those systems. And then at the same time we're leaving it open to the ideas that would utilize systems that are a lot like ISS. But, you know, with that, there might also be a change in the way that you would want to use those systems in terms of if you think that it makes more sense to put things at Mars beforehand, or whatever. So, we're leaving a lot of that trade space open and we'll be coming to more conclusions as time goes on, but I think we're making a lot of headway right now with the wonderful contractors that we've been working with so far.  Host: Wonderful. Now, I know that the journey itself is a little bit different from what we're used to with the International Space Station. I know I keep going to it, but in terms of just a habitat where people live in space, that's naturally where I gravitate towards. But low-Earth orbit is a little bit different from deep space. You got a little bit of protection from the Earth. In fact, the space station is going on the other side of Earth relative to the sun. So naturally, things like I think about are the radiation environment on the journey to Mars, the thermal environment on the journey to Mars. What are these considerations that the Deep Space Transport is going to have to deal with for the environment on the way there?  Paul Kessler: Yeah. I mean, I think you've touched on it a lot, is the radiation when we're at ISS is not necessarily going to be as bad because we've got the magnetic field around the Earth that's really deflecting a lot of that radiation. But as we go further out and we venture out there, we're going to have to deal with galactic cosmic radiation that's coming from other galaxies, and supernovas and stuff like that. And then we're also going to have to deal with a little bit type of radiation, and that's the solar radiation that we get. And in those instances, what we do is we try to mitigate it with systems where we can have a safe place to hunker down if there's a storm that comes about, and we have abilities to detect those kind of things and that's what we have to do during those situations, is get behind a lot of things and make sure that we're safe from that radiation. But that's definitely a big-hitter item. Another thing, like you talked about, was the thermal, especially if we ever think about going away from Earth, going further out into the solar system, we know that the thermal characteristics are going to be quite different. The further you are from the sun, or even if you're getting much, much closer to the sun, if you decide to swing by Venus or something like that, you're going to have to really reject a lot of additional heat in those cases. So those are really critical because we want to make sure that our astronauts in those situations have a shirt-sleeve environment that our systems survive, that our systems are doing well, in terms of thermally. And then I think another thing is that we have to consider the fact that gravity also, or the lack thereof in this case, is also something that's going to affect the human body. So, in that vein we also have to make sure that we have exercise equipment and we try to fight back against the lack of gravity that we're doing on the way to and from Mars because that's the longest part of the journey.  Host: Yeah. You know, we're talking a lot about what could be onboard and things you have to think about to go onboard of a Deep Space Transport, but you were talking about swinging by Venus, and that brings up another point is when you're designing this spacecraft that's going to take people to Mars, what is the profile that you're looking at? In terms of a mission profile, let's say we have the Deep Space Transport, what is this looking like? You know, is it as simple as people just hop onboard of a Deep Space Transport, it takes off from Earth and heads over to Mars? I'm sure it's a little bit more complicated than that.  Paul Kessler: Yeah. Right now we're looking at -- as far as our departure and arrival, we're looking at going from an Earth orbit that's really, really big, that goes out all the way to the Moon itself, to the Moon's orbit itself, and that we would get the crew to come from Earth to rendezvous with the transportation system, and then they would transfer on and then they would leave from there to go to Mars. Now, the advantage to something like that is that we have a lot of the gravitational capability that the Earth gives us that we can use to leverage to get us a little bit more velocity. Then we could head to Mars. And when we come back, we would -- right now we're looking at entering back into that large orbit. We call it a HEO orbit or a highly elliptical orbit, or a higher-Earth orbit. And then we could get the crew off of there at the end of that mission and then that system would go autonomously back to the NRHO. So, the NRHO is a near-rectilinear halo orbit. It's a fancy term for there's and orbit around a point in space that's really near the Moon and it's just a really nice orbit for us in terms of its stability and not having to do a lot of boosting, and we could go there. And we also have good access, by the way, to the lunar surface, which is all a part of that whole Artemis mission as well, where that orbit is also where the Gateway is. So, at the Gateway we would put the habitat itself and we would prepare it, we would outfit it, we would test out a lot of its systems before we go on to those long journeys and before those transportation systems themselves even arrive.  Host: Excellent. OK. So, I'm sure a lot of things being put into Gateway, you're thinking a little bit ahead as well. Not only are you -- you want this Gateway for the Artemis missions as sort of an outpost in this near-rectilinear halo orbit, but it seems like a good place from a trajectory standpoint to get to Mars.  Paul Kessler: Yeah, it's a good point to stage everything. So, what I mean by that is that we can get a lot of stuff up to this particular orbit and we can put a lot of things there without having to try to do a lot of reboosting or anything like that and, therefore, we can save ourselves on a lot of propellent. Then we can go from there to that higher-Earth orbit before we leave, and we can save ourselves a lot of fuel in the end. I think I've heard as far as 20% more mass, or something like that, additional if you go to the NRHO.  Host: So, in terms of the vehicle itself, naturally what comes to my mind is, again, the International Space Station, but this vehicle is continuously occupied. You got people on it now coming up on 20 years continuously. So, you have folks onboard to fix things if they break and attend to things as needed on top of all the experiments that they do, but would this Deep Space Transport be able to be unoccupied for periods of time waiting there for a crew to arrive and take it to Mars?  Paul Kessler: Yeah, it's going to have to be. At least as far as we're looking at now, it's going to be that way. So, we will have to have systems that can help maintain the habitat itself. We've got to have a lot of autonomy there. We've got to have a lot of capability to do things from the ground while we're outfitting or between missions, and between Artemis missions even, while we're preparing this vehicle to go to Mars.  Host: Now, we're talking a lot close to Earth, you know, we're going to do all these things close to Earth and then here we go, here we go to Mars. So, what does that journey look like, in terms of length of time and in terms of what you imagine the astronauts to be doing during that length of time until they actually arrive to Mars?  Paul Kessler: Oh, very good questions.  Host: Yeah.  Paul Kessler: We have different trajectories that we're looking at now that are still within our trade space, which is what we're trying to analyze, and some of those can be as low as 700-ish days of an entire round trip, with maybe a short stay on the Mars surface, about 30 days is what we're talking about, or we could have even longer missions that last about three years. The advantages of each side are, with the shorter missions, naturally humans are in space a shorter amount of time, which is better for the body and it allows us to do maybe shorter missions on the Mars surface. Now, with the longer missions the advantage is being on the surface of Mars longer, but at the same time, we save a lot on propellent and having to have large systems to push us all the way to and from Mars. Now, we're looking at both of those options. We're looking at, within this trade space, about what makes the most sense based off of the risks that NASA, the agency, wants to take, and what sort of things that we want to accomplish. Now you asked a second question, which was what would the astronauts do on these long journeys? Well, I think they would do a little bit of things that we would probably do on a very long journey, and I don't think it would be singing “The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round,” or anything like that, but they might play some video games or have a good time, just have some time to get to know each other, and also doing a lot of maintenance of systems because that's one thing that we spend a lot of time doing already. We want to make sure that we maintain our systems on ISS. We want to make sure to do the same thing in transit. Then you'd be doing a lot of experiments, and you might even be doing a lot of photography of different things. If you pass by a special type planetary body, something like if you did a fly-by of Venus, it'd be kind of neat to take some video, some pictures and things like that. So, you can imagine that humans would be doing a lot of those things, along with the day-to-day items like their work, their workout, which is part of their work, just trying to keep their body from deteriorating on any long trips, but they would also have those times to eat and have fun.  Host: And I know keeping busy is a big part of even mental health. We've talked with some psychologists here on the podcast recently and, you know, just when you imagine those space missions, again, going back to those movies, they always kind of look a little bit bored, like they're just kind of waiting, you know, to arrive there. But the truth is, they got a lot to do, based on what you're saying. They have exercise, they have eating, they got photography, they got science. I mean, they're going to have a lot of ways to fill their time on the journey over to Mars.  Paul Kessler: Definitely, yeah. You want to make sure that they are mentally well, as well as physically well. So, it's important that we do keep them busy doing really good work and something that they find enjoyable as well. So, we don't want them to just do, you know, 12-hour days of working. We want them to actually have opportunities to decompress, to have some time just making friendships and building on their friendships, or even just trying to have some fun time, just playing some games, or whatever it might be.  Host: Yeah, getting together and singing “99 Bottles of Tang on the Wall.”  Paul Kessler: [Laughter] That's right. Good one.  Host: [Laughter] So, there's a lot. Now, let's go to Mars, right. So, we're talking about the journey on the way to Mars. Now, let's say you're arriving. So, I'm sure getting there you got to go pretty fast, so at some point you got to slow down. Now what are you doing? Is this thing going to go into a Mars orbit? That's what I'm thinking.  Paul Kessler: Yeah, that's right. So, we speed up, but as we're getting there, we're going to have to slow ourselves down, start trying to match the speed of the planet itself, such that we can start falling into an actual orbit. Now, when we're in that orbit, we're going to be doing a lot of preparations for a mission to the surface, and part of that is going to be rendezvousing and docking with the actual lander that would be used to go to the surface. And as we're doing that and as we're preparing for those kind of things, you know, those are the critical times because if anything were to not work out exactly right, we want to be able to have contingencies available, we want to be able to have additional fuel and other things in order to continue to try to do more dockings with that so that we can continue to move on and have a successful mission itself and not have to abandon anything that we're doing there. But that would be the biggest thing, is that we have to rendezvous and dock with our lander.  Host: See, that's huge. There's a lot of staging involved before this transport even starts heading to Mars. One of them being this lander in a --  Paul Kessler: Yep.  Host: -- in a predictable orbit to meet up with. So that is part of it, is the lander itself would not be part of this Deep Space Transport vehicle. You're talking about a rendezvous in Mars orbit.  Paul Kessler: That's right. So, things would have to be sent prior to us getting there, and those things would have to be sent on a previous opportunity, two and a half-ish years prior to us leaving, or the astronauts leaving. And while those are there, we need to check out those systems from the ground before we even send the crew to make sure that they are where they're going to need to be for the crew when they get there. There's no point in leaving Earth if things aren't checking out appropriately. But so, we would do those kind of checkouts before they leave so that when they arrive, they do know that their chances of rendezvousing and doing all those things are really, really high and it's a safe journey.  Host: Now, what else do they need to stage? They got the lander in orbit. What else has to be ready for them before the transport gets to Mars?  Paul Kessler: Yeah. So you have to have a lander, but you also have to have something that is going to take the crew back from the surface to the actual habitat itself as a separate thing because it's got to have its own fuel, and trying to figure out a way to try to put that all in one lander is a real challenge. Now, there may be a point in time in the future that we might be able to do all of that, but for the meantime, we would have to have something like that that would get them back to the actual habitat. Now, if you're going to do a longer stay, you're going to have to have a lot more systems on the surface, such as larger habitats, and things like that.  Host: So yeah, so that's a big thing. This lander that they're going to be rendezvousing with in Mars orbit, that's just a separate vehicle from an ascent vehicle on Mars. You said combining them would be a challenge. So now we're talking we got a transport vehicle, we got a landing vehicle and we got an ascent vehicle, and then to your point, depending on the mission profile, if it is longer, they're going to need a place to live.  Paul Kessler: That's right. That's right. And you could look at anything from having some sort of rover that they go down on, where they can actually drive around the surface of Mars and then also make it over to the ascent vehicle itself, or you could have static habitats themselves that they would go in. We're trying to do a lot of our practicing on Artemis missions for doing those types of things on Mars. So, using Artemis as the backbone for understanding what it would look like going to Mars is really, really helpful. Now, there will be some differences, but all the overlap that we can get is really, really helpful because as you can imagine, going to Mars is really, really hard and it's expensive. If we were just starting from scratch, then it would be a really difficult thing to really achieve. So, we're just trying to fill all of our knowledge gaps that we might have by developing these technologies and using them also on Artemis missions and other things.  Host: So, what are some of those other pros to doing this at the Moon first? Why practice at the Moon?  Paul Kessler: Well, I mean, we're very close to home so it's a lot easier for us to abort the mission and head back to either the Gateway itself, because it will be near the Moon, or to head back to Earth itself. And the other advantage of it is that we can see how they handle longer and longer durations while we're near the Moon, with that same capability to do the abort. So, I think that's the real key there.  Host: Oh, I see. You can scale it up. You can do shorter -- kind of like what you're saying with Mars, where you have the option of shorter missions and longer missions. If you're talking about an Artemis mission, you could start shorter and then the whole point of Artemis here is to build a sustainable presence on the Moon, so as you continue to go back, just like Apollo, you could stay for longer and longer and longer. Now we're talking, you know, way longer than Apollo, but that would be a huge help to understanding how to live and work for long periods of time because that is the difference. To your point, that is the difference, is Mars is you would have to do it for a really, really, really long time.  Paul Kessler: That's right. You got it exactly right.  Host: Yeah. Unbelievable. So, tell me about some of these -- you were talking about contracts a little earlier on, you know, we're trying to investigate that with some contracts, we got people looking at this, that and the other thing. What are those things that right now that people are investigating for a Deep Space Transport and a Mars mission?  Paul Kessler: So, we have this contract mechanism called [Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships] NextSTEP, and it has different -- through that contract mechanism we've also been looking at getting contractors that have been bidding out for the Human Landing System for the Artemis mission, but in an earlier part of that contract there's this habitation that is meant for space. It can be meant for surfaces, it can also be meant for out in space itself as a transport vehicle, and we have a few contractors working on that, that are looking at systems that would be used for this transportation, this Mars transportation habitat, and then we have other things that they're looking at for the lunar surface itself. And what they're doing is they're taking a lot of their expertise and their knowledge and building habitats and they're doing some testing and some design, and they're using a lot of the -- the protocols or ground rules and assumptions, is what we call them, for doing a lot of that design, saying here's kind of the restrictions on what we should be looking at so that they're looking at the right stuff, without actually getting down into the detailed requirements. So, it's really early, prior to it becoming a full project yet, but it's an opportunity that avails us this ability to have more studies from the contractor's side, from their experience that they bring to bear to NASA, where we can learn some things about what this system might actually look like. And so those contractors are -- again, like I said before, they're building inflatable types of habitats, they're building modular type habitats that they would put together, and then they're showing us how they would put them up and what kind of operations they would do on them, what kind of risks they can see and identify, and what those things might look like in terms of costs and schedule, will it meet the cost and schedules that we're trying to fit within.  Host: Yeah. To your point, you know, you don't want to start writing requirements right now because your goal right now is to see what it would look like and you don't want to restrict very innovative ideas on what it could look like. So, just here's what we absolutely need, and then people come up with different solutions to fit those needs. So, there's this wide range of ideas and it helps you to pick down the best one. And maybe people can come up with ideas that maybe people haven't thought of before.  Paul Kessler: That's an excellent point. I think that's exactly what the whole purpose of the NextSTEP contract is.  Host: Yeah.  Paul Kessler: Is we want to see innovative ideas, we want to look at contractors and trust them as experts, and then we want to look at their concepts against what our NASA experts are saying and against our own reference systems that we design internally to say does this work, is there something missing, are there new ideas that are being brought to bear here that we could utilize in the future? And so, we've learned a lot of amazing things from these wonderful contractors that we've been working with, and I look forward to seeing even some more innovations that they can come up with.  Host: Well, let's talk about the range of ideas and people that are involved in this. You know, I think naturally when you're thinking about building a Deep Space Transport, people think that you have to be a rocket scientist to do anything, but I feel like there's a wider set of skills that are needed and a lot of help from all of these different people to really put this thing together. So who is helping out with designing this?  Paul Kessler: Well, I would say people like me, our systems analysts that are looking at this as an integrated picture. So it's one thing you could do systems analysis, which is really to assess what the overall goal of your system is and whether or not it's going to achieve that, whether it's going to be feasible or not, and this is to help those decision makers understand those systems to say this is the route I want to take based off of the risk posture that I want to take, or the costs or schedule, or things like that. And so, system analysis, like me, we might look at it from a side of -- like people within my office might look at it in terms of designing some trajectories that might be used that are going to optimally use propellent. Other people might design actual vehicles, like I'm doing, working with this Mars transit habitat to do the actual initial design that we can compare against contractors and look at. But we also want to look at the overall integrated picture, and I think it's really, really key and it could be lost in the weeds, especially when you talked about earlier, like if we go to requirements right away, we're going to stifle innovation. The same thing is that if we go to requirements too early, what ends up happening is we paint ourselves into a corner and now we're trying to get something to work for an overall bigger plan that's not going to work as well as we want it to. So, when I say campaign, what I'm talking about is if you were to think of each element, everything that we're going to put into space to get this overall thing accomplished. Let's say I want to go to Mars somewhere in the 2030s and I want to land on the surface, what all is involved, how do I get it there, what does it look like, how do I ensure that it's got the best chance, what's the feasibility, what's the risk, what's the cost to all of those kind of things? Those are important key parameters to helping our decision makers really know which direction we should be taking. So you want to look at it in an integrated level because if you, let's say, build a lander or an ascent vehicle that, let's say, and this is a simple example, doesn't have the same docking system that you have on the vehicle that's showing up, they're not going to be able to dock, and that's a problem. So we want to make sure that we are taking into consideration not just the individual level of let's say, the habitat or the propulsion system, but how does that propulsion system match up to the habitat, how does that habitat match up to this other system, and how do we keep it where it needs to be so that we can get to it.  Host: Yeah. It's the “devil's in the details,” as they say. You know, you talk about building a Deep Space Transport, but it's those little things that can sometimes make or break a mission, so thinking about them ahead of time is absolutely critical. Going forward to Artemis here, you know, we're talking about a transport to Mars and there's a lot of considerations for that distance, for that length of time that you have to think about. But what excites you about Artemis here? Because Artemis is, yeah, like you said, a little bit closer to home and we're trying to go quickly, we're trying to go soon. So, what excites you about things we can work on and learn during the Artemis program?  Paul Kessler: Well, I think it's really an exciting time to be in right now. I mean, our ability to not only explore just one destination, but then to really position ourselves to explore that second or third or fourth destination, wherever that might be, including Mars, is it's really, really exciting. I mean, this is -- it's been a long time since, I think, the United States and the world have gotten to have such inspirational motivation to explore. I mean, we have that real desire in us to understand the answers to the question why, and to understand about things. And we want to know, even just for the sake of knowing, but we also want to experience. I mean, life is about a lot of experience, and wonderful, beautiful experiences, and we want those experiences to reach the highest possible heights. Well, what's higher than going to space, right? And the Artemis mission, you get to go to space and then you get to go and land on the Moon. I mean, that's an amazing thing, and how can you not be excited about it? It's the new explorers, the new generation that's going to carry us into the future. You know, I was once told or I think read somewhere that, you know, if you're going to live, go on living, right. And that's what we got to do, we got to get out there and live. We got to make life worth living, and to make life worth living, one of those things is we can't just live off of just basic necessities. We've got to experience life in its overall grandiose beauty, and I think that's what's so exciting about this exploration that we're going to be doing to Mars, through Artemis, and doing that quickly. We're ambitious, we're trying to push the envelope, push forward and try to do that. I mean, it's inspirational, right. We've seen a lot of these things. I think a lot of people have grown up, especially nowadays, where you see all these superhero movies or you see “Star Wars” or you see “Star Trek,” or you see all these wonderful movies that are inspirational to so many, and they're like, “but why aren't we doing that,” right? We want to live that life. We want to experience life more, and I think this is an opportunity to do that.  Host: Paul, that's beautifully said. It is truly an exciting time and, you know, I'm looking forward to being a part of a generation where I can say that I, you know, see moonwalkers, I see people walking on the Moon, and then hopefully people taking those first steps on the Martian surface. Man, what an exciting time it would be to be alive during that.  Paul Kessler: Oh, yeah.  Host: Yeah. Absolutely. Paul, I appreciate your time going through the detailed description of what we're looking for, for a Deep Space Transport. I can't wait to see some of the designs and ways this is going to be put together and to get people on it, on the way to Mars. I appreciate all you do. Thanks, Paul.  Paul Kessler: Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity to tell you and your listeners all about it.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.

        description: "Production Transcript for Ep24_Space Habitat.mp3     [00:00:00] >> Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 24, Space Habitats.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  So on this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know all the coolest information that's going on right here at NASA.  So today we're talking about the space habitat analog that we have here at the NASA Johnson Space Center called, The Human Exploration Research Analog, or HERA, with Lisa Spence and Paul Haugen.  Here in Houston, Lisa is the Flight Analog's Project Manager for HERA, and Paul is the HERA Operations Engineer.  They work with the people who actually stay in HERA, this analog, and simulate deep-space missions for days, weeks, and now more than a month.  And actually, just recently, the campaign for Mission 3 this year just got out, and they're going to be going home for the holidays, and speaking of which, happy holidays to all of you, whether you celebrate Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, whatever, happy holidays, and I'm glad to see that the campaign for Mission 3 crew members are going to be going home too.   [00:01:06] But here with Lisa and Paul, we had a great discussion about HERA, what it is, what it's like inside, what crew members do on missions, what we're learning, and then how to sign up for those missions.  So with no further delay, let's go lightspeed and jump right ahead to our talk with Miss Lisa Spence and Dr. Paul Haugen.  Enjoy!    [00:01:23] [ Music ]  You were part of the crew that was in there during, like, right before Harvey hit, or something?    [00:01:52] >> Yep, yep.  So we were halfway through when Harvey hit [laughing], so.    [00:01:55] >> Wow!  Halfway through.  How -- how long of a mission?    [00:01:58] >> It's a 45-day mission, so.    [00:02:00] >> Okay.    [00:02:00] >> So we were on day 23 when we got kicked out, so [laughing].    [00:02:04] >> Wow.  So by that time, were you pretty much immersed in...    [00:02:07] >> Oh yeah.    [00:02:08] >> ...in like the whole environment.    [00:02:09] >> Oh yeah, yeah.    [00:02:10] >> And then, all of a sudden, oh, by the way, you're back on earth and there's a hurricane?    [00:02:14] >> It was weird.  I mean, we were very much immersed and we got woken up, they have an emergency com [phonetic] for just stuff like this, and we were in a com delay, so our normal com, you know, was -- already had a, you know, delay going on, but we got called on the emergency radio and said, pack it up, you guys are kicked out, so.    [00:02:35] >> That's it?  It was just, alright, well, we're done, we got to go!  So, was -- because at the end, I know there's like usually a ceremony, right, and they do this whole thing where you come out.  It was just, alright, you guys get out.    [00:02:47] >> Yep.  They had -- all the gates were closed, so they had to specially open up a gate to get us out, because they were flooded.  I mean...    [00:02:53] >> Woah!    [00:02:54] >> Yeah.    [00:02:55] >> [Laughing] Wait, so, when did you -- what was the day that you guys were out?  We got kicked out on August 27th, so that Sunday morning.  So it was right in the middle of all the flooding and stuff.    [00:03:08] >> Well, okay, so I -- I live up in the city, and, by far, the worst -- the worst night was Sunday night, but I think Saturday night into Sunday night was pretty bad.    [00:03:16] >> Saturday night was the worst one.    [00:03:18] >> For here?  Down in JSC?    [00:03:19] >> Yeah.    [00:03:19] >> Oh, wow!    [00:03:20] >> Oh, big time.  Yeah, yeah.  They got just hammered.    [00:03:24] >> Wow!  So what happened to the HERA facility?    [00:03:27] >> It was fine.    [00:03:28] >> Really?    [00:03:28] >> So we -- we were fine inside, but mission control, those guys were having trouble getting in and out of -- of Johnson Space Center, and they -- so there was a concern for them that we had to call it short.    [00:03:42] >> Wow.  I know for -- they had to set up a lot of cots and everything for people to -- to go back and, you know, once they were done, they just slept in the back rooms or something.    [00:03:51] >> Well, in building 30, yeah, but so we have our own mission control.    [00:03:55] >> You're talking about HERA mission control?    [00:03:56] >> The HERA mission control, and so those folks were having trouble getting in and out, and -- and they were getting stuck in flood waters and stuff.  So it was concern for them that we had to call the mission.  Yeah, because we -- inside HERA, we were fine.  We -- frankly, we had no idea.    [00:04:11] >> And you're right, they closed the gates.  So, on top of all the flood waters, you know, you had -- you couldn't even get in.    [00:04:17] >> Yep, yep.    [00:04:17] >> Wow.  Alright.  [Laughter] Quite an experience!  Are you going back then?    [00:04:22] >> Nope, that's it.    [00:04:23] >> That's it?    [00:04:23] >> I mean, it was -- it was fun, but now I know too much so they won't let me go back and be a subject [laughing].    [00:04:30] >> Oh, that's right.  Because you actually experienced it.  Okay, well let's -- well let's pill back then, because that was an awesome story.  Let's pull back and just talk about, you know, what is HERA?    [00:04:38] >> Sure, okay.    [00:04:39] >> So, we're talking about space habitats, and it's really a simulator for what it would be like, right, to live in a deep space environment.  Is that -- is that kind of right?    [00:04:50] >> Close.  So it's -- it's not actually a simulator, and that's a -- it's a -- that's a word that gets used quite a bit, but it's a little inaccurate, so it's not -- it's not actually a simulator, it allows us to simulate what it's like, and the difference is that, I mean, is -- there's a fidelity difference.  So, what this allows us to do is to simulate that we are in a deep space mission and -- and we're isolated, we're confined, and we're controlled.  And by controlled I mean so they are constantly monitoring us with cameras and audio and we are wearing all sorts of different equipment to measure various biomarkers or whatever the case may be, and -- and then there's a mission control.  So they are -- it's very controlled what they allow in and out of HERA.  So it's a very, very controlled environment, and so that's -- and so by being -- by allowing us to simulate what it's like to be, then they can do all sorts of various studies and they can tweak this little part here to see how that will affect things, or -- or not, so.    [00:06:03] >> Okay, so instead of a simulator, what do they -- what do they call HERA then?    [00:06:07] >> An analog.    [00:06:08] >> Analog, okay.  So what's an analog?    [00:06:10] >> So an analog is kind of what I was describing.  So it's -- it's a -- it's an environment that, in our case, there's two main types of analogs.  There's a -- there's an isolated and confined and controlled analog, and then there's one that's more of an extreme environment that's not as controlled.  So -- so there's not as much monitoring, there's not as much knowing what goes in and out, but it's more of a harsh environment, such as Antartica or Nemo, which is an underwater analog.  So there's two main types of analogs, the one here, HERA, is -- is the -- is the controlled environment.  So it's the isolated control, confined and controlled environment.    [00:06:55] >> Okay, and what's the significance of those two segments?  Like the controlled environment and then the extreme environment?    [00:07:01] >> Sure.  So the controlled one allows you to do specific scientific studies and really control what's going on, right?  So it really allows you to baseline and to -- and to change certain parameters that really allow you to see how that is going to affect various things, and you're very much isolated and controlled that way, whereas more of an extreme one, it's not nearly -- there's a lot more variables that are not controlled, and so it's harder to set up specific types of scientific experiments, maybe.  However, there's the added part of being an extreme environment.  So there's actual really, you know, physical risk.  You know, if there's an issue in Antartica, you cannot just open up the door and walk out and be okay and go to the doctor, I mean, you're -- you're in a rough environment, same with Nemo.  I mean, you can't just open up the door and, I mean, you're 60 feet underwater, so...    [00:08:02] >> Yeah, because Nemo -- yeah, Nemo is the habitat that's literally underwater, and you're right, you can't -- you can't open up the door, because -- because you're so deep underwater, it's not even just getting out and splashing up, like, there's a whole sequence of -- of getting...    [00:08:14] >> And there's real, you know, real danger.    [00:08:16] >> But the whole -- but that's the purpose, right?  Is you're putting them in an environment because the -- the imminent danger is supposed to help with imminent danger in space, right?    [00:08:26] >> That's correct.  So, you're -- you're adding that stressor that is -- is a real stressor.  I mean, you know, technically, I suppose that T38 could be considered a type of an analog, because, you know, it's a -- it's a, you know, they use it as a trainer, but they do that because there's real risk involved and there's a real operational experience.  Whereas, you know, HERA, I mean, you know, a person knows that you can open the door and step out.  Now, that being said, after day 2, it, you know, we were really quite immersed.  I mean, we were -- I mean, you have that in the back of your head, that you can open the door and step out, but -- but you forget about it and you really become immersed in the mission.  So -- so it's not as big of a player is what I would have originally thought maybe.    [00:09:17] >> Yeah.    [00:09:17] >> I mean, I was surprised how quickly I was able to get immersed in the mission and -- and forget that I was, I mean, obviously, I knew I wasn't in space, because I wasn't floating around or anything like that, but I -- but I, you know, I got immersed in the mission, and that happened much, much more than I would have guessed and much quicker than I would have guessed.    [00:09:36] >> Yeah, because one of the main objectives of HERA, right, is -- is the human research component, is understanding what goes through, I guess, well, I guess, psychology is one component, but then there's other components too for the human research aspect?    [00:09:51] >> Yeah, so, actually, psychology, that's probably the largest component, because they're looking at the isolation aspect and that type of thing, and how four crew members operate together, and in our case, I mean, we're total strangers.  So, but the -- but then there also is more, you know, there's physiological studies and -- and other principal investigators that look at other aspects as well, but probably the -- the psych docs are the biggest components of the studies.    [00:10:22] >> Yeah, I guess the psychology and then -- is there a team component too, because you said, like, you -- that you're working with some strangers, but do they select you because you're compatible with these strangers or incompatible?    [00:10:35] >> Oh, well, [laughing].  So -- so they -- so the people that select the crew, so there's -- there's criteria they want.  There's an age range, they want 30 to 57, I think it is, and they want at least a master's, and they want it in a technical field, and they, you know, so, there's different criteria like that, but then beyond that, you know, there's -- and there's a physical you have to pass, and there's psych screening that you have to pass, but beyond that, so the people that are selecting the crew, they look at personalities, and they look to see, is this crew going to be compatible?  And they are not trying to pick a crew to fail, they are picking one to succeed.  So they are picking crew members that they think will -- will work well together.  And knowing that, you know, maybe one or two or three or four, maybe all of them, are going to have some quirks, like we all do I guess, I mean, that -- so maybe they're not going to work, you know, person A and B are not going to work as well as person C and D together, but they'll still be good enough to get the job done.    [00:11:39] >> Yeah.    [00:11:39] >> So they definitely look at that.    [00:11:41] >> Alright.  So, it's getting these group of people to test, you know, all of these human aspects of -- of putting together a mission, and the mission is -- is what?  What are you simulating in the analog?    [00:11:56] >> So our mission, this year, so this -- this year is -- is simulating going to an asteroid and collecting samples at the asteroid.  It's a 715 day mission or something like that.    [00:12:12] >> Wow.    [00:12:13] >> That they, you know, shrink down to 45 days.    [00:12:16] >> Okay, so you're -- you're in there for 45 days, but pretending to be in there for...?    [00:12:20] >> That's correct.  So, you know, future ones may be going to the moon, maybe going to Mars, something like that, but -- so, but it's, the purpose for HERA is a deep space mission.  So it's not just going up to ISS or anything like that, but it's extended exploration into deep space.    [00:12:41] >> And is the deep space mission in this analog, right?  Which is simulating that if you were to go in a -- in a mission profile, just like this, you would have this habitat that you would be in, and that you would live and work in for a simulated two-ish years or whatever, but really it's 45 days, obviously.  So what are -- what -- what's the lay of the land inside of HERA?  What -- what's the full, I guess, the plan?  Yeah, the blueprint for HERA?    [00:13:12] >> The floor plan?  Yeah.  So, they try to keep it, you know, similar to what they think, you know, a deep space vehicle would be, you know, volume wise.  Obviously, the difference here is we're in 1G, so -- so we can't live on the roof or the -- or the walls or anything like that.    [00:13:33] >> Oh, that's right.    [00:13:34] >> But, so the general layout of the -- there's two and a half levels, [chuckling] I guess you could say.  So the bottom level, there's a tiny airlock, and we use that for simulated EVAs and stuff like that.  There's the main part, down on the first floor, and that has, you know, workstations or different simulators that we'll work on and stuff.  Lab desks, and -- and then there's also a hygiene module.  So there's a bathroom, a shower, a sink and stuff like that.  The -- the second level is -- that's more of the quote, unquote living space maybe, that's where the -- the food galley is, so that's where the kitchen is, where we'll cook, prepare foods, that -- we would do -- there's some workstations up there, as well.  There's workout areas for -- whether it's an exercise bike or weights or whatever, and then the half level that I was talking about, it's actually a level three, but -- and those are the sleeping quarters.   [00:14:46] And so those are roughly the size of a twin bed.  So they're fairly small.  And they are -- and that's all that's up there, so it's -- it's just the sleeping quarters.    [00:14:58] >> Alright.  Hey, thanks for joining us, Lisa, I'm sorry.    [00:15:00] >> Glad to be here!    [00:15:01] >> I know you're very busy, especially because there's -- there's a mission going on right now, right?    [00:15:06] >> Yes, there is.  We are actually on day 19 of 45.  So, yes, we're -- we're getting there.  We're getting there.    [00:15:15] >> Well, Paul was -- we started with Paul talking about his part of a mission, because of -- because of the whole Harvey thing, but now we were just going through the -- the sort of layout of HERA and -- and living and working, I guess, but there's -- it's two and half levels you said, and there's living, you know, there's a living component, sleeping component, and it's -- it's just this whole confined area, right?  It's -- is it self-contained?    [00:15:40] >> It's pretty much self-contained, it's -- it's not -- it's not hermetically sealed, so it is getting air exchanged from the outside.  We don't have an active environmental control and life support system.  You know, we have plumbing that's provided by the facility, but -- but it is self-contained.  So once we close the doors to start a mission, those doors stay closed until 45 days later when the crew triumphantly emerges from -- from the HERA and gets to reunite with friends and family.    [00:16:13] >> That's true.  Or quickly emerges, in Paul's case I guess.    [00:16:16] >> Yeah, that was a -- that was a bit unfortunate [laughter].    [00:16:20] >> Well, he said, even in that short amount of time, he got immersed, right?  You got immersed into the environment, and you were living it.  Right?  So what was that like living it then?  What was -- you know, what -- what state of mind were you in in order to, you know, to think that you're in space?  That you were operating in a -- in a space habitat?    [00:16:40] >> So -- so, again, I don't quite know how to describe it, because, I mean, so -- so, you know, we knew that we weren't in space, for example, but I get -- maybe it started with training.  I mean, the trainers did such a good job explaining the importance of what we're doing and why we're doing it, and -- and how important it is to get in that mindset, and so just going in purposely with that mindset, it -- I guess it just kind of came naturally then after that, and -- and we got into a routine and, you know, we -- we kept incredibly busy, you know we had -- it was partly a sleep deprivation going on, so we had long work days and they just kept us busy doing tasks all day, and -- and it really -- I suppose that was part of it too, just keeping us busy and going -- constantly going, you know, that helped us to -- to get in there.    [00:17:42] >> So on top of the 45 days, there's a prepping component too?    [00:17:46] >> Oh yeah.    [00:17:47] >> How early are you starting to -- to prep the crew members for their stay?    [00:17:50] >> So the training, for these 45 day missions, the training starts 16 days before they're going to go in.  So, it's -- we were finding that two weeks was just a little bit cramped, and even 16 days may be a little cramped.  Because as -- as Paul said, we keep them really, really busy during the timeframe that they're in there.  And so some of that is on the more operational tasks.  So, you know, the kinds of activities and tasks that you would do as you are flying your spacecraft to this destination.  And then, of course, the activities that you're going to do at destination and then the return.  But they're also engaged in all of the scientific investigations that -- that we are doing where we're collecting the data that will ultimately inform some decisions that we'll be making, you know, in order to keep our crew members safe and healthy and happy and productive as they're going on those really long duration exploration missions.  So -- so there is -- there is that training component that's up front.   [00:18:54] We're also collecting some data that we used as our baseline data that can then be compared to, well, what are the effects, you know?  So now we have these individuals, we get some baseline information, now we subject them to this -- this isolated, confined, and controlled environment for 45 days.  You know, what is that effect?  What changes?  And can we detect those kinds of changes?  And then, ultimately, will we be able to mitigate those changes if they're not healthy or productive?    [00:19:23] >> Alright.  So there's, I mean, 16 days, that's a pretty jam-packed kind of schedule to prep for all of that sort of training.  What kind of -- what's the type of training you're getting, I guess it depends on what you're doing on board, so I guess the follow up would be, what are you doing on board?    [00:19:39] >> So, I'm not quite sure how detailed we can get, because we can't spill the beans for future stuff.    [00:19:47] >> That's right, because you want people to sign up to do more missions.    [00:19:49] >> We do!    [00:19:50] >> Okay!    [00:19:50] >> It's critically important that -- that we're able to find, you know, suitable volunteers, you know, people who, to a large degree, mimic or emulate the type of people that we select for astronauts.  So that's very important to us.  But, you know, some of the types of things that they do, you know, we have a lot of simulators.  And so they're flying a simulator for their spacecraft.  They're participating in virtual reality EVAs.  So they do spacewalks that they're all in virtual reality.  There's prep work that needs to go with all of that.  There's also a simulator that is like a robotic arm trainer.  And -- and those are what we -- some of the operational tasks, so the operational tasks do allow us to collect some data, as well.  They have to cook their food [laughter].  Yeah, there's -- there's, you know, there's no, you know, mom or dad or -- or spouse or whatever to cook the meals for you, so they do have to cook their own food.   [00:20:56] It's all food from -- for this current mission, this series of missions, all of the food is from the food lab at JSC.  The same food that the astronauts are getting on board the International Space Station, which means that it's either prepackaged, it's dehydrated, or it's those meals ready to eat that you just kind of warm up in a little warming oven, and every single package of food has to be individually fixed.  So it takes time.  There's a serial process.  They get to do a lot of exercise, and then, you know, of course, any self-respecting spacecraft, you're going to have to do a little bit of onboard training, you're going to have to do some maintenance and housekeeping tasks.  We also have to practice some emergency procedures just in case an emergency were to happen.  And so -- so, you know, the team, my team, comes up with, you know, a very intensive scenario for the spacecraft mission itself, and then we weave in the -- all of the different scientific investigations.    [00:22:12] >> Alright [laughing].  So, do you have to make up different ones every time or is it -- do they sort of translate?  The emergency scenarios?    [00:22:21] >> So there's a wide variety of things that they run you through and stuff like that, and, you know, all of those things, you know, they need to train you in 16 days prior, because, as Lisa said, I mean, if -- if you don't know how to do something, it's not like they're going to open the door and show you how to do it.  So they -- you need to know how to do all of the operational tasks, all of the scientific studies, how the vehicle works, how the HERA works, in those 16 days.  So -- so the training is quite intensive, as well.  They -- they really cram it with [inaudible] and that stuff.    [00:22:59] >> Sounds like it!  Is there a lot of autonomy with the way that you're doing these tasks?  Or do you have some support from -- from a simulated mission control?    [00:23:07] >> Well, so mission control is always there.  So they're -- they're 24/7.  And they are always there to answer questions or -- or whatever the case.  So you always have that support.  There's, honestly, I think it depends, it varies from crew to crew and crew member to crew member how autonomous a person or a crew will -- wants to be.    [00:23:29] >> Oh!    [00:23:30] >> So MCC is always there, but some crews, or some people, may be a little more autonomous than others.    [00:23:36] >> So is that one of the things you're looking at, Lisa, is trying to see, you know, what -- what things people can do by themselves and what, you know, about autonomy and what you need to support?    [00:23:47] >> Yep, absolutely.  Some of the research is looking at those levels of autonomy, and so, yes, MCC is there 24/7.  Sometimes they're more there than at other times.  But one of the other things that happens during the mission is, you know, we're -- we're simulating a mission to an asteroid.  You're getting really, really, really far away from earth over the course of the mission.  So as you get further away from the earth, there's a calm delay.  And so you don't -- when you say something to mission control, it may take, you know, anywhere from an additional 30 seconds to 5 minutes before they hear what you said.  And then, of course, when they respond, it's going to take that same 30 seconds to 5 minutes before you hear it.  So if you're the crew member on board, and you have a question, and you ask MCC a question, it's at least 10 minutes, worst case, it's at least 10 minutes before you get a response.   [00:24:54] And so what we find is that sometimes the crew members will have to wait for the response, and sometimes the crew members just get to the point where they're like, hey, we don't need no stinking mission control [laughter], we can figure this out by ourselves, because we're not going to hear back from them anytime real soon.  So we do see some -- some trending towards increased autonomy.  As we move forward with, not this particular research campaign, but future research campaigns, autonomy will become more and more important from a -- from a research perspective.  So, mission control will always be there 24/7 to some degree, because that's a -- that's a safety requirement to make sure that we have, you know, that everybody is going to, you know, be able to implement the mission safely, no issues, no problems, but in terms of how much interaction the crew members might have with the mission control, that may be scaled back in -- in future research campaigns to sort of force that autonomy and to -- to really be able to determine, you know, if there are tasks that can and should be done that way, or if there are things that ought not to be done so autonomously.    [00:26:21] >> So is that kind of depending on the mission profile?  So you're doing a mission profile to an asteroid now.  Maybe with -- once you get to Mars, those can take 20-something minute one-way trip.  You're talking about not getting a response for 40 minutes!  So, autonomy is definitely something that needs to be built into the tasks for -- for that kind of mission, right?    [00:26:44] >> Absolutely.  And -- and with the autonomy, we'll probably come and need to revisit how we're doing training, how much training we can do, how long it's going to take to do the training, and whether we need to move some of that training inside the module after the mission starts.  I'm not talking about us coming in and -- and setting up our little genie workshop, you know, it would be some type of onboard training, maybe some uplink video or something along those lines, but our simulator does have the capability of doing that 20 minute voice delay.  We just -- we don't need it for the current -- current set of missions, but if we change our scenario, and as we change our scenario to -- to a Mars-based scenario, we could certainly implement that longer -- longer-term comm delay.    [00:27:39] >> Wow.  So, Paul, did you have to live this comm delay?    [00:27:43] >> Yep.    [00:27:43] >> You did?    [00:27:44] >> Yeah, we were -- so we were on day 23.  So we were at the 5-minute, one-way comm delays, so.    [00:27:50] >> Alright.  So how did that affect your work from, you know, how did that progress?    [00:27:55] >> You know, frankly, I -- I didn't really notice any difference other than having to be a little more careful about what -- looking ahead more in whatever task we were working on, and saying, oh, I need to interact with MCC here, I'm going to make the call as soon as I possibly can, and kind of lining it up that way.  But really, I mean, it wasn't as huge an impact.  I think, you know, one or two of the crew members would probably say otherwise, you know, I think it was a little more of an impact, but, you know, then one or two of us, you know, I don't think it was a huge impact, so.    [00:28:39] >> So is that some of the stuff you're finding, Lisa?  Is that some of this stuff is not universal, right?  It kind of is a little bit more crew-dependent.    [00:28:47] >> It certainly is.  And you had asked the question a little while ago about, you know, whether some of the tasks that we do, if we create them new for every mission?  Actually what we do is we -- we have a suite of scientific investigations that we're -- we're implementing right now.  We will implement those scientific investigations for all four of the missions that will run within that, we call it a campaign.  Each one of the missions in that campaign is as identical as we can make it from a mission control, from a timeline standpoint, the variable in how the mission is executed really comes down to the individuals who are our crew members inside.  And, you know, we say it a little bit tongue-in-cheek, and it's -- it's really true, every single crew is different.  You know, every crew is special, they're different, they're unique.   [00:29:50] How these four individuals mold into a crew.  It's different every single time, and then, of course, the -- the four individuals acting as individuals, that's different every time as well.  So, it -- it really -- you know, when I abstract myself out of, you know, the actual execution of the mission and I look at it kind of more in an aggregate viewpoint, it's just fun to -- to see the variability between individuals.    [00:30:24] >> Absolutely!  That's just good science, right?  Doing it the same, and then you just see the differences between exactly what you want to study, which is the people, right?    [00:30:32] >> That's what we're hoping for, yes.    [00:30:35] >> Alright.    [00:30:36] >> And that's one thing that's very unique.  You know, we had talked earlier about the different types of analogs, and that's one thing that is very unique, I think, to HERA, is that we are able to -- to cookie cutter four missions and have them as identical as they possibly can be, and have 16 subjects, or 16 guinea pigs or whatever, that we are -- can use for that scientific data.  That is, you know, probably more unique to our analog than -- than to some others.    [00:31:07] >> Alright.  So backing up from there.  16, you're talking about 4 mission per year, right?  So 4 missions of 4 crew members.    [00:31:15] >> Correct.    [00:31:16] >> And this year, I guess, was the 45-day mission.    [00:31:19] >> Yes.    [00:31:19] >> So where did it start and how has it evolved?    [00:31:22] >> So the HERA, this is only our fourth year of operations.  So this is campaign four.  It started, I guess, in, you know, 2012, 2013, with seven-day missions.  So pretty short, you know, but, you know, that's -- it's a good place to start.  And then the following year, we went to 14-day missions.  So we doubled, which is pretty exciting!  And then the third year, so campaign three, last year, we did four 30-day missions.  So we doubled again.  Now, if you do the math, we couldn't continue to double the duration of the mission and still get four missions executed in, you know, roughly a year's period of time.  So, we -- we worked very, very closely with our -- our scientific community, the stakeholders in all of this, and, well, yeah, they -- they certainly want those longer duration missions, they kind of determined that 45 days is a duration that is -- is very beneficial to them, and so we -- we can do the four 45-day missions in roughly a year.   [00:32:41] As long as we don't get Harvey'd.  [Laughter] Harvey -- Harvey sort of threw a monkey wrench into the whole process this year.    [00:32:49] >> Oh, that's right.  So what number was your mission, Paul?  Was it number three of four?    [00:32:53] >> We were actually number two.    [00:32:55] >> Number two?  Okay.  So you got -- you have two completed 45-day missions, right, and you're on the last one?  Or is it -- did the schedule kind of get messed up?    [00:33:05] >> The schedule got a little bit wonky.  I guess the technical term that we use for wonky.  So, Paul's mission was the second, and it got Harvey'd.  So truncated at 23 days.  And so we're -- we're currently in the middle of our third mission.    [00:33:22] >> I see.    [00:33:23] >> So, again, you kind of have to, you know, we had to do all the recovery, of course, from -- from Harvey, and then, you know, we already had this third mission scheduled for a specific time.  We'd recruited subjects, and so we can't just, you know, move the schedule around, you know, to fill up the white space that was created by the shortened mission.  So -- so this is the third mission.  Our fourth mission will start in the January timeframe.    [00:33:52] >> Alright.  So you mentioned that the 45-day mission was kind of like a 700 and something, what was the number again?    [00:34:00] >> I think it was 715 or something like that.    [00:34:03] >> 715 day mission collapsed into 45, just because 715 would be a lot to ask of someone.    [00:34:11] >> In terms of a time warp.  [Laughter]    [00:34:15] >> So how -- so how has the mission design changed for, because there was a 7-day mission, right?  Did you -- did you condense the 715 day mission to 7 days?    [00:34:24] >> We used a slightly different scenario during the -- the 7 and 14 day missions, but, yeah, they do get compressed or condensed fairly significantly.  The 45-day mission, obviously, means that we don't have to compress it quite so much, but as -- as we move on, we are looking at different kinds of scenarios, and, you know, so we may -- we may use a different compression factor just depending on what kind of mission profile we choose to fly for future campaigns.    [00:34:56] >> So what was the 7-day mission?  Was it out to an asteroid or was it somewhere else?    [00:34:59] >> I believe it was to an asteroid.  I actually came onto the project at the tail end of the 14-day missions, actually, I think they were already over by the time I came onto the project.  So -- so I've really only been the project manager, you know, for the end of that campaign, and then all of the third and the fourth campaign.  And now planning for campaign five.    [00:35:23] >> Alright!    [00:35:24] >> Yes, it's very exciting!    [00:35:25] >> So what's -- what's coming up then?  Do you -- do you want to preview?    [00:35:29] >> For campaign five?    [00:35:30] >> Yeah!    [00:35:30] >> I mean, it's going to be, you know, the same type of thing, where they'll be a deep space exploration mission, you know, to a destination of some type, and it'll be, you know, they'll be operational -- it'll be laid out the same, it'll be a different scenario, but it'll be the same type of something, so operational tasks, scientific tasks, they'll be looking at, you know, psychological aspects and autonomy and -- and possibly some physiological, again, but -- but the -- it'll be laid out similar.  So, again, they'll be four missions, you know, as identical as can possibly be with four crews a piece, so.    [00:36:16] >> And they will be 45 day missions.  So, for the foreseeable future, you know, all of our campaigns, as far as we know, the research community is requesting us to continue with the 45-day missions.  So, for campaign five, we -- we will have a different suite of scientific investigations.  Some of the investigations that we're currently doing will carry over, and then we also have some new investigations that we'll be executing for the first time in campaign five.  So -- so, there's -- there's a lot of work that needs to be done with that.  The -- the investigations themselves, often times, will drive the types of operational activities that my team develops.  So, for instance, you know, one particular research investigation may be looking at crew interactions.  And so we might want to develop some operational tasks that would force a couple of crew members with working together, and maybe force different combinations of the four crew members working together, maybe, you know, two working together, three working together, or even tasks that would require all four.   [00:37:36] And so, as we get into -- we're just getting ready to kick off all of that activity, but as we get into kind of into the guts of the individual scientific investigations, that will help us determine what scenario is going to work best, what kind of activities will we need to do, how intensive are some of the data collection activities that we need to do, how is that going to impact laying things out on a mission timeline?  All of those things kind of get rolled up into a whole lot of work that a small number of people will do in what seemingly is an incredibly short amount of time.    [00:38:21] >> Alright.  Well, it sounds like there's not a lot of spoilers that you can give for what's coming up and -- but is there -- is there some high level stuff that you can share about what you've learned so far and how that's going to be put into deep space missions for actually, you know, for human spaceflight in the future?    [00:38:37] >> You know, you're kind of touching on an area that, for me, was one of the neatest aspects of -- of being on the crew, and that was -- was having the folks doing the training amplifying the fact that this is needed for -- for real deep space missions.  So this type of research, the questions that are being asked, and the answers that they're trying to find are needed before we can ever hope to go to deep space.  And so that aspect is -- is pretty neat.  You know, there's -- there's -- all of the questions I think that we've already been touching on as far as what types of questions they need to answer.  You know, the autonomy, the crew composition, the [pause] different -- how busy do the crew need to be on, you know, if they're going for 9 months to Mars, how busy do they need to be during that time?   [00:39:42] Or can they just have nothing to do all day for nine months?  I mean, so there's all sorts of different questions that -- that need to be answered and they're trying to answer now.  I think, you know, I think a lot of the studies, because they do roll from year to year, I think a lot of it hasn't been published yet and been fully analyzed, so I think -- I think, Lisa will know better, but I think we're just starting to get to the point where they're starting to maybe publish some of the work now from the past four years.    [00:40:10] >> So more to come.    [00:40:11] >> Yeah, absolutely more to come.  And -- and Paul's absolutely right.  A lot of the studies that we saw in earlier campaigns, they do have a tendency to roll forward.  About half of the studies in any given campaign tend to move forward, and some of them have -- have been implemented or plan to be implemented in two or three, maybe even more, research campaigns.  So it -- it gives the researchers a lot of -- a lot of N, you know, that scientific validity, but the researchers are also being -- making some slight modifications to how they're doing their research based on what they're seeing.  That doesn't mean that they have the answers or that they have published those answers, but they can kind of see, you know, trends in what is -- what is going on.  So, I think it will be very exciting.  One of the things that the human research program does every year, they have an investigator's workshop that happens at the end of January, it's down in Galveston.   [00:41:21] We invite all of the researchers who are being funded through the humean research program to come and talk about their research, yo uknow, and whether that is talking about what their research is, you know, for instance, if they don't have any results yet or haven't crunched all the numbers, if you will, or whether they have preliminary results or, you know, if they're just in the planning stage for that next experiment.  But it -- it really, I think we are now at the point where the 2018 investigator workshop is -- is really going to start, we're really going to start hearing about some of the results that investigators, participating in HERA over the last three years, have -- what they found.    [00:42:11] >> Wow!    [00:42:12] >> I know!  It's great!    [00:42:14] >> That's cool!  So, HERA is mostly human study, right?  It's mostly the human aspect.  Is there some components of designing a mission or the layout of a space habitat or is it really just focusing on the human part?    [00:42:29] >> No, I think you touch on an important aspect.  So, I mean, you know, there's -- whether it's procedures or even equipment or whatever that -- that sometimes, you know, groups will want to vet or check out in an analog such as HERA.  So -- so there's -- there's most definitely other aspects of -- of what analogs are useful for, and -- and can be used for.    [00:42:55] >> Definitely.    [00:42:55] >> And mission planning too like you stated, as well.  So, yeah.    [00:42:59] >> Even on the International Space Station right now, too, they -- they have, you know, they have conferences for, like medical conferences that are private because, you know, you need to keep that stuff confidential, but then also in case anything's wrong, you can talk to a psychologist, and then you can talk to your family too, so you're in constant communication with them, you're in constant communication with the ground, you don't feel isolated, you know, all of these things on the International Space Station, as well, and I'm sure HERA too has some human elements, but all of this can be translated out to deep space.  So, Paul, take me through like, I don't know, without, you know, much spoilers, what's like a typical day in -- on the -- in HERA.    [00:43:39] >> You wake up at 7.  [Laughter]    [00:43:42] >> Yep, wake up at 7, you know, you -- you don all of your equipment, which takes a fair amount of time, I mean, there's all sorts of different measurements that -- that they're taking, so, you don that stuff, you eat breakfast, and then you begin your day.  So, there's -- whether it's -- and the days vary, so it's not the same everyday.  So, whether it's, you know, some of the simulator that Lisa was describing earlier or some of the other various tasks -- tasks, and, you know, generally we do them throughout the morning, you know, lunch would be later, typically, and we had a sleep deprivation going on, like I was stating.  So, we eat later, in, you know, mid-afternoon, and then continue on with tasks until evening.  And evening would roll around and we would, you know, obviously eat supper then, and -- and then we would have a little bit of downtime, and, you know, we had to be sure that we stayed awake until certain -- you know, so they were monitoring that pretty closely.   [00:44:49] But, so -- but the days were surprising, I mean, the time was absolutely flying by.  I mean, it felt like we had been in there about 5 days and it was 23.  I mean, it felt like we were in the first week.  So, it was really going by fast.    [00:45:07] >> Did you -- was your sense of time off, because you're not really seeing the sun rise and set, right?    [00:45:13] >> Yeah, yeah, I suppose it was.  You know, yeah, I think so.  You know, that was a little weird not seeing the sun ever [laughter], but -- but, yeah, you know, yeah, I guess, you know, I didn't find myself getting hungry until lunch at 3 o'clock or whatever it was, you know, I mean, later in the day, and supper we were eating late, but -- but it didn't seem like that.  It didn't seem like we were working these extended, long days, it seemed like -- like just a normal day.  I mean, so the days were going by fast, and the -- the time itself was going by pretty fast.    [00:45:50] >> Wow.  So you wouldn't let Paul go to sleep, huh?    [00:45:54] >> No.  No, everybody had to stay awake.  So with the -- the study that's going on, the -- the awake time is 19 hours, and then the sleep time is 5 hours, that's only Monday through Friday, you get to sleep in a bit on the weekend.  So you do get a break on the weekend, sort of reset.  And -- and for some individuals, the fact that there is a weekend and -- and the schedule's a little bti different, that might help people mark time, but, yeah, the absence of all of those external queues.  We do find that -- that the crew members lose track a little bit of time.  Now you had a very special guest inside -- inside the HERA.    [00:46:39] >> We did.    [00:46:40] >> You had Wilson.  And so, that goes back to the movie, I guess, Castaway, right?    [00:46:47] >> Alright!    [00:46:48] >> Now, as I recall from that movie, and it has been a long time, he kind of marked off the number of days, but he was able to see the sun rise and the sun set to keep track of how many days he'd been on that desert island, but I didn't observe this crew marking off the days, they just had Wilson as their companion.    [00:47:08] >> Actually we did.  So we had on -- there was a little whiteboard that we designated and we'd written out the calendar, or, you know, the mission days, and that was one of the highlights.  So at the end of the day, we would go down and X off what day we had finished, and...    [00:47:22] >> Like an advent calendar.    [00:47:24] >> Yep, that's exactly what it was like!  And we -- we marked where, you know, the halfway point, we marked when the comm delays would start.  You know, kind of all of the big, exciting things.  When we'd reach the destination and how long we'd be there.  We -- we blocked that off.  So -- so, we were -- we were checking the days off, but that was kind of a -- I mean, it was, you know, exciting to who's turn it was to check off the date [laughing], so.    [00:47:49] >> So that was something that your crew sort of just kept track of, right?  It wasn't assigned to you, it was just, so was it like a team building thing that you guys came up with or...?    [00:47:58] >> Not intentionally, but, I mean, it kind of ended up being that way.  I mean, you know, it ended up being that, you know, I mean, you know, I think it was the first day we were in there and I just wrote out the numbers, and I didn't think anyone would really care, but then, you know, they all wanted to be -- everyone wanted to be, you know, the one to check it off when we were done with the day, so.  So it kind of became I suppose a team-building thing.    [00:48:20] >> Yeah.  I guess in an environment like that, like those little things, you really just look forward to.  And hanging out with Wilson too.    [00:48:27] >> Yeah, you know, having Wilson -- I mean, we used him on a lot of the PAO events and, you know, had them, had them around, and so, yeah, it became kind of a -- kind of a neat, little team-building mascot, as well.    [00:48:43] >> Wow.  So the kinds of people you're looking for to sign up are astronaut-like, right?  In what sense?    [00:48:51] >> So, obviously, our astronauts are very healthy.  So, our -- our subjects have to be able to pass a modified class III Air Force physical, which -- which generally means you're in pretty good health.    [00:49:04] >> Congratulations, Paul.  [Laughter]    [00:49:06] >> So you don't have to be an Olympic athlete or anything like that, but you do need to be pretty -- pretty healthy.  We're looking for people between the age range of 30 and 55.  And I know we've gotten a lot of feedback on that, but -- but by the time our astronauts fly, that's really generally the age range that we're going to see.  So we want them to be similar in terms of, you know, I'll call it social maturity, educational maturity, social maturity, so similar in that respect, to our astronaut corp. Our astronauts are pretty highly-educated.  And so education is also one of our criteria and we -- we are looking for people who have an advanced degree, say a master's degree or above, in some type of STEM, you know, science, technology, engineering, or math field.  That's -- that's our -- our -- our favorite criterion to use, one of our key criterions to use.   [00:50:12] We do find, though, that -- that people who have certain types of backgrounds, say, for instance, a military background.  We can easily substitute military background for that advanced education if -- if a person has, you know, some level of skill in, say, maybe an engineering or a technology type of field, and military experience.  Those people are very similar to our astronaut corp, as well.  So -- so those are some of the -- the major criterion that we're looking for.  You know, we are looking for men, as well as women.  We -- in a perfect world, we would have a career that's -- that's 50/50, you know, half men and half women.  You know, so -- so those healthy, educated, you know, individuals.  Some of the other things that -- that we look for are people who are highly-motivated.   [00:51:14] You know, so maybe goal-oriented, highly-motivated, that's, you know, that describes our astronaut corp to a T. And so, so those are some of the factors that we're looking at, as well.  And -- and, you know, so most of those things are objective, you know, you can -- you check them off, you know, yep, you're in the right age range, yep, you've got the right skillset or educational background, yep, you passed the physical.  And then we also do some interviews and some assessments with the potential crew members and say, yep, this person's definitely goal-oriented, which, you know, helps us to say, you know, this person, if they set a goal to, you know, stay with us for 45 days, by golly, they're going to meet that goal.    [00:52:02] >> That's true.  Because you need good people and good data too.  You don't want someone leaving halfway through it, just like, eh, I'm done.    [00:52:09] >> Yep.    [00:52:09] >> That would be a bad day.    [00:52:10] >> That would be a bad day.  Alright, well, I'm sure there are plenty of people out there like that, but it's interesting that you say, you know, in a perfect world, half -- half men, half women, is that -- is that the ultimate goal or do you kind of mix it up every once in awhile?    [00:52:25] >> So that's -- that's our ultimate goal, and that is the goal that -- that we have from a research perspective.  You know, so over the course of the campaign, they would really dearly love to see that 8 of the 16 were female and 8 of the 16 were male.  So we -- we would like to have that, you know, that 50/50 split in each mission, but we also have to maintain schedule.  And so, sometimes just the way it works out between the people who have applied and who have screened and been found acceptable, they may or may not be available for a specific mission.  So we have had missions where all four crew members were male, we've had missions where all four crew members were female!  And we've had missions with a 50/50 split, and we've had missions with, you know, three of one gender and one of the other.  So, to some degree, we kind of take what we can get, or what's available, it generally comes very close to to 50/50 over the course of the campaign.    [00:53:33] >> Alright.  Well, hey, good -- best of luck to you for getting the candidates for -- for the HERA 5 I guess.  What's the next one called?    [00:53:41] >> Campaign five.    [00:53:42] >> Campaign five, yeah.    [00:53:43] >> Campaign five.    [00:53:44] >> Very cool!  Alright, well, I think that's a great place to wrap up, and if you stay tuned until afterwards, we'll tell you exactly where to sign up so you can possibly be a HERA crew member if you meet all the qualifications that Lisa said, but Lisa and Paul, thanks so much for -- for coming in today.  Lisa, I know you're busy, so thanks for running over here [laughter].  I appreciate this.  This was really cool!  I really...    [00:54:05] >> Yeah, thank you.    [00:54:05] >> Just to know about HERA.  I've been to HERA and visited a couple of times, but just to -- to dive in and understand what it's like to be there, that's -- that's pretty cool.  So thanks again for coming on!    [00:54:15] >> Thank you!    [00:54:15] >> Absolutely!  And if you're over 30, consider joining us.    [00:54:20] >> Almost there.  [Laughter]    [00:54:23] [ Music ]  Hey, thanks for sticking around!  So, based on Lisa's description, if you think you're qualified to stay in HERA for those 45 day missions, and from what Paul was describing -- was describing, they sounded pretty cool.  Just go to nasa.gov/analogs/HERA.  That is the official HERA page, and if you scroll to the bottom, there's a box that says, want to participate, and there you can see all the qualifications and how to apply and all that kind of stuff and be prepared for campaign five next year.  Those 45-day missions that Lisa was talking about, and the new mission profile that they're going to be doing.   [00:55:24] We also like to post about HERA on social media, on the NASA Johnson Space Center accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.  If you have a question about HERA, just use the hashtag NASA on any one of those platforms, and ask a question about HERA, we'll answer it, otherwise, if you have an idea for the show that you want us to do, maybe you want us to do another episode on HERA or on something else entirely.  Make sure to mention it's for, Houston, We Have a Podcast, and we'll make sure to answer it for you or even do a whole episode on it.  So this podcast was recorded on November 16th, 2017.  Thanks to Alex Perryman for producing the show, and thanks again to Miss Lisa Spence and Dr. Paul Haugen for coming on the show.  We'll be back next week!",

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 84, Engage Thrusters.  I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today.  On this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, and astronauts.  All to let you know the coolest information about what's going on right here at NASA.  So if you are familiar with us, you may know that we've been reviewing some of the top technologies for spacecraft to survive in deep space.  We've talked with experts that work on NASA's Orion spacecraft, the one that will be traveling into deep space.  And we've talked about life support, protecting from heat and radiation, and maintaining navigation and communication.  And we'll tell you all of those episode numbers at the end, if you want to check them out.  So today, we're talking about Orion's propulsion system and how it will help maintain the vehicle's course through the cosmos.  We're talking with Steve Barsi, European Service Module Propulsion Subsystem Manager based at the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio.  The service module is being built by the European Space Agency.  It serves as the powerhouse for the spacecraft with 33 engines, one that serves as the main engine for major in-space maneuvering, a few auxiliary engines, and then the rest of them for basically steering.   We talk with Steve about the propulsion system, how it works and why it's suited for deep space travel.  So with no further delay, let's jump right ahead to our talk with Mr. Steve Barsi.  Enjoy.    [ Music ]    Host: Steve, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today to talk about propulsion and how we're going to get to deep space and the energy needed.  Thank you very much.    Steve Barsi: Thanks.  It's great to be here.    Host: Okay, so the topic is propulsion.  I guess, when I think about propulsion, I thing about the movies and the, you know, the main pilot of the Starship Enterprise pushing forward and actually, you know, going warp speed into space.  But I'm assuming it's a little more complicated than that.  So I kind of wanted to start by backing up and getting the very basics of propulsion.  So if someone asks you, \"Steve, what is propulsion,\" what do you say?    Steve Barsi: So propulsion is just the mechanism by which a vehicle accelerates or translates through space.  And so it doesn't necessarily have to be a pilot.  It could be an autonomous system with multiple classes of engine.  It's basically anything—it’s the mechanism by which you get from point A to point B.    Host: Okay, pretty important when it comes to actually flying in space, right?  So it's different from an actual launch, right?  I guess that it is technically propulsion.  But what we're talking about is the Orion vehicle actually flying through space.  And actually, it's not like you see in the movies where you just see that glowing blue light at the back of the ship just constantly firing with a constant acceleration, right?  It's a little bit different when you're actually trying to fly through space.  I guess it's more like coasting, right?    Steve Barsi: Well, there's periods of active propulsion and there's coasting.    Host: Okay.    Steve Barsi: So periods of active propulsion is when essentially any time you're firing any of your thrusters or main engines.  So it could be your reaction control systems.  Those are the smaller thrusters.  It could be your main engine.  But when the engines are not firing, then you're coasting through space.    Host: Okay.  So are they scheduled then?  Do you have to really know when you're going to be firing all of these different engines?    Steve Barsi: So for the main propulsion system and the auxiliary engines, those burns are planned ahead of time, and you execute maneuvers based on the burn plan.  For things like the reaction control system where you're using it to maintain attitude, it's not so much a predefined maneuver.  You're firing thrusters to maintain your spacecraft attitude.    Host: Okay.  So basically you're firing the thrusters to make sure you're pointing the right way.  And you're not turning or any kind of -- Okay, so that's what it is.  And this is interesting.  I was reading about the propulsion system.  There's 33 engines, right?  But only one of them is like the engine that you think about when you think about propulsion, right?  The one that just fires and you just go, right?  The other 32 are for what you're -- for maintaining the attitude.    Steve Barsi: Yes.  So there's a main engine on Orion.    Host: Okay.    Steve Barsi: And that's, I think, what you're kind of alluding to.    Host: Yes.    Steve Barsi: Around the main engine to the main engine at the center of the vehicle on the bottom on the service module, around that main engine, there's eight auxiliary engines.  Those essentially provide the same function.  So they'll provide similar translational thrust maneuvers, and they back up the main engine in case there's a failure.    Host: I see.    Steve Barsi: It's the 24 smaller thrusters that are used for attitude control.    Host: Okay.  The main and then you got auxiliary and in the auxiliary control.  Okay.  I thought there was 32.  That clears things up a bit.  All right, so what are you firing, you know?  Is it that nice blue light that you see in the movies?  Or what are you actually using to make the propulsion work?    Steve Barsi: So the two fuels that we use, it's a bipropellant system.  The fuel is monomethylhydrazine .  We abbreviate it with MMH.  And then the oxidizer is called MON3.  It's mixed oxides of nitrogen.    Host: Okay, so the propulsion is a chemical reaction?    Steve Barsi: Yes.  So it's a hyperbolic system.  So when the fuel comes into contact with the oxidizer, it just ignites.  So there's no igniter necessary on any of the engines on the service module.    Host: Okay, so how does everything work?  Do you have the oxidizer over here and then the other thing over here, and then they touch?  And when they connect and make that chemical reaction?  It spits out the --    Steve Barsi: Yes.  You have the fuel and the oxidizer in separate tanks.  It's actually two oxidizer tanks and two fuel tanks on the European Service Module.  And downstream of those tanks you have valves and plumbing that essentially gets the propellant from the tanks to where you need it—to where it’s needed at the engine level.  So you have plumbing and valves to get it to the main engine, to the RCS engines, and the auxiliary engines.  And then, once the two propellants come into contact in the injector, or downstream of the injector, they'll ignite.  You'll get a reaction and thrust is produced.  And that's what provides the motive force to get you to where you want to go.    Host: There you go.  Just these two things meeting and then firing out.  And just that little bit of force is really all it takes to make the thing go and to actually control the attitude and then to have that main engine, and the auxiliary engine is there too.  So when you're thinking about the fuel, you said you have two of the one type and then the two of the oxidizer, right?    Steve Barsi: Two tanks of each.    Host: Two tanks of each.  How much are you bringing with you?  Yeah, I guess you have to think about weight versus, you know, the mission itself and all those kinds of constraints.    Steve Barsi: So each tank holds about 2100 liters of propellant.    Host: Okay.  Compared to, I guess, a car or like a -- I don't know.  I'm trying to draw a comparison of how much that is, 2100 liters.    Steve Barsi: So a car is probably on the order of 14 gallons or so, so significantly more than what your car holds.    Host: Several cars, many cars.  Okay, so the tanks themselves that are actually holding the fuel, I'm imagining like a circular kind of spacey-looking tank.  Is that what it is?  Is it a spherical tank?    Steve Barsi: So we've got several tanks on the vehicle.  The propellant tanks are the tanks that actually hold the propellant.  You might think of it as a cylindrical barrel with hemispherical domes on it.    Host: Okay.    Steve Barsi: So that's kind of what the propellant tanks look like.  The other tanks we have on the vehicle are high-pressure gas tanks.  So basically we use regulated high-pressure gas to push the propellant out of the propellant tanks.  And so those are spherical tanks and they contain our helium, which we use to pressurize the propellant tanks.    Host: So you have tanks that hold the fuel and then tanks to push the fuel?    Steve Barsi: Yes.  So tank that hold gas that --    Host: Hold the gas that pushes the fuel?  Okay.    Steve Barsi: Yes.    Host: Okay, this is a pretty complicated system.  How much of the—this is all—I guess we should go kind of back to where is all of this, right?  It's not on Orion.  This is on the European Service Module.    Steve Barsi: Right.    Host: What else is on the European Service Module?    Steve Barsi: So the European Service Module is essentially the powerhouse of Orion.  So you've got your solar arrays there.  You've got avionics boxes.  The avionics boxes, they do a lot of the commanding of the valves on the propulsion system.  But you've got the terminal system.  And so there's a number of substances that make up the European Service Module.    Host: Okay, the avionics boxes are computers?    Steve Barsi: So you could think of it as a pass-through.  The vehicle computer is on the crew module side of the interface.    Host: I see.    Steve Barsi: But they essentially take commands from the crew module and then turn that into electrical pulses that open and close valves.    Host: There you go.  Okay, all right.  And then the thermal is to make sure that the vehicle itself is at a reasonable temperature?    Steve Barsi: Well, predominantly, the European Service Module in and of itself --    Host: Oh I see.    Steve Barsi: But yes, it's the control temperature of the vehicle.    Host: Okay.  And the European Service Module is where the solar arrays are, right?    Steve Barsi: Yes.    Host: So there you go.  There's your powerhouse.  You have the actual electricity.  You've got the fuel.  You know, that's a pretty important piece.  So how is the European Service Module -- Does it draw from any lessons we learned or any technology that we've used in the past, like any kind of Apollo technology or any kind of Shuttle technology?  You know, what's inside there?    Steve Barsi: Yes.  So I think that probably the two vehicles you could probably point to are shuttle and ATV, the Automated Transfer Vehicle that the Europeans developed.    Host: That was a cargo vehicle, right?    Steve Barsi: Yes.  That's probably where we started.  And so a lot of the, I'd say, original concept of the design, you can trace back to some kind of ATV heritage.  I think there are a lot of some Shuttle influences in the design, and I think the biggest example of that is on the main engine and the thrust vector control system.  So our current OMS engine, the Orbital Maneuvering System engine, and the thrust vector control, those systems have both flown on shuttles already.  And so at the start of Orion, we had this inventory available that met Orion's needs.  And so we essentially repurposed those hardware to fulfill these objectives that we have on Orion.    Host: Okay.  So they're proven.  You know they work.  Okay, so this is the part—this is the main engine with those auxiliary engines that you were talking about?    Steve Barsi: It's the main engine.    Host: Main engine, okay.    Steve Barsi: It's the main engine.  Again, it wasn't just a drop and replacement from shuttle.  We did essentially service the engine prior to delivery to Airbus.  We added some redundant instrumentation.  Shuttle had two OMS engines, so there was some redundancy there.  So we added instrumentation to the engine itself to buy back some redundancy.  Shuttle flew in low Earth orbit; Orion doesn't.    Host: Yes.   Steve Barsi: So there was some thermal constraints on the engine that we just didn't have to deal with on shuttle.  So we modified the engine to essentially add a thermal protection to intercept any heat for those deep space missions.  So that's kind of the pedigree on the OMS engine, the pedigree on the thrust vector control.  So it's two actuators and two controllers.  So the thrust vector control actuators, one end attaches to the OMS engine.   The other end attaches to the structure on the ESM.  And basically on command, you can gimble the engine and pitch in yaw directions to vector your thrust in a certain direction.    Host: Okay.  The idea is control?    Steve Barsi: Yeah.    Host: The idea is to make sure you're pointing the right way.  And the extra technology you need to move from shuttle to Orion is the extra constraints that deep space puts on you, especially thermal.  Which direction?  I guess both directions, right?  Hot and cold?    Steve Barsi: Predominantly cold.    Host: Predominantly cold?    Steve Barsi: Well, actually, I take that back.  It is both on the hot and the cold.  The cold because there are certain attitudes where we're pointing the nozzle to deep space.  And so the nozzle is acting like a radiator just pulling heat out of that engine.  On the hot side, there are attitudes when we're pointing the tail towards the sun, and we have solar energy just impinging the engine and warming things up.  So it's a mixed bag, both hot and cold provided some challenges for modifying the engine for use on Orion.    Host: I could imagine.  It's not as easy as, you know, just fire the engine and go.  Just where is the engine?  Where's the sun and how it's facing the engine?  You have to think about all that whenever you're flying.  That makes flying a little bit more difficult.  [Laughs] Okay, so let's talk about the European Service Module a little bit more.  We kind of went through all of the different, I guess, components of what's inside of it.  So where are we at with it, you know?  Where is it being built?  I think you mentioned Airbus.  Airbus is one of the, I guess, prime contractors of it too?    Steve Barsi: So Airbus is ESA's prime contract.  On the propulsion system, the Airbus folks in Bremen, Germany are the primary group of people responsible for the propulsion system.  But they leverage a number of resources and suppliers, both within Europe and in the US, that make up the entire propulsion system.    Host: Okay yeah.  How we how it working with them then, to make sure everything comes together?    Steve Barsi: It's certainly been a learning experience.  But the vehicle is built.  It was delivered to KSC.  So the first vehicle is back in the US, and we're taking all those lessons learned and applying them to the build of the second ESM.    Host: Okay.  So was it tested in Germany or is it going to be tested here?  A little bit of both?    Steve Barsi: A little bit of both.  So before, you know, any component leaves your supplier, you do testing at the lowest level possible.  So that could be at a valve level.  It could be at a sensor level.  Those parts are delivered to Germany.  They get integrated.  You test them at the next higher assembly.  Ultimately, you install that assembly into the vehicle and you do a number of tests at the European Service Module level prior to shipment.  So those tests were completed and the vehicle just arrived at KSC.  And over the next several months, it's going to be subjected to a number of integrated spacecraft tests.  And it will go through a battery of tests, both functional tests and test during environments, so acoustic testing, thermal vac testing, thermal cycle testing, just to shake out the system prior to flight.    Host: Yeah.  Getting, you know, any kind of things that you've missed.  That's really what you're going to do.  The poor thing, you're going to just blast everything at it?    Steve Barsi: Yep.    Host: All right.  So it's a lot of things for the European Service Module itself, right?  To make sure it's going to withstand the environment of space, you know, launch, everything in between.  So what about the propulsion system, testing there?  How do you make sure that everything's going to fire the way you want it to?    Steve Barsi: So it's the same thing.  So the first thing that gets done, they'll mate the European Service Module to the crew module adapter.  We'll do a number of approved tests and leak tests on those joints that we just welded up.  There's a battery of functional tests that get performed where you're opening and closing valves, making sure that the Service Module is communicating with the vehicle.  And the Service Module is a part of that integrated spacecraft assembly testing.  So it’ll see acoustic testing and thermal testing as well.  And we'll be checking out the system along the way to make sure it's still healthy.    Host: Okay, so it's part of that whole integrated testing, you know.  Why would you test the system separate if you can just do everything altogether.  You're getting similar results, even better actually, because that's how it's going to be positioned and everything.  Steve Barsi: Yep.  Host: So that makes sense.  Okay, so let's talk about the missions coming up.  You know, we're testing a lot of this right now.  We have the European Service Module, I guess, in Florida right now.  Crew module is being tested.  We had a couple podcasts about the escape system.  We've got a lot of tests going on here.  Everything's going to come together and you're going to launch everything and test it and EM1, Expiration Mission 1.  So what are we looking forward to for propulsion testing on EM1?  What's that going to look like?    Steve Barsi: So we saw qualification testing in front of us.  So that's our integrated subsystem testing down at White Sands, where we're firing multiple thrusters, the main engine, the auxiliary engine, and the RCS in an integrated fashion, doing different burn profiles.  Just shaking out the system at the propulsion subsystem level.  And from a propulsion standpoint, that's probably the most important testing we can do to qualify the subsystem, because we get all the interactions with the different engines firing.  And for our purposes, it's pretty important from an overall spacecraft certification.  But once we pass the propulsion qualification subsystem testing, there's really no additional testing outside of the normal integrated spacecraft test that the rest of the vehicle is going to go through, at least from a subsystem level, that we'd say we're ready to fly.    Host: Okay.  Well, that's coming up soon then. It seems like, you know, a lot of these boxes have been checked.  You know, one thing that just came up, just based on what we were talking about.  You know, testing and then we're actually going to fly this in deep space, right?  This is for EM1.  I was thinking about the fuel.  You said the fuel was MMH, right?  And they have an oxidizer?  Why those?  Why did you choose those kinds of fuel for deep space versus, I guess, other types?    Steve Barsi: Well, the other class of fuel was cryogenic, and any cryogenic fuels have the challenge of being able to keep them cold for long duration deep space missions.    Host: Okay.  So this works for this mission profile.  Deep space, you know that it's going to work.  It's going work where you want it, how you want it, that kind of thing.    Steve Barsi: Plus the pedigree of the -- I mean, that was the fuel system that's been used on multiple vehicles.    Host: Proven.    Steve Barsi: Yeah.    Host: Yeah, that kind of helps too.  So I guess, EM2.  Now we're looking forward to actually putting crew on the vehicle and testing it with crew.  Any differences there or is it pretty much the same?    Steve Barsi: So there are differences.  I mean, at the subcomponent level.  We're re-building valves that, you know, we might not have been for EM1.  We're using different sensors in some cases.  I think the biggest addition for EM2, at least from a propulsion standpoint, is the addition of helium cross feed.  So that allows you to essentially pressurize one propellant tank in the event you have some anomaly or blockage in another part of the system.  So from a crew survivability standpoint, it was important to add that capability.    Host: Crew survivability. Redundancy?  Is that what it really what it comes down to?    Steve Barsi: Yeah.  So if there is some blockage or leakage in the system and you find yourself in an inability to pressurize one of the propellant tanks, cross feed will give you a capability to get the crew back.    Host: Okay.  There you go.  Which is, you know, that's one of the main things about flying people is crew safety.  Making sure you can get them back.  So what about the actual control of the propulsion, for EM2 or for, I guess, any mission really?  Are the crew actually -- Do they have a stick and are they controlling where the thing is going to go and where the thrusters are firing?  Or is a lot of this automated?  How is everything controlled?    Steve Barsi: It's mostly automated.  I think for future flights there will be some manual control of the reaction control jets.  But for the most part, the burn plan will be something that'll be defined prior to launch.    Host: Okay.  Do you have a good idea of the plan for propulsion during some of those missions actually going around the moon and everything?  So like once the spacecraft actually separates from the rocket, right, SLS, at what point are those main engines firing?  At what point are the, you know, the thrusters firing to control the attitude?  Do you have a good understanding, even right now, of when things are going to happen?    Steve Barsi: I think a decent understanding.    Host: Okay.    Steve Barsi: I think from our perspective though, from a propulsion standpoint, we're giving the vehicle a capability.  And so basically what we're saying you can fire your main engine up to X number of seconds.  You can fire your auxiliary engines for this duration.  You know, how you choose to use up that total amount of burned duration is something that the mission planners have something at their disposal when they design a specific trajectory.    Host: There you go.  That's the difference between the engineering side and the operation side.  You just define this is how long you can fire a thruster.  And it's up to the operation folks to say, all right, we want to fire here because we want to go here and make sure that it's having a backup for this.  Okay, that's cool.  So are you working pretty closely with the operations folks then, to understand what they're mission needs are to actually define the requirements for building the spacecraft?    Steve Barsi: Yes.  And it's always a give-and-take.  I mean, on one hand, from a mission planning perspective, you want to maximize your amount of capability.  And sometimes that doesn't always mesh with what the hardware can actually do.  And so there's a give-and-take between trying to maximize the vehicle capability and stay within the component or engine capability that they can deliver to the system.    Host: Okay.  Is there any kind of cross-disciplinary sharing, especially within Orion too.  So are you the propulsion guys talking with the avionics guys talking with the life-support guys?  Is there some cross-disciplinary stuff there to make sure everything just works together?    Steve Barsi: It is.  So we are very close couple with the avionics guys.  Without commands to fire the engines, our propulsion system isn't going to do anything.    Host: There you go.    Steve Barsi: We are working closely with them.  And from a thermal standpoint too, we do work closely with the thermal team and trying to understand and make sure our propellant doesn't freeze in our lines, for instance.  And cause a blockage.  So we do work closely with the thermal team as well.    Host: That's important.  So, at what point, you know, with this testing you have to understand the risks that are associated with actually flying this thing in space.  So the balance of, or I guess the challenge really, of mitigating the risks with understanding how the thing is going to work and making it work efficiently.  So efficiency versus risk.  How do you measure that?    Steve Barsi: It's a judgment call.    Host: Of many people on the team, right?    Steve Barsi: Yep, yep.  But ultimately, I think we're charged with delivering a system that we believe is safe to fly.  And so in some cases, that might not mean that we're able to chase something down to the nth degree.  But again, we believe that we're minimizing risk to the spacecraft from a technical standpoint.    Host: Yeah.  Minimizing risk.  Because ultimately, you've got to hand this technology over and say, \"Okay, put humans on it.  Go fly it,\" you know.  That's pretty important.  You talked about building a capability, especially from an engineering standpoint.  You design the propulsion system to work, and here you go.  You guys do with it what you want, right?  So looking forward to, you know, missions even beyond EM1, EM2, we're talking a lot about the moon now.  We're going back to the moon.  We're going to have missions to the moon.  But then, even beyond the moon, right?  So thinking about the capability there, is a lot of this translatable to many different profiles, just even beyond the moon?    Steve Barsi: Yes.  So again, from a kind of fixed data point, your tanks can only carry so much repellent and your gas tank can only carry so much helium.  But what you do with that, you do have a lot of flexibility in terms of what set points you're operating the engines with, for instance, where you can buy back some capability based on specific engine performance.    Host: Okay, there you go.  So the answer is \"sort of.\"  There's a lot of other factors, right?  You know, you're not just going to blast Orion off into Mars.  There's a lot of other considerations, you know.  Because the vehicle itself is designed for, I think, up to three weeks, right?  For a crew to actually survive on.  So if you're going to go to Mars, you're probably going to need a Mars transit vehicle.  There's a lot of other considerations there.  Propulsion is pretty interesting.  Are there other things you're looking forward to for, I guess, upcoming tests or even something in the near future for propulsion on Orion and the European service module?    Steve Barsi: I’d say the biggest thing I'm looking forward to, from a test perspective, is one of the last -- It's a qualification test we run at the subsystem level at White Sands, is a full-up test with all the engines firing.  And it's stressing from a propellant demand perspective because you're firing all the engines.    Host: At the same time?    Steve Barsi: At the same time, yeah.    Host: That's got to be a sight.    Steve Barsi: Yes.  So that's probably one test that I'm really looking forward to.    Host: Yeah.  It’s kind of like, I was talking with, I think it was Ronnie Bacchus [phonetic] on a couple episodes ago about Orion's heat shield and thermal testing.  And I was like, that's got to be an engineer's dream, man.  You got to do the thermal testing.  All you're doing is shooting fire at the thing, right?  That's pretty fun.    Steve Barsi: Yep.    Host: It's when things, you know—you get to do those sorts of tests, those are really exciting.  And to really not only just, you know, the exciting part of just the visual.  Like wow, this is so cool.  I get to shoot fire at the spacecraft.  I get to you know, really push this thing to the limits, but really to push your knowledge too.  Yeah, everything that you put into this vehicle is being tested.  You're really giving it a run for its money.  If it comes out the other end, you know you did your best.  Thant's not bad.  Well, Steve, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today and describing propulsion.  This is absolutely fascinating, and it sounds like you thought a lot of this through and are working with a great team to make sure everything comes together.  So it's very exciting.    Steve Barsi: Thanks.  It's been a pleasure.    [ Music ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 190, \"Before His Second Flight.\" I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. If you are new to the show, we bring in NASA experts to talk about all different parts of our space agency and sometimes we get lucky enough to bring in astronauts to tell their story. So today, we're talking with Mark Vande Hei. He's a U.S. Astronaut who is about to launch to the International Space Station for his second-long duration spaceflight. He happened to be one of the very first gets we had on the podcast back in Episode 13, “Before His First Flight,” which happened to be the title of that episode. So, in this discussion we talked about his background and anticipation of heading to space, basically continuing the conversation from 2017. We discussed how his first flight ended up going and what he did aboard. We discussed his return and what he's been up to here in NASA since landing in the Kazak steppe. And of course, what he's looking forward to this time around, and how the landscape of the International Space Station has changed in the few short years he spent back on the planet. So, here's a little bit more about astronaut Mark Vande Hei. Enjoy!  [ Music]  Host: Mark Vande Hei, thanks for coming back on Houston We have a Podcast.  Mark Vande Hei: Oh, it's good to be here. Thanks for inviting me.  Host: Hey, I'm just going to pick up from where we last left off. You were one of our first astronaut guests, actually, on this podcast. You were Episode 13. We called that \"Before His First Flight.\" And really, we had that conversation up through the moment right before you were heading over to -- I think it was either Moscow or Baikonur at the time, but really just before your first launch. I want to pick up the conversation from right there. So, from when you last left the studio and you were getting ready for your first launch, what were some of the things that you were doing, some of the thoughts going through your head?  Mark Vande Hei: Oh gosh, that's a long -- a lot's happened since then, of course. So, before launch, there's a lot of ceremonial stuff along with the final exams, of course. I guess I'll just go to the really interesting part and try to keep this answer short. The launch. So, the launch, for me, happened 0 Dark Thirty, I can't remember the exact time. I just do remember it was a not a normal time for me to be awake. Very emotional when you're driving away to say goodbye to everybody. And there's a huge crowd of people cheering you on and you feel like a rock star and then it was shocking though how excited you could feel and then it gets really quiet on the bus and it's dark out and you're driving out into the desert in Kazakhstan to a rocket that's all by itself. And then we got out to the rocket and we got on and I remember thinking to myself, \"Oh my gosh, this thing is leaving in --\" it was less than two hours and I thought to myself, \"I have a lot to do.\" So, we got into the spacecraft and they close us in, get us securely buckled down and then everybody else leaves and you're just sitting out there. So, I guess what I'm trying to convey is a sense of tremendous community and celebratory, and then shockingly quiet and isolated.  Host: Wow.  Mark Vande Hei: And so that was an emotional flip that I didn't expect. Once you get into the process of going through all the checklist to prepare for the launch, that starts seeming, you've practiced this multiple times, you're very focused and even the launch, the launch was so smooth that the biggest shock to me was that nothing went wrong, because all of our training has things going wrong every moment. And so, I was constantly scanning, trying to find the problem that was in the system somewhere because that's what I was trained to do. And there was always something hidden if I just looked carefully enough. But nope, everything worked perfectly. So, I kind of wanted a better story. It wasn't shaky enough. It wasn't violent enough. It was really smooth. And then when you get to orbit and the thrusters are turned off, you really are in a free fall. That's what being in orbit is. You're just falling towards the Earth, but constantly missing it. And it shocked me how it felt just like being at the top of a roller coaster, when you're coming up over the top of a roller coaster and you rise up in the straps. Of course, I was strapped down very tightly. So, when you in a roller coaster, hopefully you're strapped down very tightly too. And if the roller coaster comes over the top and goes from going up to down rapidly, you'll rise up in the seat. Well, that's what I experienced. The reason you feel that in a roller coaster is because you're in a momentary free fall, very short time. For me, it was exactly like that, but it continued for hours. So, that was just a strange sensation that it kept going. And also, kind of had this feeling like I was rotating forward, but very slowly I was rotating forward too. The sunlight was interesting. It's gorgeous, very bright. But there's something a little unsettling about it. And actually, went to a preview in Washington D.C. for \"First Man.\" And I watched the movie and I was really impressed with how they conveyed that feeling in that movie of being in a capsule. And I said, \"something about the lighting that you guys did was great.\" And the director told me, \"Oh yeah, we had a NASA consultant. They said, \"Make sure you use spotlighting.\" I said, \"Spotlighting? What are you talking about?\" He said, \"Yeah, spotlighting. Because the sun is a spotlight when you're out in space.\" And it occurred to me that every time I've experienced any sunlight before I was in orbit, it was always scattered by the atmosphere of the Earth. So, you never really get sunlight that's just direct from one spot. It's always coming from multiple directions because it hits other parts of the atmosphere and gets bent in your direction too. So that's why it was beautiful but weird, if that makes sense. And I couldn't put my finger on what is unsettling about this. So, it was very stark brightness and stark darkness in the shadows as we quickly would move as the spacecraft would go to different angles with the sun. And they had this little window next to me. Getting to the space station, I'll never forget looking out over my left shoulder and seeing the solar rays, much bigger than I ever expected them to be. I lost my composure a little bit, because I was so excited and said, \"Wow,\" during a moment in the spaceflight when we were all supposed to be very quiet and concentrating intensely on the data that we were seeing, the telemetry. Life on the space station was really busy. Got to do lots of spacewalks. Vehicle -- did one vehicle capture. Coming back to Earth, I guess, I really what I want to do is tell you a few things instead of going on for 25 minutes. And then if there's something that's interesting to you, then you can ask me more. So, I'm going to very quickly go through this.  Host: OK.  Mark Vande Hei: The landing process, I didn't realize how afraid I was while I was waiting for the parachute to open and had nothing to do but wait for the parachute to open, until the parachute actually opened and I felt so giddy, because I was super, super happy. That was the first time I had let myself realize that this was actually going to succeed. I was also very shocked with the impact with the ground. In fact, my immediate emotion was I felt angry. I felt like someone had just hit me in the back of the head with a two-by-four, because it was a hard hit. We were fine. Everybody was safe. It was very safe. But it was shocking.  Host: Yeah, they say it's like something like a 30 mile an hour car crash is like the -- is like kind of the feeling.  Mark Vande Hei: I've never been in a 30 mile an hour car crash, but it certainly caught my attention.  Host: Yeah.  Mark Vande Hei: In fact, I made a mistake. One of the things the Russians tell you to prepare for that landing is make sure your head is back in the seat and your mouth is closed. You don't want to bite your tongue if you hit hard. And I thought to myself, \"Well my muscles will probably be weak enough, I won't have had to balance my head. So, keeping my head in the seat shouldn't be a problem. So, just remember to keep your mouth closed.\" I did remember that I should have my head in the seat. But the -- I thought we had about ten seconds before we hit, and I looked up to check something out and then we hit.  Host: Oh.  Mark Vande Hei: So, I hit my head really hard.  Host: Snapped it back. Yeah.  Mark Vande Hei: Yeah. So, I actually was wondering if I made a big enough mistake that I was going to have a concussion, but I was fine.  Host: OK.  Mark Vande Hei: It was no big deal.  Host: While you were in space though, you had -- I mean it was 100 -- let me see, I have the number here somewhere.  Mark Vande Hei: Talking about number of science experiments?  Host: I was going to say number of days, 168.  Mark Vande Hei: Oh yes, yes.  Host: But I'm sure you did a couple hundred science experiments as well.  Mark Vande Hei: I don't know how many I personally did, I know as a team some of which happened to be without our interaction even, there was 234 science experiments that happened while we were onboard.  Host: Yeah, I like the way you described it too, because I think you've done multiple interviews since you've been back, and you know, one of the top things is you know, what are some of the science investigations that you did. And you always describe yourself as, you know, I was more of like a -- there's the lab hands, you know, I was just like the hands just kind of doing the work. That's how you felt, right?  Mark Vande Hei: Yeah, I call it being a laboratory technician.  Host: Technician, yeah.  Mark Vande Hei: My job was to make sure that all the science experiments had the resources they needed. Very rarely was I an observer.  Host: Yeah.  Mark Vande Hei: A lot of times I was just making sure the videos were set up so that they could do the observation. Certainly, wasn't doing any data analysis or writing papers like a scientist would do.  Host: Yeah, and there was -- but there was a lot of work, right. Because you were just -- you were the one lab technician for all these different scientists that had all these different priorities that they wanted to do.  Mark Vande Hei: Because there's so many experiments going on simultaneously, yeah there's no lack of work. In fact, there's more work than we can get done.  Host: Yeah. Always a task list, right. That's just hard to get to. You did a couple spacewalks as well, and I know those were a highlight for you during your first Expedition.  Mark Vande Hei: Yeah, they were, yeah. Good experiences. Everyone I was happy to start and everyone I was happy to finish.  Host: What were some of those lessons that you were learning? Because you're about to go back to the International Space Station, I don't know if spacewalks are on the table, but they certainly could be. So, some of those things you know you're going to take forward with you on those spacewalks given your recent experience.  Mark Vande Hei: So, if I do another spacewalk, things that I will continue to do differently than my first spacewalk is move gently. So, as you can imagine, training under water you overcome water drag. So, every time you want to start moving you impart a force and the water is going to stop you. So, you have to keep adding force to continue moving. If you keep adding force to continue moving in space, you're just going to keep accelerating. That's undesirable. So, my first spacewalk I put in a lot of force to start moving. I had to take out all that force in the opposite direction to stop moving. So, I worked really, really hard. So, when I get back there, I'm sure I'll very gently start motion, make sure I maintain contact, but you can just keep fingertip contact as you wait to get to the right spot, assuming your aim was good enough.  Host: Yeah.  Mark Vande Hei: Another thing that became very helpful on spacewalks after my first was instead of being really, really afraid of letting go with both hands from the space station -- now, just in case someone is concerned, when we let go with both hands from the space station, it's only after we put down a tether that keeps the space station within arms' reach. So, I'm not talking about just letting go and hoping that I just stay in the vicinity. There's lots of safety features to make sure we stay safe. But, there's a big difference between being in the middle of rotating yourself and then letting go while you're rotating, because you'll start to just do a spiral.  Host: Yeah.  Mark Vande Hei: That's very uncomfortable. Versus stopping yourself for three seconds, making sure there's no relative motion between you and the space station and then slowly letting go with your fingers. Because once you're done letting go, you'll stay exactly there. There's a little bit of force from the safety tether, but that didn't seem like a big impact to me. And that makes it much more casual.  Host: It sounds like there's a lot -- so you trained a lot in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory. There's a lot that you can learn under water. But it seems like all these lessons are just that little gap between doing it under water and doing it for real.  Mark Vande Hei: Absolutely.  Host: The motions that you make. I mean that's really the difference there.  Mark Vande Hei: Yes. Every -- the NBL does an incredibly good job of training us. There's just a few little nuances that they can't quite replicate and yeah, you can learn a lot.  Host: Well, let's go back to -- you had that hard landing over in Kazakhstan. What have you been up to since, since you returned to Houston?  Mark Vande Hei: So, everybody who comes back from a spaceflight does a process of debriefings, rehabilitation, and also public events. We travel around for a bit. Share your experience. For me, that ended with me going to Washington D.C. to work as a technical assistant for Bill Gerstenmaier. So, I did that for a while. That was super interesting. I got to see how things work in Washington D.C. at NASA and I very much appreciate the hard work that those folks do. And then I came back to Houston again and worked as the EVA and Robotics assistant to the chief astronaut until I got this assignment.  Host: Wow. OK, so you -- I mean, it sounds like a lot of that time has been -- so some of those lessons that you learned from your spacewalk. What do you do as the -- I guess, leading EVAs and Robotics? What are some of your tasks?  Mark Vande Hei: So, one task is giving recommendations to the chief astronaut for who will do spacewalks.  Host: Oh OK.  Mark Vande Hei: And of course, that comes along with staffing it with the trainers and staffing it with the flight directors to see if anybody has got concerns, but then giving the chief astronaut a recommendation that it will actually work. Same thing with robotic operations on the space station. A big part of the job was also providing some continuity in what the ground team should expect from astronauts. For example, we had a lot -- we had 13 spacewalks in a year, recently. And there's a lot of desire to do spacewalks really, really quickly. And my job in some cases was to share what situation that would create for the people actually executing the spacewalk. And to talk to them, if we ended up doing things pretty rapidly or maybe we decided we're going to go ahead and have to do it this quickly, make sure everyone understood that this is something we haven't done before with space station crew members, who are different from space shuttle crew members. Because space shuttle crew members used to get trained multiple times on a very specific EVA, whereas space station crew members don't get trained as much on a specific task, but they'll get trained for years on generic tasks and have to adapt to whatever we tell them that they need to do. Of course, they're also spending more time in space so that has effects as well. And then training wise, so we had an astronaut candidate class that was finishing up as I was still working in that job. And what does it mean to say that somebody is certified to do EVAs? Or certified to operate the robotic arm? Things like that. Making sure we had a consistent grading and were fair, both maintaining a really high standard, but also making sure it's the same standard for everybody.  Host: That's very true. Yeah. And I didn't really think about the tasks of a spacewalk. I guess you're right. I mean when you're doing a shuttle, you train exactly for what you're going to do. There is a lot of challenges, not only -- and you described it so well -- not only with training, providing a generic training so that you can adapt to whatever task needs to be accomplished, but if you're talking about so many EVAs, so many spacewalks in a short period of time, when you yourself are in space for a long period of time, it could feel a little bit draining. I don't know if you've experienced that yourself in space, just having to do so many tasks. We talked about spacewalks. We talked about different science experiments. If you felt a sense of, \"man, there's a lot to do in just these short six months.\"  Mark Vande Hei: I definitely felt like there's a lot to do. I felt very fortunate because I think between my first and second spacewalk there was -- it was a five-day center to center. So, hatch opening on the first spacewalk to hatch opening on the second spacewalk was five days. I thought that was perfect, because that also happened over the course -- during that time I had a weekend off, which gave me a whole weekend to study for the next spacewalk and to think about it. So that was ideal for me. And I think had I had spacewalks four months apart, it would have been harder to carry the lessons learned from the first spacewalk into the second spacewalk. So, they were so quick for me that that was really helpful, but far enough apart I didn't have any lingering effects. I didn't have -- sometimes people lose fingernails after a spacewalk. You can have a lot of hand soreness. I had enough -- I didn't have anything serious enough that I wasn't completely recovered before the second spacewalk. So, we got to pay attention to that having physical recovery and enough mental time to get mentally prepared for the next thing too. But for me it was, I was very fortunate. Months later I did another spacewalk. I can't remember how quickly they were in succession, the third and fourth one, but I was definitely a fan of being able to -- once I start spacewalks, focus on that and do nothing else, ideally, as opposed to flipping between science and spacewalk stuff.  Host: Yup. A lot has happened since you've returned, when you talked about, you know, your main task. You did a little bit of time at headquarters and then you came back, and you were working EVAs and robotics. But a lot has happened, especially in the astronaut world. We have commercial crew astronauts. We've assigned astronauts to walk on the Moon. There's just a lot happening in your office. Talk about that landscape from when you landed to right now. Just like, how the astronaut office itself has really changed.  Mark Vande Hei: It's interesting you mentioned those things as changes to the astronaut office, because I think the thing that feels like the biggest effect is COVID right now. Because we're not seeing each other. I'm fortunate because I've been going to training and I get to see people that are making sure they're well protected and that I'm well protected, but I get to interact with people. But if you're not assigned to a flight, you're doing your job from home, just like everybody else. And it's challenging just like for everybody else. It's a very dynamic time in the astronaut office, which if I was a new astronaut I would think, it's the perfect time to be here because opportunities are just going to blossom.  Host: Yeah.  Mark Vande Hei: There's going to be challenges, but that's also always opportunities for growth and gives you great ways to contribute. So, I think there's a lot to look forward to right now.  Host: I know you're not really together then because of COVID, right. You're not seeing each other as often, but I wonder if you've experienced -- you talked about the new astronauts, I'm thinking of the astronauts that came in 2017, or as candidates and now they're astronauts and some of them have already been assigned to a few flights. I wonder if you're seeing that from that class of astronauts, a sense of excitement on what we have ahead of us?  Mark Vande Hei: Oh my gosh, yes. Many of them are assigned to that Artemis team --  Host: Yeah.  Mark Vande Hei: -- to be ready to walk on the Moon someday. That's certainly exciting. Some are assigned to be ready for a Soyuz potentially or back or some are primary crew members for Dragon spacecraft if I understand correctly. Yeah, there's a lot going on.  Host: Very much so. Now, going back to you, you have this flight coming up. You're going to be flying Soyuz again. What are some of the next things that you're looking forward to? Is it much of the same? Has it changed a little bit?  Mark Vande Hei: It's going to be very different for me.  Host: OK.  Mark Vande Hei: Knock on wood, being on that Soyuz crew because this time I'll be in the right seat as opposed to the left seat. The left seat was being a copilot. So, I was fully engaged last time in flying the spacecraft. And sometimes -- most of the time I was pressing the buttons on behalf of the commander, something I definitely didn't want to mess up. This time, my responsibilities in the Soyuz are going to be very minimal. I think every two hours, if I remember correctly, I have to pump the condensate out, 120 pumps in two minutes.  Host: All right.  Mark Vande Hei: That's my job and I jokingly will be like, \"Is it time? Is it time? Can I pump the condensate yet?\" So, I'll be a lot more relaxed.  Host: Cool. Cool.  Mark Vande Hei: And when I get to the space station, I'm hoping that will continue. My goal is to do what people tell me. And I expect a lot of changes and I expect, again, things change but I hope my contribution is going to be just rolling with those changes and keeping a real steady sense of joy about this opportunity and doing my job. I'm probably spending -- I have fewer personal goals this time when I go to the space station. Like last time I had all kinds of things I needed to take pictures of. This time -- and that actually became a stressor because I had limited time and every week, I had a to-do list I was trying to get through. This time I just want to be a little more peaceful about the whole thing and try to enjoy it. Maybe -- I didn't journal last time. I would love to start journaling more and try to capture -- for me, my assumption is that this is going to be my last opportunity to do something like this, so I want to do as good a job as I can to record it for myself if no one else.  Host: That's incredible personal goals. It seems like you've put a lot of thought into the things that you want to do. Are you sharing this with -- I'm sure there's like, I'm going back to the newer class of astronauts, right, you're thinking about this as your last flight and I'm sure like a lot of the newer astronauts are looking forward to doing exactly what you did on your first flight, like, \"I have so much I want to do. I have this huge task list.\" I wonder if there's a benefit to that. Say, absolutely you should do that on your first flight. Or maybe, maybe this next flight that you're talking about, take it easy, journal, you know, decrease stress maybe overall in your workload. Maybe that's a benefit that you can pass on to some of the newer astronauts. Actually, it might be good to take your time.  Mark Vande Hei: It depends on the person.  Host: OK.  Mark Vande Hei: There's Norishige Kanai was on the space station with me.  Host: Yeah.  Mark Vande Hei: He would work on the weekends and work on the task list on the weekends and I just didn't do that. That was my free time and I had my own personal task list. And then I pulled him aside one day and said, \"Hey --\", his call sign is \"Nemo.\" That's how my classmates all call him \"Nemo.\" I said, \"Nemo, you know you don't have to do this on the weekend, right.\" And he said, \"Yeah, but it's actually more pleasant for me to work when I can do it at my own pace.\" So, he gained a sense of peace from getting things done, but without any stress of needing to get it done. So that's why I say everybody is different. Nemo was different from me as far as what our needs were. And I would say even my needs on that first flight might be different from my needs on the second flight. So, we're constantly changing human beings.  Host: Wow. Yeah, you just find that thing that gives you that sense of peace, because I guess that's an important thing to carry with you. You know you're going to be on station for a long time, so you have to find that thing, whatever it may be, because it sounds like it's unique per crew member, but the thing that's going to keep you -- you know, keep you going for that long period of time.  Mark Vande Hei: Yup.  Host: Very cool. Well, Mark Vande Hei, I think that's all the questions I have. I want to wish you the best of luck on your journey and Godspeed. Thanks for talking to me today.  Mark Vande Hei: Thanks very much for having me come today. I appreciate it. Good talking to you again.  Host: Thanks.

        description: ">> HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST. WELCOME TO THE OFFICIAL PODCAST OF THE NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, EPISODE 17: ORION. I’M GARY JORDAN AND I’LL BE YOUR HOST TODAY. SO THIS IS THE PODCAST WHERE WE BRING IN THE EXPERTS-- NASA SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, ASTRONAUTS-- ALL TO LET YOU KNOW ALL THE COOLEST INFORMATION ABOUT NASA. SO TODAY WE’RE TALKING ABOUT THE ORION SPACECRAFT WITH NUJOUD MERANCY. SHE’S THE MISSION PLANNING AND ANALYSIS LEAD HERE AT THE NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER IN HOUSTON, TEXAS FOR THE ORION SPACECRAFT. AND WE HAD A GREAT DISCUSSION ABOUT ORION-- WHAT IT IS, HOW IT WILL WORK, AND WHERE IN SPACE IT WILL BRING HUMANS TO EXPLORE. SO WITH NO FURTHER DELAY, LET’S GO LIGHT SPEED AND JUMP RIGHT AHEAD TO OUR TALK WITH MRS. NUJOUD MERANCY. ENJOY. [ MUSIC ] >> T MINUS FIVE SECONDS AND COUNTING-- MARK. [ INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ] >> HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST! [ MUSIC ] >> OKAY, WELL, NUJOUD, THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO COME ON THE PODCAST. I’M HONESTLY KIND OF SURPRISED THAT WE HAVEN’T DONE AN ORION EPISODE SO FAR. I MEAN, WE’VE HINTED AT IT, BUT WE REALLY HAVEN’T GOTTEN DOWN AND LIKE SAID WHAT IS ORION. SO THANKS FOR COMING ON TODAY. >> AH, YOU’RE WELCOME. I’M GLAD TO BE HERE. >> ABSOLUTELY. SO, HONESTLY, THAT’S KIND OF WHAT I WANTED TO DO TODAY, IS JUST KIND OF HONE IN-- WHAT IS ORION? THE GENERAL OVERVIEW. SO LET’S JUST START WITH THAT. IF YOU COULD DESCRIBE IT IN A NICE, OVERARCHING BIRDSEYE VIEW, WHAT IS ORION? >> ORION IS SUPPOSED TO BE AMERICA’S NEXT CREW VEHICLE FOR BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT. SO REALLY, THE POINT IS TO RETURN TO EXPLORATION, WHICH WE REALLY HAVEN’T DONE SINCE APOLLO DAYS, RIGHT? WE HAD THE SPACE SHUTTLE AND THE SPACE STATION, AND THEY’RE DOING AMAZING SCIENCE AND RESEARCH, BUT THEY STAYED IN LOW EARTH ORBIT. SO TO ACTUALLY GET OUT OF LOW EARTH ORBIT IS A CHALLENGE WE HAVEN’T HAD IN 40 YEARS, AND THAT’S WHERE ORION AND THE SPACE LAUNCH SYSTEM ROCKET COMES IN. >> ALL RIGHT, OKAY. SO YEAH, WE COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BOTH, BUT ORION IS THE SPACECRAFT. THAT’S THE ONE THAT’S ACTUALLY GOING TO CARRY THE PEOPLE. >> RIGHT, ORION HAS THE PEOPLE, YES. WE’RE-- AND OF COURSE, I’M ORION. SO WE’RE THE MOST IMPORTANT, OF COURSE. [ LAUGHTER ] >> ALL RIGHT, SO LET’S JUST FOCUS ON THE MOST IMPORTANT PART, THEN, RIGHT? LET’S FOCUS ON ORION. SO I MEAN, WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE? IF YOU HAD NO IDEA WHAT ORION LOOKED LIKE, HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT? >> SO ORION’S GOT SEVERAL PIECES. SO EACH ONE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT, RIGHT? WHEN YOU STACK IT ALL TOGETHER, WE HAVE A LAUNCH ABORT TOWER ON TOP. SO THAT’S ONLY THERE FOR THE FIRST PART OF ASCENT. >> OKAY. >> AND SO-- BUT WE GET RID OF THAT ONCE WE’RE HIGH ENOUGH UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE THAT WE DON’T NEED IT. BUT SO WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO IT, WHAT THE PIECES THAT WILL ACTUALLY FLY IN SPACE LOOK LIKE IS A CAPSULE SHAPE VERY SIMILAR TO APOLLO. WE’RE ACTUALLY USING THE SAME ANGLE ON THE BACK SHELL THAT APOLLO DID. >> OH, WOW. >> AND THAT’S BECAUSE PHYSICS DON’T CHANGE, SO THE REENTRY AERODYNAMICS ARE THE SAME REGARDLESS OF WHAT DECADE IT IS. >> YEAH. >> AND THEN THERE’S THE SERVICE MODULE, WHICH IS REALLY A BARREL STRUCTURE ON THE BACK END WITH FOUR SOLAR ARRAYS HANGING OFF THE SIDES. SO THAT’S THE REAL HEART OF ORION THAT DOES THE MISSION IN DEEP SPACE. >> OKAY, YEAH. I’M IMAGINING A CAPSULE WITH A BARREL ATTACHED. >> YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] >> BUT DEFINITELY, I MEAN, HONESTLY, IF YOU’RE LISTENING AND YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, DEFINITELY LOOK IT UP. IT’S PRETTY COOL. AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT MODELS OF ORION, RIGHT? BECAUSE THERE’S THE ONE THAT’S GOING TO FLY, BUT THEN YOU’RE USING A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT ONES FOR TESTING, RIGHT? >> YEAH, OF COURSE. SO EVERYTHING WE DO, WE HAVE TO TEST BEFORE WE FLY IT. >> SURE, YEAH. >> SO WE GO THROUGH A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PIECES, RIGHT? SO WE BUILT THE STRUCTURAL TEST ARTICLE, WHICH THEY DO VIBRATION TESTING AND ACOUSTIC TESTING ON, AND THEY PUT LOADS ON IT TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO STRESSES THAT WE WEREN’T CALCULATING. BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PROVE THAT THE STRUCTURE WE BUILT IS STRONG ENOUGH TO SURVIVE. >> RIGHT. >> YOU HAVE TO VALIDATE ALL OF THE ANALYSIS AND DESIGNS YOU DID. AND THEN THERE’S ONES WE USE FOR DROP TESTS. THERE’S FLIGHT TEST VERSIONS. THERE’S ONES WE DROP IN THE OCEAN THAT THE CREW GETS OUT OF. THERE’S A MOCKUP IN BUILDING 9 HERE AT JSC WHICH IS THE  INTERIOR IS ALL ACCURATE SO THAT THE ASTRONAUTS CAN BE TRAINED IN THERE, AND THE DESIGNERS CAN SEE WHERE THINGS LAY OUT, BECAUSE IT’S A LOT DIFFERENT BEING THERE AND PUTTING YOUR HANDS ON IT THAN IT IS TO JUST HAVE A CAD MODEL ON A COMPUTER SCREEN. >> DEFINITELY. >> SO YOU CAN’T-- YOU’VE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOUR VENT DOESN’T GO WHERE YOUR HAND CONTROLLER IS, AND STUFF LIKE THAT. >> YEAH. >> SO-- AND WE HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF ORION, REALLY. >> AND I FEEL LIKE THAT ONE, THE MOCKUP VERSION, WOULD BE GOOD JUST FOR ERGONOMICS, RIGHT? JUST TO SEE WHERE THINGS ARE POINTING. AND YOU’RE RIGHT, YOU COULD DO A COMPUTER SIMULATION, BUT ONCE YOU SIT DOWN A HUMAN IN THERE, YOU REALLY CAN FIND A LOT OF STUFF OUT, RIGHT? >> AND WE REALLY DO. THE ASTRONAUTS COME IN AND DO TESTING WITH US. WE PUT A SUIT ON THEM, THEY GET IN THE SEATS, AND THEN THEY ACTUALLY TELL US WHERE THE HAND CONTROLLER NEEDS TO BE SO THEY CAN REACH IT WHILE THEY’RE SEATED DURING LAUNCH. BECAUSE YOU CAN CALCULATE THE LENGTH OF SOMEONE’S ARM, BUT YOU DON’T REALLY KNOW HOW COMFORTABLE THAT IS FOR A VARIETY OF PEOPLE. >> RIGHT. >> SO THE POINT OF HAVING A MOCKUP IS THE ASTRONAUTS THEMSELVES GET TO HAVE INPUT ON THE DESIGN FOR WHERE THINGS GO. >> AH, OKAY. SO HONING IN ON THAT JUST A LITTLE BIT, I MEAN, THAT’S-- JUST BECAUSE IT’S A NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER THING, WE HAVE A FACILITY HERE, BUILDING 9, RIGHT, THE SPACE VEHICLE MOCKUP FACILITY. AND WE HAVE SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, RIGHT, MOCKUPS OF ONE-TO-ONE SCALE VERSIONS OF WHAT YOU WOULD FIND ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, BUT IT KINDS OF GIVES YOU A LAY OF THE LAND, IN A WAY. >> YEAH, IT’S THE SAME CONCEPT THAT’S BEEN USED FOR DECADES. AND BUILDING 9 SORT OF EVOLVES WITH THE PROGRAMS. I THINK THEY DID APOLLO WORK IN IT WAY BACK IN THE DAY, AND THEN IT HAD A SPACE SHUTTLE, AND NOW IT HAS ISS AND ORION AND THE COMMERCIAL CREW VEHICLES ALL IN THERE. SO IT’S KIND OF A COOL FACILITY. IT’S LIKE A PLAYGROUND FOR SPACESHIPS. BUT YEAH, THAT’S WHERE THE ASTRONAUTS AND EVERYONE CAN GET IN AND REALLY SEE WHAT’S GOING ON. >> YEAH, AND SO FOR ORION, I MEAN, THAT’S A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES, AND THEY ALL SERVE A DIFFERENT PURPOSE. SO IS THERE SO MANY BECAUSE THERE’S JUST DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO? ARE YOU DOING MULTIPLE TESTS IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS? LIKE WHAT’S THE LOGIC BEHIND HAVING SO MANY TEST ARTICLES? >> WELL, THE DIFFERENT TEST ARTICLES ARE REALLY BUILT FOR THAT SPECIFIC FUNCTION, RIGHT? >> AH, I SEE. >> LIKE WE DON'T’ NEED TO BUILD A COMPLETE ORION. THAT WOULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE. SO YOU BUILD ONE THAT’S STRUCTURALLY ACCURATE, AND YOU GO DO ALL THE STRUCTURES TESTING, BUT YOU DON’T MOUNT ALL THE AVIONICS AND COMPUTERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IN IT. THEY DON’T NEED TO BE THERE FOR THAT KIND OF TESTING. >> EXACTLY. >> AND WHEN WE BUILD THE ONE IN BUILDING 9, WE DON’T REALLY BUILD THE RIGHT SHELL, BECAUSE THAT’S REALLY EXPENSIVE. SO WE BUILD BASICALLY A PLASTIC-- AND WE’VE USED 3D PRINTED PARTS TO REPRESENT THAT SHELL, BUT YOU REALLY WANT THE INSIDE TO BE ACCURATE. AND IT DOESN’T HAVE TO BE FUNCTIONAL, BUT YOU NEED THE BOX THE RIGHT SHAPE, FOR EXAMPLE. >> YEAH. >> SO WE USE DIFFERENT ONES BECAUSE FIRST OFF, YOU NEED TO DO A LOT OF THAT TESTING IN PARALLEL. WE CAN’T JUST BUILD ONE AND HAVE IT MOVE FROM FACILITY TO FACILITY. BUT YOU BUILD EACH MOCKUP OR TEST ARTICLE SO IT’S PURPOSED FOR THAT, AND WE CAN HAVE A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON AT ONCE-- AND THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON AT ONCE. >> SOUNDS LIKE IT, ABSOLUTELY. SO I MEAN, IS THERE A VERSION RIGHT NOW THAT EXISTS THAT HAS ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS TOGETHER? >> NO, BUT WE’RE BUILDING-- THE REAL EXPLORATION MISSION 1 ORION IS ALREADY UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT THE OPERATIONS AND CHECKOUT BUILDING AT THE KENNEDY SPACE CENTER. >> ALL RIGHT! >> SO THE REAL ORION CREW MODULE IS ALREADY THERE, AND I THINK PART OF THE CREW MODULE ADAPTER IS THERE. SO THEY’RE ACTUALLY STARTING TO PUT THE REAL PIECES TOGETHER. AND THE ONLY COMPLETE VEHICLE WILL BE THE ONE YOU FLY. >> ALL RIGHT, YEAH. SO THAT ONE’S GOING TO BE FOR-- I MEAN, IT’S ANOTHER TEST, BUT REALLY IT’S COMPLETE, RIGHT? >> RIGHT. >> SO EM-1-- I MEAN, WE CAN SKIP AROUND. I KNOW WE HAVE LIKE KIND OF A MODEL OF HOW WE WANT TO HAVE THIS GO, BUT I MEAN, EM-1, WHAT IS THAT? THAT’S ANOTHER FLIGHT TEST, RIGHT? >> YEAH, SO EXPLORATION MISSION 1 REALLY KIND OF IS THE ULTIMATE FLIGHT TEST. IT HAS EVERYTHING BUT THE PEOPLE. >> AH! >> AND SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT THE CREW NEEDS, RIGHT? WE’RE NOT PUTTING THE COMPLETE LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM ON BECAUSE THE CREW ISN’T ON THERE. >> SURE. >> BUT THE REST OF THE VEHICLE, FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES, IS COMPLETE. SO THAT IS THE ULTIMATE FLIGHT TEST, SO, RIGHT, EVEN THOUGH WE’RE DOING ALL THIS TESTING ON THE GROUND WE’VE STILL GOT ONE GIANT TEST TO DO IN SPACE BECAUSE THINGS DON’T ALWAYS WORK IN SPACE LIKE THEY DO ON THE GROUND. SO WE DO HAVE TO REALLY FINISH THE TESTING IN SPACE BEFORE WE PUT CREW ON. SO EXPLORATION MISSION 1 IS THAT FIRST UNCREWED FLIGHT TEST BEFORE WE GIVE IT THE THUMBS UP TO PUT PEOPLE ON. >> THERE YOU GO. AND YOU HAVE ALL THE DIFFERENT TESTS COMING TOGETHER, RIGHT, SO YOU HAVE ALL THAT VIBRATION TESTING, THE STRUCTURAL TESTS, ALL THE ONES YOU WERE HINTING AT, THE INTERIOR WHATEVER-- ALL JAM PACKED INTO THIS ONE EVERYTHING WORKS, HERE IT IS MISSION. SO-- EXCEPT THE PEOPLE, OBVIOUSLY. >> RIGHT. >> YEAH. >> AND IT’S A MODEL USED ACROSS ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS, RIGHT-- AEROSPACE INDUSTRY, OTHER SPACECRAFT. EVERYONE HAS TO DO TESTING BEFORE YOU’RE READY TO PUT PEOPLE ON SOMETHING. >> YEAH. OKAY, AND THE MISSION PROFILE-- WE CAN GET INTO IT LATER IN THE PODCAST TOO, BUT THE MISSION PROFILE IS WHAT? WHERE IS IT GOING TO GO? >> SO WE’RE INTENDING TO SEND EXPLORATION MISSION 1 OUT TO THE MOON IN WHAT’S CALLED A DISTANT RETROGRADE ORBIT. SO DISTANT MEANING WE’RE REALLY HIGH UP FROM THE MOON, SO HIGH ALTITUDE ORBIT AROUND THE MOON. >> OH, OKAY. >> AND RETROGRADE MEANS YOU ACTUALLY ORBIT OPPOSITE THE DIRECTION THE MOON IS DOING. >> OH, OKAY. >> SO IF YOU LOOKED AT THE MOON FROM THE NORTH POLE OF EARTH, IT’S MOVING COUNTERCLOCKWISE, AND OUR ORBIT AROUND THE MOON IS MOVING CLOCKWISE, SO THAT’S THE RETROGRADE. SO THAT’S THE DISTANT RETROGRADE ORBIT. IT’S A VERY STABLE ORBIT. IT DOESN’T REQUIRE A LOT OF PROPULSION TO GET INTO AND OUT OF, AND SO THAT’S WHY WE’RE JUST USING IT-- IT’S A GOOD STAND-IN TO DO TESTING AND HAVE A STEADY STATE CONDITION TO MAKE SURE WE’RE TESTING EVERYTHING OUT. SO THAT’S OUR DESTINATION, BUT THE WHOLE MISSION SHOULD BE BETWEEN 26 AND 42 DAYS LONG, SO WE HAVE LOTS OF TIME TO TEST THINGS OUT. AND THEN WHEN WE COME BACK TO EARTH WE’RE GOING TO DO A 25,000 MILE PER HOUR REENTRY AND DO THE ENTIRE ENTRY WITH ALL THE HEAT SHIELD AND EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO CONFIRM IT’S WORKING AND ALL OUR MODELS ARE RIGHT BEFORE THE CREW FLIES. >> OH, WOW, OKAY. SO I’M THINKING WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT MISSION PROFILE, THE ONE THAT CAME TO MIND WAS APOLLO 8. THAT ONE HAD PEOPLE ON IT, RIGHT? >> IT DID. >> BUT IT WENT AROUND THE MOON AND THEN CAME BACK, BUT IT DIDN’T LAND ON THE MOON. >> RIGHT, APOLLO 8 DIDN’T LAND ON THE MOON. SO ALL OF THE APOLLO MISSIONS, THEY HAD A VERY DEFINED TARGET: LAND ON THE MOON. >> OBVIOUSLY, YEAH. >> SO IF YOU GO BACK THROUGH ALL THE APOLLO MISSIONS THAT LED UP TO IT, EACH ONE ACHIEVED ANOTHER OBJECTIVE TOWARDS THE MOON LANDING. >> YES, ALL STEPPING STONES, YEAH. >> AND APOLLO 8 WAS THE FIRST DEMONSTRATION OF ACTUALLY SENDING A VEHICLE FROM EARTH TO THE MOON AND PROVING THAT THAT COULD BE DONE. >> RIGHT. >> SO IT HAD PEOPLE ON BOARD. THEY DIDN’T HAVE AS MUCH ADVANCED COMPUTERS AND COMMUNICATIONS THAT WE HAVE NOW, SO THEY COULD NOT HAVE ACHIEVED THAT MISSION WITHOUT PEOPLE ONBOARD. >> OH, YEAH. >> WE CAN NOW WITH COMPUTERS, SO THAT’S WHY WE CAN DO THIS AS AN UNCREWED DEMONSTRATION BEFORE WE PUT PEOPLE ON. >> OKAY, SO IS IT SIMILAR-- IS IT LIKE-- I DON’T KNOW THE EXACT DETAILS, BUT DID APOLLO 8 ALSO DO A RETROGRADE ORBIT? >> SO APOLLO 8, YES, IT WAS RETROGRADE, BUT THEY DID GO DOWN TO A LOW LUNAR ORBIT. SO THEY WERE WITHIN 100 KILOMETERS OF THE SURFACE. >> YEAH. >> AND WE’LL FLY BY IT 100 KILOMETERS FROM THE SURFACE JUST WHEN WE’RE DOING THE POWERED FLY-BY, BUT WE’RE NOT GOING INTO A LOW ORBIT LIKE THAT. >> SO WE’RE-- YEAH, THIS IS A BIGGER-- IT’S KIND OF ELLIPTICAL, TOO, RIGHT? IT’S GOING TO GO WAY OUT PAST THE MOON? >> YEAH, IT’S 70,000 KILOMETERS ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE MOON. >> YEAH. >> SO WE’RE WAY PAST WHERE ANY OF THE APOLLO MISSIONS WENT. AND THAT’S BECAUSE WE’RE WORKING TOWARDS A GATEWAY ARCHITECTURE IN THE FUTURE OF A STAGING GROUND FOR DEVELOPMENT OF MARS MISSIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO IT’S A DIFFERENT PURPOSE THAN ACTUALLY AN OBJECTIVE TO LAND ON THE MOON. >> BUT IT’S KIND OF THE SAME THING IN APOLLO 8 WHERE BEFORE YOU CAN LAND ON THE MOON, BEFORE YOU CAN GET TO YOUR DEEP SPACE OBJECTIVE, YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING WORKS FIRST. SO IT’S JUST ANOTHER TEST. >> YEAH, AND APOLLO HAD MULTIPLE FLIGHTS IN LOW EARTH ORBIT BEFORE THEY EVEN WENT AND DID APOLLO 8. SO THEY HAD SEVERAL UNCREWED FLIGHTS, AND THEN APOLLO 7 WAS ACTUALLY THE FIRST CREWED FLIGHT, AND IT STAYED IN LOW EARTH ORBIT BEFORE APOLLO 8. SO THEY GOT TO HAVE LOTS OF TEST FLIGHTS. SO WE’RE RELYING ON A LITTLE BIT LEANER OF A TEST FLIGHT STRATEGY BECAUSE WE CAN DO MORE GROUND TESTING RIGHT NOW. >> AND LIKE YOU SAID, WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY WHERE WE CAN COLLECT THE DATE WE NEED WITHOUT-- >> YEAH, SO I MEAN, APOLLO’S COMPUTERS WERE SOMETHING LIKE-- YOU KNOW, LESS POWER THAN THOSE CALCULATOR WATCHES, RIGHT? SO THERE WAS ONLY SO MUCH THAT THEY COULD DO. THAT WAS-- THEY REALLY INVENTED COMPUTERS AND MICROPROCESSORS AND STUFF LIKE THAT WEREN’T REALLY AROUND YET. SO NOW WE’VE GOT SUPER ADVANCED COMPUTERS. WE CAN AUTOMATE A LOT OF STUFF IN SOFTWARE THAT YOU COULD’VE NEVER DONE IN THE APOLLO DAYS. SO WE’RE ACTUALLY AUTOMATING A LOT OF THE VEHICLE IN SOFTWARE SO THAT CRITICAL ACTIONS LIKE BURNS CAN BE DONE WITHOUT GROUND INTERVENTION. >> OH. >> BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE BURNS HAPPEN ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE MOON WHERE YOU HAVE NO CONTACT WITH EARTH. >> RIGHT. >> SO WE’VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT SOFTWARE ONBOARD THE VEHICLE, WHEREAS FOR APOLLO THOSE WERE LITERALLY MANUALLY CONDUCTED BURNS WHERE THE ASTRONAUTS WERE TRIGGERING THE ENGINES AND STUFF. SO I MEAN, THAT’S ONE EXAMPLE OF WHY WE CAN DO THAT WITHOUT PEOPLE NOW, AND THEY COULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT ON APOLLO. >> YEAH, EXACTLY. SO I MEAN, GOING BACK TO ORION, WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE OVERALL VIEW OF IT AND HOW IT’S KIND OF STRUCTURED AND SHAPED. LET’S KIND OF GO INSIDE FOR A SECOND. HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN GO IN ORION? >> SO WE CAN TAKE UP TO FOUR PEOPLE. THAT’S WHAT OUR DESIGN IS FOR. BUT APOLLO DID THREE. BUT WE’VE GOT WAY MORE ROOM STILL INSIDE FOR THE CREW, BECAUSE WITH THE ADVANCES IN STRUCTURE, RIGHT? SO WE CAN USE CARBON FIBER STRUCTURE, AND OUR COMPUTERS ARE OBVIOUSLY MUCH SMALLER THAN THEY WERE IN THE ‘60s. >> YEAH. >> SO SPACEWISE THE CREW HAS A LOT OF ROOM TO MOVE AROUND. YOU CAN ACTUALLY STAND FULL HEIGHT IF YOU’RE STANDING ON THE BACK PLANE WHERE THE LOCKERS ARE IN THE DOCKING TUNNEL. SO YOU CAN STAND UP IN ORION. >> WOW. >> AND IN APOLLO,  YOU REALLY ONLY SORT OF HAD THREE BEDS OR CHAIRS WHERE THEY GOT INTO WHEN THEY LAUNCHED, AND YOUR SPACE WAS BASICALLY ARM’S REACH BETWEEN YOUR BACK AND THE CONTROL PANEL. >> TIGHT SQUEEZE. >> SO WE’VE GOT A LITTLE BIT MORE COMFORTABLE RIDE FOR THE CREW, BUT IT’LL STILL BE A LONG HAUL ON A LONG MISSION. >> IS THAT THE LOGIC BEHIND THE DESIGN, TOO? IS IT FOR COMFORT, OR IS THERE OTHER STUFF THAT YOU’RE TRYING TO PUT IN THERE? BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE SMALLER COMPUTERS, MORE SPACE, MORE PEOPLE-- WHAT ELSE-- WHAT’S THE LOGIC BEHIND IT? >> IT’S NOT SO MUCH COMFORT, BUT TO SUPPORT A LITTLE BIT LONGER MISSION. SO WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO 21 DAYS-- 4 CREW FOR 21 DAYS IN JUST ORION. >> WOW. >> SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH FOOD AND CLOTHING AND PERSONAL HYGIENE SPACE YOU NEED FOR STUFF LIKE THAT, THERE’S ACTUALLY RULES THAT NASA HAS ABOUT HOW MUCH VOLUME PER CREW MEMBER THAT YOU NEED. SO WE’RE MEETING THOSE REQUIREMENTS. SO FOR A THREE WEEK MISSION YOU NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE VOLUME IF THAT’S THE ONLY SPACE YOU HAVE TO MOVE AROUND IN. SO WE’RE MEETING THOSE REQUIREMENTS. IT’S NOT LIKE WE’RE DESIGNING FOR COMFORT-- WE’RE DESIGNING TO ACHIEVE THOSE EXPLORATION GOALS AND MAKING SURE HUMANS ARE COMFORTABLE AND CAN ACHIEVE THE MISSION SAFELY. >> WELL, I THINK HAVING A LOT OF SPACE, A LITTLE EXTRA LEGROOM, AND ENOUGH FOOD FOR THE WHOLE MISSION, I THINK, IS PRETTY MUCH ALL COMFORT STUFF. >> KIND OF IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO EAT. >> KIND OF, YEAH. OKAY, SO WE’RE TALKING ABOUT 21 DAY MISSIONS, WE’RE TALKING ABOUT GOING OUTSIDE THE MOON. IS THIS-- CAN THIS BE A LOW EARTH ORBIT VEHICLE, OR IS THAT NOT PART OF THE VEHICLE? LIKE CAN IT GO TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION? >> SO WHEN ORION WAS FIRST CONCEIVED IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO DO BOTH ISS AND LUNAR ORBIT. BUT WE’VE SINCE MOVED ON PAST THAT. WE’RE NOW TRYING TO DO THE COMMERCIAL CREW PROGRAM TO REALLY GO TO ISS. >> YEAH. >> AND IT’S REALLY KIND OF HAVING VEHICLES DESIGNED FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES, RIGHT? YOU CAN DRIVE TO WORK IN YOUR GIANT 4X4 PICKUP WITH A CAMPER AND STUFF LIKE THAT. AND THAT’S LIKE ORION, RIGHT? >> RIGHT. >> BIG CAMPING TRIP, LOTS OF SUPPLIES, THINGS LIKE THAT. YOU COULD GO TO THE ISS IN IT, BUT IT’S NOT A GOOD USE OF THE VEHICLE, RIGHT? >> AH, YEAH. >> WE’RE TRYING TO DO THE EXPLORATION OBJECTIVES, SO WE’VE GOT A LOT MORE STUFF AND A LOT MORE CAPABILITY. AND IT’S BETTER TO USE IT FOR EXPLORATION, AND THEN THE COMMERCIAL CREW CAN DESIGN FOR THE SPECIFIC VEHICLE-- IT’S LIKE YOUR CIVIC YOU DRIVE TO WORK IN. YOU ONLY NEED A CAR TO GET TO THE SPACE STATION. YOU NEED A BIG TRUCK WITH ALL YOUR CAMPING SUPPLIES TO DO EXPLORATION. SO THERE’S REALLY A PURPOSE DIFFERENCE. SO YES, YOU COULD GO TO ISS WITH IT, BUT THAT’S NOT REALLY WHAT WE’RE TRYING TO DO. >> I LOVE THAT ANALOGY, BY THE WAY. I MEAN, AS MUCH AS I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE A CLASS A TRAILER TO WORK EVERY DAY-- [ LAUGHTER ] THAT’D BE PRETTY AWESOME. IT WOULD BE A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY AND RESOURCES. >> IT’S A LITTLE BIT OF OVERKILL FOR THE MISSION YOU’RE TRYING TO DO. >> EXACTLY, THAT’S A PERFECT WAY OF DESCRIBING IT. SO I MEAN, YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT AN RV, A CAMPER, PRETTY MUCH, BUT A SPACE VERSION THAT’S GOING TO GO WAY OUT. SO YOU’RE GOING TO BE GOING ON THESE BIG SPACE CAMPING TRIPS, YOU’RE GOING TO NEED A LOT OF FOOD AND STUFF. IS IT GOING TO BE SIMILAR TO INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION FOOD? ARE YOU DESIGNING A SORT OF-- I DON’T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT, BUT A-- IS IT GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, OR ARE YOU TAKING SOME OF THOSE LESSONS? >> I THINK THEY’RE USING A LOT OF THE SAME FOODS FROM THE SPACE STATION. I MEAN, THE CREW, THEY’VE DONE A LOT OF TESTING ON WHAT FOOD THEY GET AT THE SPACE STATION. NOW, ORION, WE’RE A LOT MORE SPACE CONSTRAINED AND MASS CONSTRAINED BECAUSE WHATEVER WE PUT ON, WHATEVER POUND YOU PUT ON THE VEHICLE, YOU’VE GOT TO SEND THAT TO THE MOON. SO THAT’S MORE PROP, MORE RESOURCES, MORE SPACE. >> RIGHT. >> SO I THINK THEY’VE DONE A LOT MORE ADVANCED WORK ON ENERGY BARS, BASICALLY. SO COMPACT-- YOU KNOW, THERE’S LIKE 700 OR 800 CALORIES IN A BAR. >> WOW. >> THAT’S A WHOLE MEAL REPLACEMENT. NOW, I CAN FIT THAT IN ORION SO AT LEAST ONCE A DAY I THINK THEY’LL HAVE THESE ENERGY BARS VERSUS A WHOLE MEAL WITH THE-- EVEN THE FREEZE DRIED FOOD THEY’LL STILL HAVE, BUT WE ARE TRYING TO CONDENSE DOWN A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT WE CAN TAKE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO FIT IT IN A SMALLER VEHICLE. >> OH, OKAY, YEAH. >> BUT THE FOOD SCIENTISTS ARE STILL DOING A LOT OF WORK, AND WE’RE BUILDING OFF OF WHAT ISS HAD. >> YEAH. I MEAN, IT’S THAT WHOLE IDEA OF “MASS IS MONEY.” SO YOU’VE GOT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WEIGHT THAT YOU’VE GOT TO PLAN FOR, SO YOU’VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT MEALS ARE REALLY TINY AND DON’T TAKE UP A LOT OF SPACE BUT ARE JAM PACKED FULL OF CALORIES AND CAN REALLY MEET THOSE CALORIC NEEDS THAT THE ASTRONAUTS NEED. >> YEAH, AND IN GETTING OUT OF LOW EARTH ORBIT AND GETTING TO THE MOON, I THINK YOU NEED LIKE TEN TIMES THE AMOUNT OF PROP DO THAT, RIGHT? >> YEAH. >> YOU NEED SO MUCH PROP TO GET INTO LOW EARTH ORBIT, AND THEN YOU NEED TEN TIMES THAT TO LEAVE LOW EARTH ORBIT. SO IT HAS A MULTIPLYING EFFECT FOR EVERY POUND YOU ADD. SO ONE POUND, GETTING IT TO ISS IS “EASY,” QUOTE UNQUOTE, BUT YOU NEED THAT MUCH MORE FOR EVERY POUND YOU SEND TO THE MOON. >> RIGHT, YEAH. I LIKE THAT QUOTE UNQUOTE, BECAUSE GOING TO SPACE IS NOT AN EASY THING. >> ABSOLUTELY NOT. >> BUT NOW YOU’RE PLANNING FOR THINGS THAT HAVE THIS TENFOLD FACTOR. >> RIGHT. >> SO PRETTY CRAZY. SO WHAT ABOUT-- I MEAN, GOING BACK INSIDE, YOU SAID THEY HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM TO SLEEP AND STUFF. WHAT ABOUT-- IS EXERCISE A CONCERN? BECAUSE I KNOW EXERCISE, THEY HAVE TO DO IT ALMOST TWO, TWO AND A HALF HOURS A DAY ON THE SPACE STATION. ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING SIMILAR FOR THESE 21 DAY MISSIONS? >> SO WE DO HAVE TO FIT IN AN EXERCISE DEVICE. WE’RE REALLY TRYING TO GET THEM TO GIVE US A REALLY COMPACT EXERCISE DEVICE. >> AH. >> BECAUSE YOU’VE GOT ROOM, BUT YOU’RE GOING TO BE TRYING TO DO EXERCISE WITH THREE PEOPLE AROUND YOU IN A SMALL CABIN, AND TRYING TO DO A PULL UP AND YOU’LL BE SMACKING YOUR CREW MEMBER IN THE FACE, RIGHT? SO WE’RE TRYING TO WORK ON A COMPACT EXERCISE DEVICE, AND THEY HAVE WAYS TO DO THAT. YOU REALLY NEED A LOT OF EXERCISE EQUIPMENT WHEN YOU’RE DOING LONG DURATION MISSIONS LIKE ON ISS. SO SIX MONTHS, THEY’VE GOT THE TREADMILL, THEY’VE GOT THIS THING CALLED THE RED, OR IRED, WHICH IS LIKE A WEIGHT LIFTING DEVICE. SO WHEN YOU’RE DOING LONG DURATION MISSIONS YOU NEED A LOT OF EXERCISE EQUIPMENT. THAT STUFF DOESN’T FIT IN ORION. >> YEAH. >> YOU NEED SOME SHORT TERM, SMALLER, COMPACT EXERCISE EQUIPMENT IN ORION. AND THEN IF YOU BUILD A GATEWAY AROUND THE MOON KIND OF LIKE A MINI STATION, THEN YOU NEED TO PUT YOUR BIG EXERCISE EQUIPMENT ON THAT FOR A LONGER MISSION. >> AH, OKAY. >> SO WE’VE ALL GOT TO SORT OF DO OUR PART IN OUR PEAKS. >> YEAH. SO I MEAN, 21 DAYS IS A LITTLE BIT SHORT OF A MISSION. I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THESE EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION BECAUSE THERE’S SOME CERTAIN THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN THE BODY OVER A SIX MONTH TIME. IS THERE THINGS YOU KNOW OF THAT HAPPENS TO THE BODY IN A 21 DAY TIME? AND I’M SURE YOU’RE PLANNING FOR THAT IN YOUR EXERCISE EQUIPMENT, BUT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE FOR THE HUMAN BODY IN SPACE? >> YEAH, SO I KNOW FROM THE SURGEONS AND THE MEDICAL DOCTORS, THEY SEE DEGRADATION IN THE HUMAN BODY EVEN OVER JUST TWO TO THREE WEEKS. >> OH, WOW. >> SO EVEN OVER A SHORT TIME FRAME, LIKE, SAY, THE SHUTTLE FLIGHTS-- SAME THING. THE CREW WAS STILL DOING EXERCISES EVEN THOUGH THE MISSION WAS ONLY A COUPLE WEEKS LONG SO THEY DIDN’T COME BACK DECONDITIONED WITH MUSCLE LOSS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. >> YEAH. >> SO WE’VE STILL GOT TO DO THAT. SO THEY DO SEE DECONDITIONING IN THE HUMAN BODY WITHIN A WEEK OF BEING IN ORBIT. SO YOU CAN’T LET IT GO AND IGNORE IT, BUT YOU DON’T HAVE TO DO AS MUCH AS A SIX MONTH MISSION. >> RIGHT, YEAH. SO I MEAN, YOU TALKED ABOUT IT BEING SORT OF A SPACE CAMPER, SPACE RV. THAT’S A GREAT WAY TO DESCRIBE THE VEHICLE THAT’S MEANT FOR, LIKE YOU SAID, THE MISSION OF GOING OUT INTO DEEP SPACE. WHAT ELSE ABOUT ORION MAKES IT A GOOD VEHICLE FOR THOSE TYPE OF MISSION, FOR DEEP SPACE MISSIONS? >> SO ONE OF THE THINGS WITH ORION THAT’S VERY HARD TO DO BUT WE’RE TRYING TO IS WE MAKE IT CAPABLE OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT ORBITS, OR DESTINATIONS, OR MISSION TIMELINES, RIGHT? SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE DRO. WE’RE LOOKING AT OTHER KINDS OF ORBITS SO WHATEVER CROPS UP IN THE FUTURE, ORION CAN SUPPORT. SO WE’RE TRYING TO BUILD IN SOME FLEXIBILITY. >> AH. >> AND THEN THE OTHER KEY PIECE OF ORION IS TO BE ABLE TO ABORT AND COME HOME. >> AH. >> SO IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM, WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TURN AROUND AND GET THE CREW BACK, AND DO THAT WITHIN A FEW DAYS. WHEN YOU COME BACK FROM THE SPACE STATION IF THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY, IT’S A MATTER OF HOURS. IT’S LIKE ONE TO THREE HOURS, AND YOU CAN BE ON THE GROUND. SO IT’S NOT LIKE A TRUE EMERGENCY YOU’VE GOT TO HAVE TONS OF SUPPLIES. BUT THE FASTEST YOU CAN GET HOME FROM THE MOON IS THREE TO FIVE DAYS. >> OKAY. >> SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE, IN AN EMERGENCY, STILL HAVE THE SUPPLIES ONBOARD, THE VEHICLE CAPABLE OF-- IF YOU, SAY, LOSE AN OXYGEN TANK, YOU’VE GOT TO HAVE ANOTHER ONE TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE THE MULTIPLE DAY TRIP HOME. SO THAT’S THE KIND OF CHALLENGES, IS WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT THERE, AND THEN WE ALSO NEED TO BE ABLE TO SAFELY COME HOME. >> WOW, SO IT’S REDUNDANCY, BUT THEN YOU ALREADY HINTED AT BEFORE THAT MASS IS MONEY. AND YOU ONLY HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MASS-- NOW YOU HAVE TO BUILD IN THESE REDUNDANCIES. NOW THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN PUT ON THE VEHICLE ARE RESTRICTED. I CAN SEE HOW THIS CAN REALLY SPIRAL, ALL THESE CHALLENGES. >> IT IS, IT’S A BIG SNOWBALL EFFECT. >> RIGHT. >> IT’S HOW MANY EMERGENCIES DO YOU PROTECT FOR, WHAT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS THAT YOU CAN THINK OF THAT YOU NEED TO COVER FOR. AND THEN AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO JUST REALIZE THERE’S RISK. >> YEAH. >> IT IS A RISKY THING TO DO TO SEND PEOPLE TO THE MOON, AND AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO DRAW THE LINE AND SAY, “OKAY, THESE ARE THE RISKS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE TO DO THIS AT ALL.” >> YEAH, YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THE RISK BECAUSE YOU’RE RIGHT-- THIS IS NEW. THAT’S THE WHOLE PART OF EXPLORING, RIGHT, IS YOU’RE TRYING TO-- THERE’S ONLY SO MUCH THAT YOU CAN JUST PLAN FOR BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE IN DISCOVERY MODE, TOO. >> RIGHT. SO WE TRY TO BUILD IN REDUNDANCIES TO COVER FOR A VARIETY OF CAUSES, BUT AT SOME POINT YOU’RE DONE-- YOU CAN’T PUT FIVE OXYGEN TANKS ONBOARD JUST IN CASE, RIGHT? >> YEAH. >> WE’VE GOT TO MAKE SURE WE KNOW WHAT WE’RE DESIGNING FOR AND TRY TO COVER THE SITUATIONS WE CAN PLAN FOR. >> YEAH. SO YOU HINTED AT BEFORE THAT IT’S COMPARABLE TO THE APOLLO CAPSULE. SO HOW IS IT SIMILAR, HOW IS IT DIFFERENT? >> SO SIMILAR, THE SHAPE. OBVIOUSLY-- YOU CAN LOOK AT IT. WE DRAW A LOT FROM THOSE LESSONS LEARNED FROM APOLLO. THE SHAPE OF THE CAPSULE IS THE SAME. WE BOTH HAVE A SERVICE MODULE. BUT THEN WE’VE HAD A LOT OF ADVANCES IN THE STRUCTURES AND THE COMPUTERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT, AND THEN A FEW OTHER THINGS. APOLLO USED FUEL CELLS, HAD A VERY SHORT MISSION LIFETIME POSSIBLE AS A RESULT. WE’RE USING SOLAR ARRAYS, WHICH WILL ENABLE LONGER DURATION MISSIONS, BECAUSE ONCE YOU GO OVER A FEW WEEKS MISSION DURATION, YOUR SOLAR ARRAYS WILL CONTINUE GENERATING POWER. IT’S FREE ENERGY FROM THE SUN. >> YEAH! >> SO THAT’S LIKE ANOTHER OBVIOUS DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO THINGS. AND THEN WE’RE USING THINGS LIKE WE HAVE A-- IT’S CALLED AN ENCAPSULATED SERVICE MODULE. WE PUT FAIRINGS ON TO PROTECT THE SOLAR ARRAYS DURING LAUNCH BECAUSE OF THE AERODYNAMICS OF THE WIND THAT WOULD RIP THEM OFF. >> OH, YEAH. >> AND SO THEN WE JETTISON THE FAIRINGS ON ASCENT. SO APOLLO DIDN’T HAVE THAT. THEIR SERVICE MODULE WAS THE EXTERNAL STRUCTURE. >> RIGHT. >> SO THERE’S A FEW OTHER DIFFERENCES, RIGHT-- WE HAVE A BIG LAUNCH ABORT TOWER ON TOP. APOLLO DID AS WELL. I THINK OURS WE’VE DESIGNED A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. BUT ALL IN ALL IT’S STILL-- THE SHAPE IS VERY MUCH THE SAME. AND WE CAN DO LONGER, RIGHT? THE 4 PEOPLE, 21 DAYS. APOLLO WAS 3 CREW FOR LIKE 14, STUFF LIKE THAT. AND THEN WE’RE DESIGNED TO BE ABLE TO DOCK WITH OTHER THINGS. SO WHEN WE START BUILDING A HABITAT OR SOMETHING, YOU CAN BE OUT THERE FOR MONTHS AT A TIME. >> RIGHT. >> SO ONCE YOU HAVE ANOTHER HABITAT, THEN ORION WITH ITS SOLAR ARRAYS CAN JUST HANG OUT AND WAIT THROUGH LONGER MISSIONS. >> YEAH. >> SO WE’RE TRYING TO BUILD IN A MULTI-MONTH CAPABILITY IN A QUIESCENT STATE SO YOU CAN DO LONG DURATION MISSIONS OUT NEAR THE MOON. AND THAT IS NOT SOMETHING APOLLO COULD HAVE DONE. >> YEAH. SO IF YOU WERE TO JUST LOOK AT IT, YOU’D BE LIKE, “YEAH, IT’S  BIG APOLLO.” BUT IT’S THESE LITTLE DETAILS THAT ARE REALLY MAKE OR BREAK, YEAH, FOR THE MISSION. I MEAN, IF YOU DON’T HAVE THIS SORT OF-- I MEAN, IF IT DOESN’T JETTISON THIS THING RIGHT IT’S NOT GOING TO WORK. IF IT DOESN’T HAVE THIS MUCH POWER, IT’S NOT GOING TO WORK. SO IT’S ALL IN THESE DETAILS THAT REALLY MAKE OR BREAK THE MISSION. SO IT LOOKS LIKE JUST A CAPSULE FLYING THROUGH SPACE, BUT THERE’S A MILLION THINGS THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN FOR IT TO WORK SUCCESSFULLY. >> YEAH, THE CHANGE AND WHAT YOU’RE TRYING TO DO WITH IT DRIVES A LOT OF DESIGN DECISIONS. I MEAN, THAT IS THE ENGINEERING PROCESS, IS YOU GIVE YOURSELF A GOAL, AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU’RE DOWN THIS RABBITHOLE OF “WELL, IF I WANT THAT I’LL HAVE TO DO THIS DIFFERENTLY.” >> RIGHT. >> SO THE POWER SYSTEM IS A GOOD EXAMPLE. IF YOU WANT A LONG DURATION MISSION, YOU NEED ARRAYS THAT DON’T REQUIRE CONSUMABLES. FUEL CELLS REQUIRE HYDROGEN TO FEED THEM, AND SO YOU CAN ONLY DO MISSIONS OF HOWEVER MUCH HYDROGEN YOU HAVE ONBOARD FOR YOUR FUEL CELL. IF YOU HAVE A RAIS, WELL, NOW I CAN DO LONG MISSIONS. SO THAT IS A-- THAT DRIVES ALL YOUR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN DECISIONS WHEN YOU MAKE THOSE SORT OF OBJECTIVES. >> MM-HMM. SO IN THE BEGINNING WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT IS ORION, YOU KIND OF DESCRIBED THE SHAPE OF IT, WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, AND THEN YOU SAID, “THERE’S THIS BARREL BEHIND IT,” YOU SAID, THE SERVICE MODULE. WHAT ROLE DOES THAT PLAY IN ALL OF THIS? >> SO THE SERVICE MODULE IS CRITICAL TO ORION’S DEEP SPACE ACTIVITY. SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE CREW MODULE, THAT’S GOT OUR COMPUTERS, SO THAT’S THE HEART OF THE VEHICLE. IT’S THE PRESSURIZED VOLUME FOR THE CREW TO STAY IN, AND IT’S ALSO THE PIECE WITH THE HEAT SHIELDING AND THE PARACHUTES THAT LAND THE CREW SAFELY. BUT ON ITS OWN IT CAN ONLY STAY ALIVE FOR A FEW HOURS BECAUSE IT’S GOT THE BATTERIES, BUT THAT’S ONLY A COUPLE OF HOURS WORTH OF POWER IN THEM. SO WITH THE SERVICE MODULE YOU HAVE THE MAIN PROPULSION SYSTEM-- THAT’S HOW YOU’RE GOING TO GET HOME FROM THE MOON, AND HOW YOU’RE GOING TO CONTROL YOUR FLIGHT TO GET THERE-- KIND OF IMPORTANT. >> YEAH. >> IT HAS ALL OF THE CREW CONSUMABLES-- OXYGEN, NITROGEN, AND WATER TANKS. >> OH, OKAY. >> SO THAT’S FEEDING THE CREW MODULE FOR THE CREW WHILE YOU’RE UP THERE. IT’S GOT THE RADIATORS. TO THE CREW-- THE AVIONICS COMPUTERS GENERATE A LOT OF HEAT, SO WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THAT BECAUSE THE CREW NEEDS A CABIN THAT’S COMFORTABLE. YOU CAN’T HAVE THAT 100 DEGREES. IT WOULD BE HORRIBLE TO WORK IN, RIGHT? SO WE HAVE TO AIR CONDITION THE CABIN, WE HAVE TO GET RID OF ALL OF THAT HEAT. SO IT RUNS THROUGH AMMONIA PIPES ON THE RADIATORS TO GET RID OF IT. AND THEN YOU’VE GOT YOUR POWER-- YOU’VE GOT OUR BIG SOLAR ARRAYS OUT THERE. SO THOSE-- ALL OF SORT OF YOUR MAIN FUNCTIONS FOR YOUR VEHICLE ARE BUILT INTO THE SERVICE MODULE, AND A LOT OF THOSE COME FROM THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY. >> RIGHT. >> SO WE’RE PARTNERS WITH THE EUROPEANS. THEY’RE BUILDING A HUGE PART OF ORION, AND A VERY CRITICAL PART, RIGHT? WE CAN’T FLY WITHOUT THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY’S PART OF THE SERVICE MODULE. >> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. BECAUSE THIS IS-- I MEAN, IS IT FAIR TO SAY IT TAKES PLACE-- DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION IS A MULTINATIONAL, INTERNATIONAL OBJECTIVE, AND WE’RE ALL KIND OF POOLING OUR RESOURCES TOGETHER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN, IN A WAY. >> YEAH, I MEAN, I THINK WE’VE HAD GREAT PARTNERSHIPS. >> YEAH. >> WE’VE LEARNED ALL THE WAY FROM APOLLO SOYUZ, TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, AND NOW LOOKING TO THE FUTURE-- WE ALL KIND OF HAVE THIS MODEL OF TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE THIS IS VERY HARD, IT’S VERY EXPENSIVE, AND ULTIMATELY IT BENEFITS ALL OF HUMANITY. >> YES. >> SO BEING IN PARTNERSHIP IN DOING IT IS VERY MUCH A KEY PART OF NASA’S PLANS. >> YEAH, BECAUSE ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE’RE LEARNING ALONG THE WAY TO MEET THIS GOAL WERE KIND OF INVENT-- SORT OF, IN A WAY, INVENTED TECHNOLOGIES, RIGHT? I KNOW JUST JAMES WEBB INVENTED A COUPLE OF TECHNOLOGIES IN ORDER TO MAKE JAMES WEBB BE JAMES WEBB, BUT YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING AND SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT YOU WOULDN’T NECESSARILY SOLVE IN OTHER SITUATIONS, BUT COULD BE APPLIED OTHER PLACES. >> YEAH, I MEAN, AND ONE OF THE KEY ONES GOING FORWARD IS WHEN YOU’RE, SAY, GOING TO MARS, YOU WANT TO CLOSE THE LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM. >> YEAH. >> YOU WANT TO RECYCLE ALL THE WATER. AND THEY’RE ALREADY DOING THIS ON THE SPACE STATION, AND SO THAT’S A KEY TECHNOLOGY THAT’S BEING DEVELOPED FOR FUTURE MISSIONS AND STUFF. >> RIGHT. >> SO A CLOSED LOOP LIFE CONTROL, BUT NOW IF YOU CAN PRESERVE WATER, THAT COULD BE A KEY TECHNOLOGY ON EARTH FOR A WATER STARVED REGION. SO IF YOU CAN IMPROVE ON THAT TECHNOLOGY, THERE’S THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THINGS ON EARTH BECAUSE WE’VE SOLVED PROBLEMS IN SPACE. >> YEAH. >> AND ENGINEERS REALLY NEED A CHALLENGE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SOLVE PROBLEMS, AND THERE’S A GOOD ONE FOR PEOPLE TO WORK ON. >> NOW, GOING BACK TO APOLLO, I KNOW FOR THEM, THEY BROUGHT ALL THE WATER THAT THEY NEEDED ON THEIR COUPLE DAY MISSION TO THE MOON AND BACK. IS ORION GOING TO HAVE A RECYCLING WATER PROCESS, OR IS IT GOING TO BRING WATER? >> SO ORION IS-- WE’RE NOT CLOSED LOOP. SO WE’RE AN OPEN LOOP SYSTEM, WE’RE BRINGING ALL THE WATER YOU NEED FOR THE 21 DAYS. THAT INCLUDES HYGIENE, THAT INCLUDES DRINKING WATER, AND REHYDRATING THE FOOD THEY’RE EATING. >> OKAY, YEAH. >> SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS, WE’RE BRINGING THE TANKS FULL OF WATER BECAUSE WE’RE DESIGNED FOR THAT 21 DAYS OF CREW SUPPORT. >> RIGHT. >> WHEN YOU’RE LOOKING AT A LONG DURATION AROUND THE MOON AND A HABITAT YOU PUT AT THE MOON FOR LONG DURATION, THAT HABITAT ABSOLUTELY NEEDS SOME CLOSED LOOP LIFE CONTROL. >> ABSOLUTELY, YES. SO THAT’S WHERE WE’LL PROBABLY SEE THE NEXT GENERATION OF CLOSED LOOP LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS, IS THAT. SO-- AND IT’S CLOSED LOOP BECAUSE WATER IS A PART OF IT, BUT THEN ALSO I KNOW ENVIRONMENT CONTROL, RIGHT, LIKE OXYGEN. THAT’S PART OF IT, TOO, RIGHT? >> RIGHT, SO OXYGEN, A LOT OF THAT-- ESPECIALLY LIKE, SAY, IF YOU’RE TRYING TO DO EVAs, YOU WANT TO SAVE THAT AIR. YOU DON’T WANT TO DUMP IT OVERBOARD WHEN YOU’RE DOING EVAs. SO THERE’S A LOT OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPROVED ON THE SPACE STATION AND CONTINUE TO BE IMPROVED IN A LUNAR ENVIRONMENT TO CONTINUE ENABLING LONGER-- EVEN MORE AND MORE AMBITIOUS SPACE EXPLORATION IN THE FUTURE. >> ABSOLUTELY. SO LET’S KIND OF GO BACK INSIDE THE ORION AND SEE AND KIND OF POINT OUT THE DIFFERENT FEATURES, WHAT’S COOL, WHAT’S UPGRADED, AND WHAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGIES ARE BEING BROUGHT TO THE TABLE. I KNOW YOU SAID THERE’S A LOT OF SPACE, BUT THE COMPUTERS ARE SMALLER, RIGHT? SO WHAT KIND OF COMPUTERS DO YOU HAVE ON ORION? >> SO WE’RE USING HONEYWELL COMPUTERS, AND I ACTUALLY THINK THEY’RE THE SAME TYPES USED ON BOEING 787 AIRCRAFT. >> OH, COOL. >> SO THESE ARE AVIONICS, HIGH TECHNOLOGY AVIONICS. >> YEAH. >> OR STATE OF THE ART, AND WE’RE RUNNING-- THERE’S FOUR COMPUTERS, AND THEY ACTUALLY ALL RUN IN PARALLEL BECAUSE IF ONE FAILS, YOU DON’T WANT THE SPACECRAFT TO GO, “I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO!” SO ALL FOUR OF THEM RUN IN PARALLEL, AND WE DO THAT FOR A LOT OF REASONS. NUMBER ONE, TIME CRITICAL THINGS. IF ONE GOES DOWN, YOU HAVE THREE OTHERS ALREADY WORKING, AND THEY’RE CHECKING EACH OTHER TO MAKE SURE IF ONE HAS AN INTERRUPT AND PRODUCES BAD DATA YOU DON’T USE IT. >> YEAH. >> SO ALL OF THEM ARE RUNNING IN PARALLEL ON THE SAME DATA AND CHECKING EACH OTHER TO MAKE SURE IT’S ALL RIGHT. >> COOL. >> AND THEN THERE’S OTHER THINGS. THERE’S LOTS OF RADIATION IN SPACE. >> OH, YEAH. >> COMPUTERS AND AVIONICS DON’T LIKE RADIATION. YOU CAN-- THEY GET HARDENED TO PROTECT THEM, BUT YOU CAN GET SINGLE EVENT UPSETS, WHICH BASICALLY CHANGES A BIT FROM A 0 TO A 1. WELL, YOU CHANGE A BIT FROM A 0 TO A 1 AND YOU GET A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ANSWER IN THE ALGORITHM. >> OH, NO! >> SO WE PUT FOUR ON THERE TO PROTECT FOR THE LIKELIHOOD OF TWO EVEN GETTING INTERRUPTS MID-AIR. BECAUSE YOU CAN GET ONE WITH AN INTERRUPT, AND THEN VERY SHORTLY AFTER, HAVE ANOTHER ONE. SO WE’VE DONE FOUR BECAUSE WE’VE DONE THE RISK CALCULATIONS AND WE THINK WITH FOUR WE’VE BROUGHT DOWN THAT RISK AS MUCH AS YOU CAN DO WITHOUT-- YOU KNOW, YOU CAN PUT 100 COMPUTERS ON THERE, BUT IT’S STILL TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE TO HAVE THEM ALL GO DOWN AT ONCE. >> YEAH. >> YOU CAN NEVER COMPLETELY GET RID OF THE RISK. >> DO YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF RADIATION PROTECTION TECHNOLOGY KIND OF BUILT INTO ORION? >> SO THE AVIONICS ARE CALLED RAD-HARD-- RADIATION-HARDENED-- TO PROTECT THEM. >> COOL. >> BUT THE IMPORTANT PART IS THE CREW. >> OBVIOUSLY, YEAH. >> SO MOST OF THE TIME THEY’RE GETTING BACKGROUND RADIATION. AND WHEN YOU’RE OUTSIDE THE MAGNETOSPHERE OF THE EARTH, THEY’RE GETTING MUCH HIGHER DOSES OF RADIATION. >> OKAY. >> SO A FEW WEEKS IN SPACE AT THE MOON IS EQUIVALENT TO SIX MONTHS ON THE ISS. SO YOU SEE A LOT OF BIG RADIATION DIFFERENCES BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY TRANSIT THE VAN ALLEN RADIATION BELT JUST TO GET TO THE MOON. >> RIGHT. >> BUT THEN YOU HAVE-- YOUR BIG WORRIES ARE SOLAR FLARES FROM THE SUN, WHICH SEND A HUGE AMOUNT OF RADIATION OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. SO IF THAT HAPPENS, THEY ACTUALLY HAVE SHELTER PROCEDURES IN PLACE WHERE THEY’LL EMPTY OUT THE LOCKER INSIDE ORION, THE CREW WILL GET DOWN IN THOSE LOCKERS AND PUT AS MUCH STUFF AROUND THEM AS YOU CAN-- SO ALL OF THEIR CLOTHES, THEIR BAGS OF WATER OR WHATEVER WILL GET PACKED AROUND THEM SO THAT YOU BASICALLY CREATE A LITTLE HABITAT, A LITTLE SHELTER IN THE MIDDLE OF ORION, BECAUSE THE MORE STUFF, THE MORE STRUCTURE YOU CAN PUT BETWEEN YOU AND THE OUTSIDE, THE LESS RADIATION WILL GET THROUGH IN THOSE EVENTS. >> RIGHT. >> SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE PROCEDURES. THEY HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT WORKS. THEY JUST RECENTLY DID THAT TESTING, ACTUALLY, IN BUILDING 9. >> OH, COOL. >> IN OUR MOCKUP, SO THAT’S ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW THE TESTING HAPPENS. SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY SHOVE THE CREW--  THEY HAD TO MAKE SURE YOU COULD FIT THE CREW AND THEY CAN BE SEMI COMFORTABLE FOR WHATEVER LENGTH OF TIME IS REQUIRED, AND HAVE THEIR COMPUTER TO KEEP WORKING, AND STUFF LIKE THAT, AND COMMAND THE VEHICLE IN THERE, AND STUFF LIKE THAT. SO WE HAVE TO PROTECT THE CREW, SO THAT’S ANOTHER THING WE CAN DO, IS LITERALLY JUST PUT THEM IN A LITTLE POCKET, THEY BUILD A LITTLE FORT AND HANG OUT WHILE THE SOLAR PARTICLE EVENT IS GOING ON. >> YEAH, SO HOW-- ABOUT THOSE EVENTS, OBVIOUSLY YOU’RE PLANNING FOR IT. IT’S PART OF YOUR MISSION, YOU JUST DID A TEST FOR IT. WHAT IS THE PROCEDURE FOR-- HOW LONG DO YOU HAVE FROM WHEN YOU DETECT IT TO WHEN YOU COMMUNICATE IT THE CREW AND THEY HAVE TO GET INTO THIS MODE? AND THEN, HOW LONG DO THE EVENTS LAST AND THEY HAVE TO STAY THERE? >> SO, I MEAN, THE GOOD OR THE BAD THING, RIGHT. SO WHEN THE SUN HAS A SOLAR PARTICLE EVENT, YOU SEE THE SOLAR FLARE, THE LIGHT, SO THAT TRAVELS AT LIGHT SPEED. SO IT’S SECONDS OR MINUTES FROM THE TIME THE EVENT HAPPENS ON THE SUN UNTIL WE SEE IT ON EARTH. >> YEAH. >> BUT THE ACTUAL PARTICLES TRAVEL MUCH SLOWER, SO YOU HAVE A DAY OR TWO BEFORE THE PARTICLES GET TO THE EARTH-MOON SYSTEM. >> OH, THAT’S A DECENT AMOUNT OF TIME. >> YEAH. SO YOU CAN SEE THIS HAPPEN, AND WE HAVE SATELLITES THAT ARE DETECTING THAT. SAME THING THEY USE FOR THE SPACE STATION TO DETECT WHEN SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING. >> YEAH. >> SO YOU SEE THE EVENT HAPPENING AND YOU HAVE A DAY OR TWO TO PREPARE THE CREW OR GET IN THEIR HABITAT AND STUFF, AND I THINK IT’S ABOUT A DAY LONG WHERE THESE PARTICLES CAN BE PASSING THROUGH. >> WOW! >> SO THAT’S THE TYPE OF-- YOU GET AN ADVANCE WARNING. >> YEAH. >> AND THEN YOU HAVE ABOUT A DAY THEY’RE GOING TO BE HANGING OUT IN THEIR LITTLE SHELTER UNTIL THE LEVELS HAVE DECREASED ENOUGH TO GET BACK OUT AGAIN. >> RIGHT. I WOULDN’T HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT. JUST IF YOU CAN DETECT IT IN A FEW MINUTES, THEN I WOULD THINK, “OH, MAN, THEY HAVE NO TIME TO PREPARE FOR THIS.” BUT I FEEL LIKE THAT’S A WAY BETTER SITUATION, AND ESPECIALLY YOU HAVE THE PROCEDURES TO KIND OF GO THROUGH THAT, TOO. >> YEAH, LUCKILY WE’RE FAR ENOUGH FROM THE SUN THAT WE HAVE THAT SORT OF ADVANCE WARNING TIME. >> YEAH. >> AND IT’S NOT AS HOT. >> DEFINITELY. SO WHEN I IMAGINE THE FUTURE OF SPACE TECHNOLOGY, I’M IMAGINING, LIKE, A FUTURISTIC, LIKE, “INTERSTELLAR,” OR SOMETHING KIND OF MOVIE WITH ALL KINDS OF FANCY TECHNOLOGIES. I KNOW TALKING WITH SOME FOLKS, TOUCHSCREENS WERE CONSIDERED, I GUESS, BUT THERE’S SOME CHALLENGES WITH TOUCHSCREENS. IS ORION USING SOMETHING LIKE THAT? OR IS THE CHALLENGES TOO MUCH AND THEY’RE USING SOMETHING ELSE? >> SO WE’RE NOT USING TOUCHSCREENS. >> OKAY. >> THAT WAS, I THINK, A TRADE EARLY ON IN THE DESIGN. THE TIME CREW HAD A LOT OF INPUT IN IT, BUT I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS NOT TO DO IT IS BECAUSE ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE’S A LOT OF DYNAMIC MOTION GOING ON, YOU’RE TRYING TO IN A-- YOU’RE SUITED, YOU’VE GOT A GLOVE ON, YOU’RE TRYING TO PUSH A BUTTON ON A SCREEN BUT YOUR HAND’S SHAKING BECAUSE THERE’S A LOT OF VIBRATION. SO I THINK THAT IS-- THAT WAS ONE OF THE LEADING FACTORS TO DECIDE NOT TO. >> RIGHT. >> SO WE’RE USING COMPUTER SCREENS AND THEY’VE GOT EDGE SWITCHES, SO THERE’S ACTUALLY PHYSICAL BUTTONS AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE SCREENS. >> YEAH. >> SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU CAN FIND IN AIRPLANE COCKPITS. >> OKAY. >> SO WE CAN CHANGE THE SOFTWARE, SO IT’LL PUT DATA BESIDE IT AND YOU CAN SAY SO FOR ONE SCREEN THE BUTTON MIGHT DO THIS, SO THEY HAVE COMMANDS THEY CAN INPUT WITH THOSE BUTTONS. BUT IT’S ACTUALLY A PHYSICAL BUTTON THEY PUSH. >> YEAH. >> SO THAT WAY YOU KNOW YOU’RE GETTING THE RIGHT INPUT. >> YEAH. >> VERSUS A SHAKY HAND TRYING TO HIT A TOUCHSCREEN BUTTON. >> YEAH, THAT’S AN ISSUE. >> SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES THAT WAS DECIDED EARLY. SO WE HAVE EDGE SWITCHES AND LITTLE SWIZZLES, SO LITTLE TOGGLES, SO THEY CAN MOVE THE CURSOR AROUND ON THE SCREEN. >> OH, WOW. >> SO IT’S A LITTLE BIT MORE TACTICAL FEEDBACK, SO ESPECIALLY IN A VIBRATING ENVIRONMENT THEY CAN CONTROL THE COMPUTER A LITTLE BIT MORE PRECISELY. >> HAVE YOU TESTED, LIKE, SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHERE YOU PUT THEM IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY’RE VIBRATING AS IF THEY WERE IN A LAUNCH OR SOME OTHER KIND OF EVENT DURING THE MISSION AND YOU NEED TO BE PRESSING BUTTONS AND CERTAIN CUES? >> I THINK THAT’S ACTUALLY BEEN DONE ALREADY. >> OH, OKAY. >> SO OUR MOCKUP IN BUILDING 9, THE SCREENS WORK. >> OH, COOL. >> SO THOSE ARE ALREADY WORKING, THEY CAN TEST OUT. THEY HAVE A WHOLE TEAM DOING THE DISPLAYS FOR THE CREW, SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT INFORMATION ON THE SCREEN. >> YEAH. >> ALL THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS AND THEN HAVE ALL THE COMMANDS IN A PROCEDURE FORMAT SO THEY CAN VERY-- >> RIGHT. >> WITHOUT HAVING TO THINK ABOUT IT, FOLLOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. BECAUSE IN AN EMERGENCY YOU DON’T HAVE TIME TO FLIP THROUGH A BUNCH OF SCREENS TO FIND THE BUTTON AND COMMANDS YOU WANT. >> GOT TO BE FAST, RIGHT? >> SO THEY’VE GOT IT ALL. THEY’VE GOT A WHOLE TEAM BUILDING THAT DISPLAYS. I THINK THEY’VE ACTUALLY PUT THE CREW ON A SHAKER TABLE. >> YEAH. >> AND MADE THEM DO THIS, BUT IF THEY HAVEN’T THEY WILL BE. >> YEAH. >> BUT YEAH, BUT MAKING SURE THAT THE CREW CAN EXECUTE THE PROCEDURES AND HAVE THE RIGHT DISPLAYS IN FRONT OF THEM TO KNOW WHAT TO DO IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE VEHICLE DESIGN. >> RIGHT. YEAH, YOU WOULDN’T BE THINKING ABOUT THAT IF YOU WEREN’T, LIKE, IF YOU WERE JUST LIKE, “OH, LET’S PUT TOUCHSCREENS ON ORION.” AND IT’S JUST LIKE, “NO, THERE’S A LOT OF CHALLENGES. THERE’S GOING TO BE VIBRATING, THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE BUTTONS WORK.” YEAH, THERE’S-- >> SO, I MEAN, THAT’S WHAT THE ENGINEERS DO IS HAVE TO THINK THROUGH ALL OF THE PROBLEMS, AND GET THE INPUT OF THE CREW, AND MAKE SURE WE’RE PUTTING THROUGH THE-- NOT THE BEST SOLUTIONS EVER, BUT AN ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION THAT MEETS ALL OF THE COMPUTING NEEDS, RIGHT? >> RIGHT. YEAH. >> TOUCHSCREENS MAYBE NICE IN SOME SITUATIONS, BUT IN OTHERS NOT SO MUCH. SO WHAT’S THE ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION THAT BALANCES ALL OF THOSE FACTORS? >> RIGHT. SO I KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO ORION, I MEAN, ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES JUST OF THE MISSION ITSELF IS THAT IT’S A FAIRLY LARGE SPACECRAFT, RIGHT? IT’S BIGGER THAN APOLLO AND IT’S GOING TO GO SO FAR OUT THAT WHEN IT COMES BACK TO EARTH IT’S GOING TO BE COMING IN PRETTY HOT, RIGHT? IT’S GOING TO BE COMING FAST. SO ONE OF THE BIG TECHNOLOGIES FOR THIS WHOLE THING IS A HEAT SHIELD, RIGHT? >> YEAH, SO WE’RE COMING IN-- WHEN YOU RETURN FROM THE EARTH-MOON SYSTEM-- IT’S NOT JUST ORION, IT’S ANY SPACECRAFT YOU SEND OUT TO THE MOON. >> OKAY. >> IT WILL COME BACK AND YOU’LL RE-ENTER, YOU'LL HIT ENTRY INTERFACE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HIT THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE EARTH. OR, NOT HIT, BUT GENTLY ENTER THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE EARTH. >> YES. >> YOU’RE GOING AROUND 25,000 MILES PER HOUR, WHICH IS 11 KILOMETERS PER SECOND. >> ALL RIGHT, PRETTY FAST. >> SO YOU’RE REALLY CRUISING. >> YEAH. >> AND SO, WHEN YOU DO THAT, IT’S ACTUALLY THE ATMOSPHERE’S HELPING YOU, BECAUSE WE’RE USING THE ATMOSPHERE TO SLOW DOWN. >> OKAY. >> SO WE USED THAT BLUNT CAPSULE SHAPE ARE AEROBRAKING. SO WE’RE LETTING THE AIR SLOW US DOWN, BUT IN DOING THAT IT’S CREATING HEAT. >> YEAH. >> SO ALL OF THAT FrICTION, BASICALLY, AND THE SHOCKWAVE OF THAT, YOU’RE TURNING THE AIR INTO PLASMA. >> OH. >> AND SO, THE PLASMA YOU’RE CREATING IS INCREDIBLY HOT. >> YEAH. >> SO OUR HEAT SHIELD CAN GET UP TO AROUND 5,000 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. >> OH, MAN. >> SO WE’RE TALKING A LOT OF HEAT. SO ON ORION, WE’RE USING AVCOAT, WHICH IS THE SAME THE MATERIAL APOLLO USED. SO AGAIN, THERE’S ANOTHER SIMILARITY. >> COOL. >> BUT THAT’S LIKE REALLY THE ONLY USE FOR AVCOAT. SO AFTER APOLLO, THEY DIDN’T MANUFACTURE IT AND A COMPANY CALLED TEXTRON MAKES IT. >> YEAH. >> SO THEY HAD TO GO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT AGAIN FOR ORION. SO WE’RE USING AN AVCOAT HEAT SHIELD LIKE APOLLO. ONE OF THE MODS-- OR MODIFICATIONS WE’VE DONE FOR EXPLORATION MISSION 1 IS WE’RE ACTUALLY USING A BLOCK APPLICATION SYSTEM. SO IT’S LIKE BIG BRICKS OF A HEAT SHIELD THAT HAVE BEEN PATCHED TOGETHER VERSUS WHAT’S CALLED A MONOLITH WHERE YOU MAKE IT ALL OUT OF ONE PIECE. >> YEAH. >> AND WE HAD REASONS FOR DOING THAT, THERMAL STRESSES AND STUFF LIKE THAT. BUT THAT’S ONE OF THE BIG THINGS WE’RE TESTING OUT ON EXPLORATION MISSION 1 IS THE NEW DESIGN THE HEAT SHIELD, WHICH IS A BLOCK SYSTEM. SO IF YOU LOOK AT IT IT LOOKS LIKE A BUNCH OF BRICKS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT TOGETHER ON OUR HEAT SHIELD. >> YEAH, INSTEAD OF ONE SOLID PIECE. >> RIGHT. >> IS IT KIND OF THE SAME LOGIC AS THE SHUTTLE? BECAUSE SHUTTLE ALSO HAD THE LITTLE-- IS IT TILES OR BLOCKS? >> YEAH. >> THE WHOLE CONCEPT WAS IF ONE OF THEM’S NOT GOOD YOU JUST TAKE IT OFF AND POP IN ANOTHER ONE. IS THAT RIGHT? >> SO WE DON’T REUSE OURS. >> OH, OKAY. >> THE CONCEPT OF THE BLOCKS IS BECAUSE WHEN IT GETS COLD IN SPACE IT ACTUALLY CREATES A STRESS AND COULD CRACK IT. >> OH. >> SO ONE OF THE REASONS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO THE BLOCK IS SO THAT WE ARE MORE SAFE AFTER IT'S BEEN EXPOSED IN SPACE, THAT WE DON’T DEVELOPE CRACKS THAT WEREN’T THERE BEFORE WE LAUNCHED. >> RIGHT. >> SO THAT’S ONE OF THE REASONS WE WENT TO THE BLOCK. YOU MENTIONED THE SHUTTLE TILE-- SO WE ACTUALLY USED THE SAME THING AS THE SHUTTLE. >> OH, COOL. >> SO THE SHUTTLE HAD TILES ON ITS BELLY. >> YEAH. >> BUT THOSE CAN ONLY GET UP TO AROUND 2,000 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. >> OH, YEAH. >> SO WE’RE USING THOSE ON THE BACK SHELL, SO THE CONIC PART OF THE VEHICLE IS COVERED IN THE SAME TILES LIKE THE SPACE SHUTTLE WERE. >> OH, WOW. >> AND THEN WE’VE GOT A TAPE OVER THEM SO YOU WON’T REALLY SEE THEM. >> YEAH. >> BUT YEAH, SO WE’RE USING THE SAME TILE MATERIAL, CERAMIC TILES THAT THE SHUTTLE HAD ON THE BACK SHELL, BUT IT'S NOT-- THEY’RE NOT ENOUGH HEAT REJECTION OR HEAT PROTECTION TO USE ON THE HEAT SHIELD, SO WE HAVE TO USE THE AVCOAT ON THE HEAT SHIELD LIKE APOLLO DID. >> YEAH, BECAUSE THERE’S THAT MUCH OF A TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE, RIGHT? LIKE, THAT’S GOING TO-- YOU’RE-- LIKE, YOU SAID, THE BRUNT FORCE, SO THAT’S LIKE-- THAT’S YOUR 5,000 DEGREES. BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU DON’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. >> YEAH, SO THEY’RE BASICALLY LIKE-- THE BACK SHELL IS IN THE LEEWARD SIDE. >> YEAH. >> SO IT’S PROTECTED. THE HEAT’S SORT OF GOING AROUND IT, SO IT DOESN’T SEE-- GET NEARLY AS HOT AS THE HEAT SHIELD DOES. >> WOW. >> BUT THEY ARE A LOT LIGHTER. SO ONCE AGAIN, THE REASON YOU USE THE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS IS BECAUSE WE’RE TRYING TO SAVE MASS. >> YES. >> SO ON THE BACK SHELL WE CAN USE THE TILES. THE CERAMIC TILES ARE SUPER LIGHT. IT’S KIND OF AMAZING HOW LIGHT THOSE THINGS ARE. >> YEAH. >> SO WE COVER THE BACK SHELL IN THOSE, BUT WE HAVE-- AVCOAT’S A LOT HEAVIER SO WE USE THAT ON THE HEAT SHIELD. >> OH, OKAY. >> BUT THE HEAT SHIELD ITSELF IS ONLY ABOUT TWO INCHES THICK. SO WE’RE DOING A LOT IN TWO INCHES ON THAT AVCOAT. >> YEAH, THAT IS SOME STRONG STUFF FOR TWO INCHES. >> YEAH. >> YEAH, YOU’RE NOT-- NO LAYER’S PEELING AWAY THERE, RIGHT, BECAUSE-- >> ACTUALLY, IT DOES. >> REALLY? >> AVCOAT IS ABLATIVE, SO THE WAY YOU REJECT THE HEAT IS IT BURNS AWAY AS YOU’RE RE-ENTERING. >> WHOA! >> SO WE’RE GOING TO LOSE ABOUT HALF AN INCH WORTH OF AVCOAT. AS YOU RE-RENTER, YOU HAVE TO HAVE ENOUGH THERE THAT WE’VE PROTECTED FOR HOW MUCH COULD BURN AWAY AND STILL HAVE PROTECTION AND THINGS LIKE THAT. >> YEAH. >> BUT THE AVCOAT DOES GET THINNER AS YOU’RE COMING IN THROUGH ENTRY. >> YEAH. IS IT SORT OF A ONE AND DONE KIND OF TECHNOLOGY THEN? IT IS LIKE YOU USE THE HEAT SHIELD AND THEN, “OKAY, THAT’S GOOD FOR THAT MISSION. TAKE IT OFF AND PUT ON A NEW HEAT SHIELD.” >> YEAH, THE HEAT SHIELD ABSOLUTELY IS NOT REUSEABLE. >> YEAH. >> SO WE’RE NOT GOING TO TRY TO REUSE THAT, ESPECIALLY NOW YOU’VE DUNKED IT IN THE OCEAN. >> YEAH. >> SO A LOT OF THINGS DON’T LIKE SALT WATER. >> YEAH. >> SO YOU WON’T WANT TO REUSE THE HEAT SHIELD. >> RIGHT. >> IT HAD ITS DAY, AND YOU BUILD A NEW ONE. >> RIGHT, AND IT’S BEEN THROUGH SOME STUFF SO LET IT-- JUST LET IT GO. PUT ON A NEW ONE AND WE’LL DEAL WITH IT LATER. THERE’S A LOT OF OTHER GOOD TECHNOLOGIES ON THERE, TOO. I MEAN, IS THERE ANYTHING-- LIKE, EVEN THE SEATS THAT YOU’RE REVISITING, OR ARE YOU DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT THERE? >> SO THE SEATS ARE A NEW DESIGN. >> OH. >> APOLLO USED ACTUALLY THESE SORT OF CANVAS BEDS TO SAVE MASS. WE’RE USING ALUMINUM STRUCTURE. >> OH, OKAY. >> THINNED OUT AND STUFF, BUT THEY’RE ADJUSTABLE FOR DIFFERENT SIZE PEOPLE. >> COOL. >> RIGHT. SO YOU CAN FIT ALL THE WAY FROM LIKE A 5th PERCENTILE WOMAN TO A 95th PERCENTILE MALE. >> ALL RIGHT. >> SO YOU CAN FIT QUITE THE RANGE OF PEOPLE INSIDE THE VEHICLE. >> YEAH. >> AND SO, BUT THE SEATS ARE ALUMINUM FOR LAUNCH. THEY’VE GOT LEG RESTS AND STUFF. THE CREW-- LIKE, EVERYTHING YOU LAUNCH ON YOUR BACK SO YOU’RE TAKING THE G-FORCES IN THE CHEST ON ASCENT. BUT THEN, YOU CAN MOVE THE LEG PANELS AND STUFF LIKE THAT AFTER YOU GET ON ORBIT TO GIVE YOURSELF MORE ROOM SO YOU DON’T HAVE THESE FOOT PANELS STICKING UP IN SPACE. SO YEAH, SO THE SEATS ARE A NEW DESIGN. >> COOL. >> THERE’S NOTHING REVOLUTIONARY ABOUT THEM. >> THEY’RE JUST-- I MEAN, IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE IT’S BUILT TO BE FLEXIBLE FOR DIFFERENT SIZES AND TO BE AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE. >> YEAH. >> SO WHEN YOU’RE LAUNCHING AND YOU’RE HAVING A LOT OF G-FORCES ON YOUR CHEST AT LEAST YOU’RE GOING TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE PRETTY MUCH. >> RIGHT. >> YOU’RE NOT GOING TO BE TOSSING AND TURNING ALL OVER THE PLACE. SO THEY’RE GOING TO BE-- ARE THEY GOING TO BE WEARING THE-- WHAT’S THE SUIT THEY’RE GOING TO BE WEARING? IS IT KIND OF LIKE AN ORANGE PUMPKIN SUIT THAT THEY USED TO HAVE ON SHUTTLE? >> IT IS KIND OF LIKE THE ORANGE PUMPKIN SUIT. >> ALL RIGHT, COOL. >> I MEAN, I THINK THE ACRONYM IS MACES. >> MACES. >> DON’T ASK ME WHAT THEY STAND FOR. IT’S AN UPGRADE FROM WHAT THEY HAD ON SHUTTLE. >> COOL. >> BUT IT IS VERY SIMILAR, SO THEY’LL BE IN THE ORANGE LITTLE PUMPKIN SUITS FOR ASCENT AND ENTRY. >> RIGHT. >> WITH GLOVES AND HELMETS, SO IF SOMETHING HAPPENS-- BECAUSE WE CAN ABORT AT ANY TIME DURING ASCENT AND YOU LAND IN THE OCEAN. SO ON ASCENT, YOU LAND IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. AND WHEN WE RE-ENTER WE LAND IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN. SO THE SUITS ARE THERE FOR THEIR PROTECTION. >> YEAH. >> ESPECIALLY AFTER THEY LAND. SO IF THEY HAD, SAY SOMETHING HAPPENED AND THEY HAD TO GET OUT OF THE CABIN, YOU’VE GOT THAT FULL SURVIVAL SUIT THING. >> RIGHT. >> WITH THE BUILT-IN-- I THINK IT’S GOT THE INFLATABLE RAFTS, LIKE A LIFE VEST IN IT, STUFF LIKE THAT. >> YEAH. >> SO YEAH, SO THE SUITS ARE FOR THEIR PROTECTION IN CASE ANYTHING GOES WRONG. >> THEY HAVE A BUNCH OF SUPPLIES JUST TO KEEP KIND OF SURVIVE FOR A LITTLE BIT JUST IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENS, I KNOW, YEAH. >> YEAH, THE LIKE SIGNAL FLASHING LIGHTS FOR RESCUE CREWS TO SEEN THEM. >> RIGHT. YEAH, A LOT OF IT’S LIKE EMERGENCY STUFF. COOL, YEAH, UPGRADED PUMPKIN SUITS. AND THEY-- IT’S A LONG MISSION, RIGHT? YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT 20-SOMETHING DAYS, SO THEY GET TO TAKE IT OFF AFTER LAUNCH AND I GUESS BEFORE RE-ENTRY THEY DON’T HAVE IT ON, RIGHT? THEY TAKE-- >> THEY PUT IT BACK ON FOR RE-ENTRY. >> RIGHT, THEY PUT IT BACK ON, BUT THEY-- I MEAN, DURING THAT WHOLE TIME THEY DON’T HAVE IT ON. >> YEAH, SO THEY’LL PUT THE SUITS ON FOR ASCENT, AND THEN AFTER WE’VE DONE TLI, THE TRANS-LUNAR INJECTION BURN, THEY’LL BE ABLE TO TAKE THEM OFF. >> OH. >> AND ONCE THEY GET TO ORBIT THEY CAN TAKE THE HELMET AND GLOVES OFF, BECAUSE ONCE YOU’VE SHOWN THAT THE CABIN ISN’T LEAKING AIR THEY CAN MAKE THEMSELVES A LITTLE BIT MORE COMFORTABLE. >> RIGHT. >> BUT THERE’S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF TIME UNTIL THE TLI BURN, SO THEY’LL PROBABLY STILL BE IN THEIR SUITS WHILE WE ACTUALLY DO THE BURN. >> YEAH. >> AND THEN ONCE WE’VE DONE THAT THEY’LL HAVE TIME TO ACTUALLY GET OUT OF THE SUIT, WHICH TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO WRESTLE YOUR WAY OUT OF. >> OF COURSE. YEAH, AND-- >> BUT THEN FOR THE MOST PART, THEY’LL JUST STOW THEM AND THEY WON’T GET THEM BACK OUT UNLESS THERE’S A LEAK OR WE’RE BACK TO RE-ENTRY AND THEY’LL PUT THEM ON FOR RE-ENTRY. >> HOW ABOUT THAT. tHAT’S ALL YOU REALLY NEED IT FOR, RIGHT? LAUNCH AND ENTRY, SO-- YEAH, LAUNCH AND REENTRY, I GUESS. SO YEAH, YOU’RE GOOD. >. YEAH, SO WE HAVE A SHIRT SLEEVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE CABIN, SO THEY’LL GET TO WEAR YOUR NASA POLO SHIRT AND PANTS, JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER CREW. >> VERY COOL. YEAH. I KNOW-- I THINK IT’S THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION IS AT 72 DEGREES I THINK IS WHAT THEY TRY TO KEEP IT AT? I’M GUESSING WILL ORION KIND OF BE THE SAME? >> YEAH, WE’LL BE ABOUT THE SAME. >> YEAH. >> AND THEN, WE HAVE FANS AND STUFF TO KEEP THEM COOL. WHEN THEY’RE DOING EXERCISES WE’LL FLIP ON AN EXTRA FAN TO MAKE SURE WE’RE CIRCULATING THAT AIR BETTER. >> COOL, YEAH. >> AND STUFF LIEK THAT. >> MAYBE SOME AIR FRESHENERS, TOO? >> DON’T HAVE ANY AIR FRESHENERS SO THAT’S GOING TO BE-- YOU GET USED TO YOUR OWN SMELL THOUGH, RIGHT? >> OH, YEAH. OH, WOW. OKAY, SO THAT’S PRETTY GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE INSIDE OF ORION. AND WHEN WE FIRST STARTED, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF THE TESTS THAT THEY WERE GOING ON AND WE HAVE DIFFERENT ARTICLES FOR ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT TEST. JUST ONE OF THE BIG ONES THAT I THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IS ONE THAT WE’VE ALREADY DONE AND THAT’S EFT-1, RIGHT? SO WHAT WAS THE MISSION ALL ABOUT? >> YEAH, SO EFT-1, WHICH I GOT TO BE A PART OF AND IT WAS AWESOME. >> YEAH. >> SO TECHNICALLY, WE MENTIONED EXPLORATION MISSION 1 EARLIER AND TALKED ABOUT THAT BEING OUR FIRST BIG IN SPACE TEST, BUT IT’S ACTUALLY OUR SECOND. SO EXPLORATION FLIGHT TEST 1 WAS THE FIRST TEST WE DID IN DECEMBER OF 2014, AND THAT ONE WAS A TEST FOR THE CREW MODULE AND RE-ENTRY AND THE PARACHUTE SYSTEMS. SO WE ACTUALLY LAUNCHED THE CREW MODULE, WHICH WAS MOSTLY COMPLETE AND JUST A STRUCTURAL SERVICE MODULE, AND IT LAUNCHED ON A DELTA IV HEAVY. SO IT’S A COMMERCIAL ROCKET. WE CAN JUST PUT IT ON THERE TO TEST IT OUT. AND IT FLEW UP-- WE DID ONE ORBIT IN LOW EARTH ORBIT, AND THEN WE USED THE DELTA IV HEAVY UP FIRST STAGE TO TAKE US AS HIGH AS IT POSSIBLY COULD. WE USED THE PERFORMANCE THAT ROCKET HAD. SO WE ACTUALLY ONLY GOT UP TO 3,600 MILES IN ALTITUDE. BUT WHAT THAT DID IS WE WERE ABLE TO COME BACK DOWN AT 20,000 MILES PER HOUR, SO WE GOT AS FAST AN ENTRY AS WE COULD AND THAT WAS TO TEST THE HEAT SHIELD. >> YEAH. >> BECAUSE WE’VE DONE A LOT OF ANALYSIS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT UNTIL YOU CAN ACTUALLY TEST AND VALIDATE THAT YOUR MODELS WERE RIGHT YOU’RE GUESSING. >> YES. >> TO SOME EXTENT. >> RIGHT. >> AND THEN WE DID A FULL PARACHUTE TEST ON THAT, TOO. SO BASICALLY WE WERE ABLE TO TEST THE ASCENT FEATURES. >> MM-HMM. >> WE BUILT THE CREW MODULE FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND YOU LEARN A LOT JUST BY DOING IT. >> YEAH. >> SO BUILDING THAT THE FIRST TIME WAS A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED ON HOW TO MAKE IT ACTUALLY BETTER. AND THEN, WE TESTED THE FULL ENTRY SEQUENCE, SO THAT MEANS THE FORWARD BAY COVER. WE HAVE 11 PARACHUTES, SO THE FORWARD BAY COVER CAME OFF. WE HAD DROGUES. WE HAD THE MAIN PARACHUTES IN TOUCH DOWN IN THE RECOVERY TEAM. SO EFT-1 WAS OUR FIRST IN SPACE FLIGHT TEST OF THE CREW MODULE AND IT WAS PRETTY AWESOME. >> YEAH. >> IT WORKED LIKE ALMOST COMPLETELY ACCORDING TO PLAN. THERE WAS ONLY LIKE ONE EVEN MINOR ANOMALY. >> HUH. >> SO WE WERE REALLY HAPPY WITH THE DATA WE GOT BACK ON THAT AND WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS IN DESIGN AS A RESULT. >> WOW. ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE LESSONS THAT YOU LEARNED? I MEAN, YOU TALK ABOUT THE HEAT SHIELD, AND PARACHUTES, AND YOU SAID LAUNCHING AND THAT WHOLE SEQUENCE, TOO. SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU LEARNED? >> SO ONE OF THE REALLY COOL ONES WAS-- SO IN BUILDING IT WE ORIGINALLY HAD LIKE 35 METAL PARTS THAT MADE UP THE PRESSURE VESSEL, OR 35 WELDS AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF PIECES THAT HAD TO ALL GO TOGETHER. AND BETWEEN THE EFT-1 AND THE EM-1 CREW MODULE WE HAVE ONLY 7 WELDS THAT’S DONE. >> WHOA. >> SO DECREASING THE NUMBER OF WELDS SAVES A LOT OF MASS. SO IT WAS LIKE A COUPLE HUNDRED POUNDS OF MASS SAVED BECAUSE YOU’RE DOING FEWER WELDS AND MAKING BIGGER PARTS WITH FEWER SEAMS. >> OH. >> SO THOSE KINDS OF PRODUCTION THINGS HELP TEACH YOU A LOT. >> YEAH. >> AND THEN, WE WERE ABLE TO LEARN A LOT, LIKE THE WAY SOME OF THE SYSTEMS WORKED, LIKE THE CREW MODULE COOLING SYSTEM. WE SAW SOME REALLY INTERESTING DATA AND SO THEY WERE ABLE TO UPDATE THEIR MODELS WITH THAT. THE PARACHUTES, LEARNED A LOT. >> YEAH. >> BECAUSE THAT WAS THE FIRST END TO END FLIGHT TEST. THEY DO A LOT OF DROP TESTS, BUT YOU CAN ONLY GET CERTAIN CONDITIONS ON THOSE FLIGHTS AND STUFF. >> RIGHT. >> THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME IT WAS END TO END. SO THE MODELS COULD ALL BE UPDATED AND WE KNOW MORE. SO A LOT OF TIMES WHEN WE’RE DOING THESE TESTS IS YOU’RE VALIDATING THE MODELS, AND THEN YOU CAN REDUCE THE UNCERTAINTIES THAT YOU HAD TO APPLY. >> MM-HMM. >> SO THINGS LIKE THE HEAT SHIELD CAN MAYBE GET THINNER BECAUSE-- AND WE COULD SAVE SOME MASS, BECAUSE NOW WE KNOW MORE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT SO YOU CAN SHAVE OFF SOME OF THE UNCERTAINTIES AND WE CAN SAVE A LITTLE BIT OF MASS. SO THERE’S-- THOSE KIND OF IMPROVEMENTS ARE WHAT WE LEARNED OUT OF THE FLIGHT TEST. >> WOW. IS THAT WHERE YOU SAID IT WAS THE HEAT SHIELD IS NOW TWO INCHES. WAS IT TWO INCHES ON THAT FLIGHT? OR DID YOU LEARN THAT YOU CAN SHAVE IT OFF AND NOW IT’S TWO INCHES? >> SO NOW IT’S TWO INCHES. I THINK IT WAS ABOUT THE SAME ON THAT FLIGHT BECAUSE WE WEREN’T COMING IN QUITE AS FAST. >> OKAY. RIGHT, RIGHT. >> BUT THAT’S WHERE WE COULD UPDATE THE MODELS AND REDUCE SOME OF THE UNCERTAINTIES IN WHAT WE’RE DOING. >> RIGHT. >> SO IT HELPS YOU IN FUTURE DESIGNS. >> RIGHT, AND YOU SAVE A LOT OF MASS THAT WAY. >> YES. >> THAT’S PRETTY AWESOME. I CAN’T BELIEVE THERE’S 11 PARACHUTES, AND THEY COME OUT IN-- IT’S NOT LIKE YOU’RE FALLING THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE AND THEN-- BOOM! ELEVEN-- >> IT’S NOT JUST LIKE THE “UP” BALLOON HOUSE WHERE THEY ALL COME OUT AT ONCE. NO. >> RIGHT. >> UH-UH, NO. IT’S A BIG SEQUENCE. SO FOR THE FIRST-- >> YEAH. >> THE FIRST THREE PARACHUTES ARE VERY SMALL, AND THEY’RE WHAT ACTUALLY PULL THE FORWARD BAY COVER OFF. >> HMM. >> SO WHEN WE LAUNCH, YOU’VE GOT A BIG COMPOSITE FORWARD BAY COVER THAT’S PROTECTING ALL THOSE PARACHUTES FROM SPACE, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY DON’T GET TOO HOT OR TOO COLD AND THEY’RE STILL THERE WHEN YOU COME HOME AGAIN. >> VERY IMPORTANT. >> SO THE FIRST THREE REALLY PULL THAT FORWARD BAY COVER AWAY. >> OKAY. >> AND THEN, YOU PUT OUT TWO DROGUES AND THE DROGUES ARE USED WHEN WE ARE STILL GOING REALLY FAST. WE COME OUT AT 24,000 FEET OF ALTITUDE OVER THE OCEAN SO WE WAIT UNTIL WE’RE DOWN. WE SLOWED DOWN AS MUCH AS WE CAN IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND YOU ACTUALLY START THIS SEQUENCE AT 24,000 FEET. SO THE FORWARD BAY COVER COMES OFF. >> YEAH. >> THE TWO DROGUES COME OUT WHICH ARE SMALLER AND YOU’RE USING THEM TO SORT OF STABILIZE AND SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE. >> RIGHT. >> AND THOSE ARE FIRED WITH MORTARS, SO IT’S BASICALLY LIKE A CANNON. >> COOL. >> THAT BLOWS OUT, GOES BOOM, AND THERE THEY GO. AND THEN WHEN YOU’VE SLOWED DOWN ENOUGH FROM THOSE, WE ACTUALLY CUT THEM LOOSE, AND YOU THROW OUT THREE PILOTS. SO THE PILOTS ARE ACTUALLY REALLY SMALL PARACHUTES, BUT THEY’RE PULLING OUT THESE HUGE MAIN PARACHUTES. THE BIG ORANGE AND WHITE PARACHUTES YOU’RE USED TO SEEING ARE ACTUALLY PULLED OUT BY THREE SMALL PARACHUTES THEMSELVES, AND THEN THE BAGS COME OFF AND THE BIG PARACHUTES COME OUT, AND YOU HAVE YOUR THREE MAIN PARACHUTES, THE ORANGE AND WHITE ONES WE LAND ON SAFELY. >> YEAH. >> AND THOSE EVEN HAVE STAGES, BECAUSE IF YOU OPEN THEM UP ALL AT ONCE, THE FORCES WOULD TEAR THE PARACHUTE APART. >> RIGHT. >> SO THEY’VE ACTUALLY GOT KEVLAR RINGS IN THEM, AND SO THEY OPEN UP ONLY SO MUCH, AND THEN WHEN YOU’VE GOT ENOUGH FORCE, PYRO POPS THOSE RINGS AND IT GETS ONE STAGE BIGGER. AND THEN ANOTHER ONE, AND THEN THEY GET FULLY OPEN. SO YOU’RE STILL GOING FAST ENOUGH THAT YOU’VE GOT TO STAGE THAT PARACHUTE SO THAT YOU DON’T TEAR IT APART WHILE YOU’RE LANDING. SO WHEN YOU FINALLY GET THEM OUT, THEY CAN ACTUALLY COVER A FOOTBALL FIELD, THE THREE BIG PARACHUTES THAT YOU’VE GOT. >> WOW. BUT YOU’RE RIGHT-- I MEAN, YOU’RE GOING SO FAST THAT YOU DON’T WANT TO DEPLOY THOSE FIRST THING BECAUSE YOU’RE RIGHT, THEY’LL JUST TEAR APART. >> RIGHT. >> SO YOU’VE GOT THE ATMOSPHERE. THAT’S YOUR FIRST SORT OF QUOTE UNQUOTE “PARACHUTE” BECAUSE IT SLOWS YOU DOWN. AND THEN THE NEXT PARACHUTES BRING OUT-- JUST OPEN IT UP SO THAT MORE PARACHUTES CAN COME OUT. I JUST LOVE HOW THERE’S PARACHUTES TO BRING OUT PARACHUTES. >> I KNOW, THAT’S THE BEST PART. >> THAT WAS MY FAVORITE. >> SO YEAH, THE DROGUES ARE SMALL ENOUGH THAT THEY CAN BE FIRED WITH THE PYRO TAR, THE MORTAR, BUT THE BIG PARACHUTES, THEY ACTUALLY USE AN AUTOCLAVE TO ACTUALLY COMPRESS THEM DOWN, AND BUT THEN THEY’RE STILL THESE HUGE BRICKS, BASICALLY, OF PARACHUTE MATERIAL. AND I MEAN, THIS IS NYLON, SO IT’S REALLY LIGHTWEIGHT, BUT WHEN YOU’VE GOT SO MUCH OF IT, THEY END UP WITH THIS HEAVY MASS. AND YOU CAN’T-- THERE’S NO AMOUNT OF-- I MEAN, WE DON’T HAVE A GIANT CANNON. SO THOSE HAVE THEIR OWN PARACHUTE JUST TO PULL OUT THE MAIN PARACHUTES. >> THAT PROBABLY-- I MEAN, JUST THE PARACHUTE SYSTEM IN GENERAL, THAT’S GOT TO BE A DECENT AMOUNT OF WEIGHT FOR COMING UP AND GOING DOWN, TOO. SO THAT TAKES OUT A BIG CHUNK OF WHAT YOU CAN USE, RIGHT? >> RIGHT, SO ALL THESE SYSTEMS-- AND THOSE WE HAVE TO TAKE TO THE MOON AND BACK. SO EVERY TIME YOU TAKE IT SOMEPLACE NEW, THAT’S MASS YOU HAVE TO PUSH AROUND SPACE. >> YEAH. >> AND THAT TAKES MORE PROP AND MORE WEIGHT. SO THE AMOUNT-- I MEAN, OUR MOST CRITICAL MASS ITEM IS THE CREW MODULE BECAUSE THAT’S ALL THE MASS WE HAVE TO LAND UNDER THOSE PARACHUTES. SO IF THE CREW MODULE GOT SUPER HEAVY, THEN YOU’D NEED EVEN BIGGER PARACHUTES. SO WE HAVE TO CONTROL VERY TIGHTLY HOW MUCH MASS WE PUT ON EVERYWHERE. >> YEAH, WOW. OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT’S JUST-- I MEAN, IT’S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, RIGHT? I MEAN, WHAT’S THE BENEFIT OF USING PARACHUTES VERSUS JUST LIKE WHAT YOU SEE IN THE MOVIES-- LIKE JUST A PROPULSION SYSTEM THAT FIRES JETS AND LETS YOU LAND ON THE GROUND, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? >> THAT WOULD BE AWESOME, BUT WE DON’T HAVE-- YOU’D NEED A HUGE ROCKET, RIGHT? YOU NEEDED A HUGE ROCKET TO GET OFF THE GROUND, AND YOU’D THEN NEED A HUGE ROCKET TO SLOW DOWN AND DO SOME SORT OF PROPULSIVE REENTRY. THE SHUTTLE DID IT WITH-- THEY DID AERODYNAMIC REENTRY WHERE THE ATMOSPHERE SLOWED YOU DOWN, AND THEN THEY HAD THE LIFTING BODY SO THEY COULD ACTUALLY CONTROL THEIR FLIGHT AND LAND ON A RUNWAY. >> I LIKE HOW YOU SAY LIFTING BODY AND NOT WINGS. [ LAUGHTER ] >> THOSE ARE STUBBY WINGS. THEY DON’T QUITE WORK SUPER WELL, RIGHT? >> YEAH, JUST FROM TALKING TO ASTRONAUT PILOTS THAT ACTUALLY FLEW THE SHUTTLE, THEY SAID IT WAS LIKE FLYING A BRICK. YOU REALLY DIDN’T FLY-- IT WAS LIKE BARELY A GLIDE. >> IT’S LIKE A GRACEFUL CRASH. >> A GRACEFUL CRASH! BUT IT LANDS ON A HUGE RUNWAY AND STUFF LIKE THAT, TOO. SO YEAH. WHAT-- OH, GO AHEAD. >> AND THE REASON WE DON’T PUT WINGS ON ORION IS THAT’S SO MUCH MASS WE’D HAVE TO THEN TAKE TO THE MOON. SO THE WINGS, THE LIFTING BODY, TO TRY AND SEND THAT TO THE MOON IS HEAVIER THAN THE PARACHUTES WE’RE USING TO LAND WITH. >> AH. >> SO THAT’S ANOTHER TRADE YOU HAVE TO MAKE. IF YOU WANT TO SEND A LIFTING BODY, WELL, NOW I NEED  AN EVEN BIGGER ROCKET JUST TO GET IT THERE. SO YOU KEEP TRIMMING THINGS OFF, AND PARACHUTES WEIGH LESS THAN WINGS. >> HUH, THERE YOU GO, OKAY. SO OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A LOGIC TO IT, IT’S JUST-- AS COOL AS IT WOULD BE TO JUST LAND LIKE A “STAR WARS” SHIP OR SOMETHING, THERE’S-- WE’RE NOT THERE YET. >> YEAH. WELL, AND THE SOYUZ DOES USE A RETRO ROCKET. IT’S JUST BECAUSE THEY LAND ON LAND, AND THEY HAVE A ROCKET STRAPPED TO THE BOTTOM OF THEIR HEAT SHIELD. AND AT THE LAST MINUTE, IT TAKES OFF THAT LAST BIT OF SPEED SO YOU CAN LAND ON THE EARTH WITHOUT HURTING THE CREW. >> RIGHT. >> SINCE WE’RE LANDING IN THE OCEAN-- IT’S A DESIGN CHOICE THAT’S BEEN MADE, RIGHT-- WE DON’T NEED THE RETRO ROCKET. SO WE CAN LAND A LITTLE BIT FASTER-- WE’RE STILL ONLY GOING 20 MILES AN HOUR. SO WE WENT FROM 25,000 MILES AN HOUR TO 20 MILES PER HOUR IN 20 MINUTES. AND SO THEN WE SPLASHDOWN IN THE OCEAN, SO WE DON’T NEED THE RETRO ROCKET LIKE THE SOYUZ HAS. >> OKAY, SO THE DESIGN CHOICE OF THE OCEAN IS YOU CAN LAND FASTER, AND YOU DON’T NEED THE RETRO ROCKETS. >> RIGHT. >> YEAH, SO. >> AND THEN THE OTHER PART IS-- WELL, I MEAN, WE DON’T NECESSARILY IN THE U.S. HAVE A GOOD LAND LANDING SITE WHERE YOU WOULDN’T BE OVERFLYING CITIES, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. >> RIGHT. BUT YOU DON’T WANT TO LAND IN DEATH VALLEY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. >> RIGHT, AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS-- AND I SAY IF YOU TRIED TO LAND IN THE DESERT, ONE OF OUR ISSUES IS THAT IF THERE’S A ROCK AND YOU LAND ON TOP OF A ROCK, YOU COULD ACTUALLY INJURE THE CREW BECAUSE IT DOESN’T LAND THE SAME WAY IF YOU CAME DOWN ON TOP OF A BIG ROCK AS IT DID IF YOU CAME DOWN ON A NICE GRASSY PLANE. >> YEAH. >> SO THOSE ARE A LOT OF THE REASONS THAT WE WENT BACK TO LANDING IN WATER LIKE APOLLO DID. >> OH, OKAY. WELL, IT MAKES SENSE. SO JUST KIND OF THINKING ABOUT THE MISSION OF ORION-- AND I KNOW THERE’S LIKE A LOT OF DIFFERENT TESTS THAT WE CAN GO OVER, BUT WE’LL HAVE TO DO ANOTHER EPISODE FOR EM-1 AND LIKE ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF, BECAUSE THAT-- WE CAN REALLY DO JUST A WHOLE OTHER EPISODE JUST ON-- >> OH, WE CAN TALK ABOUT HOW EM-1 GOES TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME. >> OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. BUT YOU KNOW, KIND OF JUST ENDING ON THE IDEA OF THE MISSION, LIKE WHAT IS THE END GOAL? OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE 21 DAY MISSIONS, BUT YOU HINTED AT A GATEWAY, A DEEP SPACE GATEWAY. SO HOW DOES THAT FIT INTO THE ORION PICTURE? >> RIGHT, SO THE BIG PURPOSE OF ORION IS TO BE THE ARCHITECTURE PIECE TO ACTUALLY BEGIN A PERMANENT EXPLORATION OF SPACE. SO APOLLO WAS AWESOME. >> YEAH! >> NO ONE’S GOING TO DENY THAT. WE’VE LANDED PEOPLE ON THE MOON. >> RIGHT. >> BUT THAT WAS ALL IT WAS DESIGNED TO DO, AND IT DIDN’T REALLY SET US UP FOR LONG TERM EXPLORATION. WE DIDN’T HAVE AN OUTPOST. WE DIDN’T HAVE PLANS FOR WHAT TO DO NEXT. >> YEAH. >> BUT ORION WAS REALLY-- AND THE SPACE LAUNCH SYSTEM-- YOU COULD THEN LAUNCH BIG PIECES WHERE WE CAN START TO BUILD AN OUTPOST. SO WE CAN BUILD A SMALL LITTLE MINI, MINI, MINI SPACE STATION AROUND THE MOON WHERE WE CAN START DOING MUCH MORE DIFFICULT EXERCISES, WHERE THE CREW IS OUT THERE FOR MONTHS AT THE MOON, WHERE YOU CAN’T COME HOME WITHIN HOURS FROM THE SPACE STATION. >> YEAH. >> SO IT’S MORE OF AN ENGINEERING CHALLENGE ON YOUR DESIGN. >> YEAH. >> AND SO WE CAN START TESTING OUT SOME OF THOSE DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION THINGS, AND THEN LONGER TERM, YOU’LL BE ABLE TO START ASSEMBLING A MARS VEHICLE OUT THERE. SO WE CAN START FLYING THE PIECES UP, BECAUSE TO GO TO MARS, THAT’S A TWO YEAR MISSION. SO WE NEED A BIG HABITAT. YOU’D NEED A LOT OF FOOD AND A LOT OF WATER, AND BIG SOLAR ARRAYS. SO IN ORDER TO START TESTING SOME OF THOSE TECHNOLOGIES YOU NEED FOR A MARS VEHICLE, ORION CAN HELP BE A PART OF THAT LUNAR PHASE OF NOW DOING THAT TESTING AND THE VEHICLE DESIGNS WE’RE GOING TO NEED FOR THE FUTURE. SO IT’S REALLY SETTING THE STAGE FOR A LONG-TERM EXPLORATION. THE FIRST, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THE SPACE STATION, WHICH CAN TEST A LOT OF THINGS FOR THE CREW. THEY’RE TESTING CLOSED LOOP DESIGNS, AND WE DO A LOT OF STUFF LIKE THAT. IF WE START BUILDING THINGS OUT AROUND THE MOON, WE’RE NOW CHALLENGING OURSELVES FOR RELIABILITY AND VEHICLE DESIGN. AND NOT BEING ABLE TO COME HOME QUICKLY CHANGES YOUR PERCEPTION A LOT ON HOW YOU DESIGN YOUR VEHICLES. >> OH, YEAH. >> AND THEN EVENTUALLY, USING THAT AS A STAGING GROUND FOR GOING TO MARS AND BEYOND. SO THAT’S REALLY THE VISION OF-- FIRST YOU BUILD A BIG ROCKET AND ORION, AND THEN WE CAN KEEP BUILDING THE OTHER PIECES TO KEEP GOING. SO APOLLO WAS A FOCUSED-- LAND ON THE MOON AND THAT WAS IT. NOW WE’RE TRYING TO SET THE STAGE FOR A LONG TERM EXPLORATION PROJECT. >> AND IT SEEMS LIKE-- I MEAN, HONESTLY, JUST FROM TALKING WITH A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT GUESTS ON THIS SHOW, INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION PLAYS A HUGE ROLE IN THAT AS WELL. LIKE WHAT WE’RE DOING AND LEARNING THERE CAN BE APPLIED TO, LIKE YOU SAID, THIS OUTPOST THAT’S GOING TO BE AROUND THE MOON. AND THEN WHAT WE DO AND LEARN ON ORION IS GOING TO LEARN FOR MISSIONS BEYOND, BECAUSE NOW YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT THE SPACE CAMPER GOING AROUND THE MOON AND HAVING TO BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND HAVING A CREW THERE FOR-- YOU SAID UP TO THREE WEEKS. >> THREE WEEKS ON ORION. ONCE YOU BUILT A LITTLE OUTPOST, YOU CAN STAY FOR MONTHS AT A TIME AROUND THE MOON. >> THAT’S WHAT I MEAN, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. >> AND SO WE’VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THESE PIECES ONE AT A TIME, RIGHT? WE DON’T HAVE AN ENDLESS BUDGET. WE CAN’T DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE, WHICH WOULD BE AWESOME IF WE COULD, BUT REALISTICALLY WE NEED TO MAKE INCREMENTAL STEPS. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> AND AS LONG AS WE’RE PROGRESSING, WE’RE DOING SOMETHING. >> YEAH. SO I MEAN, DO YOU THINK ORION WILL PLAY A ROLE-- I MEAN, IT SOUNDS LIKE ORION’S GOING TO PLAY A PRETTY DECENT ROLE IN THIS OUTPOST AROUND THE MOON. DO YOU THINK IT’LL PLAY A ROLE IN A MARS MISSION? >> ABSOLUTELY. SO ONCE YOU WANT TO GO TO MARS, YOU’RE STILL GOING TO USE ORION TO GET TO YOUR MARS VEHICLE, RIGHT? >> OH, THERE YOU GO. >> AND YOU’LL USE ORION TO GET HOME FROM THE MARS VEHICLE. YOU DON’T WANT TO HAVE TO REBUILD THESE THINGS OVER AND OVER. SO REALLY, BY BUILDING ORION, YOU’RE GOING TO KEEP BUILDING CARBON COPIES IN THE FUTURE. AND WE’VE GOT SOME UPGRADES PLANNED, SO IT’S NOT GOING TO BE ALL A PERFECT CARBON COPY. BUT FOR THE MOST PART, YOU’VE GOT YOUR VEHICLE THAT SAFELY GETS THE CREW OFF THE EARTH AND HOME AGAIN. AND THEN THAT’LL BE USED FOR THOSE MARS MISSIONS TO GET THE CREW TO THE MARS VEHICLE, AND THEN YOU’LL GO DO YOUR MARS MISSION, AND THEN YOU COME HOME AGAIN IN ORION. SO THIS ISN’T-- IT DOESN’T END. >> RIGHT. >> ORION, LIKE SHUTTLE, SHOULD BE A MULTI-DECADAL PROGRAM WHEN IT’S ALL SAID AND DONE, AND YOU’LL JUST KEEP USING IT. >> WOW, OKAY. I MEAN, IT’S JUST SO COOL TO THINK THAT THIS IS OUR PLAN. AND IT SOUNDS LIKE-- YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT AT THE END THERE-- WE ALREADY HAVE UPGRADES PLANNED. THIS IS NOT THE END ALL, BE ALL. WE HAVE TO KEEP IMPROVING. THIS IS HOW WE DO IT, RIGHT? >> RIGHT. SO I MEAN, THE HARDEST PART IS GETTING IT TO FLY THE FIRST TIME. >> YEAH. >> AND SO RIGHT-- LIKE I SAID, WE DIDN’T PUT LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS ON FOR EM-1, BECAUSE THERE’S NO CREW. SO THE FIRST OBVIOUS UPGRADE FOR EM-2 IS TO PUT THE LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM ON. AND SO THERE’S SOME THINGS LIKE THAT. YOU DON’T WANT TO KEEP HAVING TO UPGRADE ORION, BUT THERE’S A FEW THINGS YOU COULD DO TO MAKE IT BETTER IF YOU CHANGE THE MISSION DESIGN. SAY YOU WANTED TO GO TO A LOW LUNAR ORBIT IN THE FUTURE. WE’D NEED TO ADD A SUBLIMATOR TO REJECT SOME OF THE HEAT, BECAUSE IT’S ACTUALLY KIND OF HOT AROUND THE MOON. >> OH! >> SO THERE’S THINGS WE CAN DO, AND WE’RE SORT OF PROTECTING FOR THOSE THINGS SO THAT IF THE CHANGES HAPPEN-- WE DON’T REALLY KNOW EXACTLY HOW THOSE FUTURE VEHICLES ARE GOING TO SHAPE UP-- YOU COULD TWEAK ORION. AND I WOULDN’T REALLY SO MUCH CALL IT CHANGE ORION AS TWEAKING IT TO MAKE SURE IT’S SUPPORTING THE MISSIONS THAT YOU NEED. SO I MEAN, WE’RE PROTECTING FOR A FEW THINGS, AND WE’VE GOT SOME SPACE LEFT SO THAT IF WE NEED TO ADD SOMETHING, THERE’S ROOM TO PUT A FEW MORE THINGS ON. AND SO IT’S JUST SORT OF UNDEFINED SPACES, BUT THAT GIVES YOU OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THOSE TWEAKS THAT YOU NEED. YOU’RE NOT GOING TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE SHAPE, OR THE PARACHUTES, OR THE REENTRY SYSTEMS, BUT WE HAVE EXTENSIBLE CAPABILITIES THAT YOU COULD ADD ON LATER. >> WOW, ALL RIGHT. SO I MEAN, I’VE ASKED A COUPLE GUESTS BEFORE THIS, AND I LOVE ASKING THIS QUESTION. I THINK IT’S A GOOD QUESTION TO KIND OF END ON, IS-- WE’RE DESIGNING ORION TO BE A HUMAN SPACE EXPLORATION VEHICLE, TO TAKE HUMANS FURTHER OUT. AND WE HAVE ROVERS THAT ARE ALREADY ON MARS, ORBITING AROUND MARS, GOING TO DIFFERENT PLANETS. AND YEAH, THAT’S COOL, AND THERE’S A LOT OF ROBOTIC MISSIONS, BUT WHY HUMANS? WHY DO WE SEND HUMANS OUT TO EXPLORE THE SOLAR SYSTEM? >> SO I MEAN, THERE’S THE SCIENCE ANSWER, RIGHT: HUMANS-- ROBOTS ARE AWESOME, BUT HUMANS CAN DO WHAT ROBOTS ARE DOING WITHIN A MATTER OF HOURS, RIGHT? YOU KNOW, A SIX MONTH ROVER ON MARS CAN BE DONE IN HOURS TO DAYS WITH HUMANS BECAUSE THEY CAN TRAVEL FASTER, THEY CAN SEE THINGS, THEY CAN PROCESS THINGS REAL TIME. >> ALL RIGHT. >> BUT THEN THERE’S THE HUMANITY ANSWER, RIGHT? >> YEAH! >> YOU KNOW, ALL THESE THINGS WE’RE DOING IS TO IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY AND BRING HUMANITY TOGETHER. SO SENDING PEOPLE, HAVING THAT CHALLENGE IS A UNITING FORCE. >> YES. >> SO SPACE EXPLORATION IS STILL ONE OF THE ONLY PEACEFUL ACTIVITIES HUMANS DO. SO I’D LIKE TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. >> ABSOLUTELY. WE HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION ALREADY, AND EVEN ORION IS AN INTERNATIONAL EFFORT, RIGHT? YOU ALREADY SAID WE’RE WORKING WITH THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY, AND THEY HAVE A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO MAKE ORION POSSIBLE, AND CAN’T DO IT WITHOUT THEM. WE NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK, AND YOU’RE RIGHT-- IT’S FOR A PEACEFUL MISSION, SO ABSOLUTELY LOVE THAT. WELL, NUJOUD, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. AND I MEAN, THAT’S A SUPER HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW, BUT THAT’S WHAT MORE PODCASTS ARE FOR. MORE PODCAST EPISODES ARE FOR GOING INTO THE DETAILS AND STUFF LIKE THAT, BUT THAT IS JUST-- I THOUGHT THAT WAS A PERFECT EXPLANATION OF WHAT ORION IS ALL ABOUT. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. FOR THOSE LISTENING, IF YOU WANT TO STAY TUNED UNTIL AFTER THE MUSIC OR CREDITS HERE, WE’LL TELL YOU HOW TO FOLLOW ORION’S MISSION AND PAY ATTENTION TO THE STORY ON SOCIAL NETWORKS AND EVERYTHING. SO NUJOUD, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. >> YOU’RE WELCOME. THANKS FOR HAVING ME. >> ABSOLUTELY. [ MUSIC ] [ INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ] >> WELCOME TO SPACE. >> HEY, THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND. SO TODAY, WE TALKED ABOUT THE ORION SPACECRAFT WITH NUJOUD MERANCY. AND WE REALLY, HONESTLY JUST SKIMMED THE SURFACE. I HAD A LOT THAT I REALLY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WITH NUJOUD, BUT WE SORT OF RAN OUT OF TIME. AND THERE’S BEEN-- ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS I REALLY WANTED US TO TALK ABOUT WITH HER TODAY WAS JUST BESIDES THE WHOLE ORION THING, I REALLY WANTED TO GO OVER SOME OF THE TESTS THAT THEY’VE BEEN DOING. WE’LL PROBABLY FOLLOW UP WITH AN EPISODE LATER ABOUT SOME OF THOSE TESTS, BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO TO NASA.GOV/ORION AND CHECK THOSE OUT NOW, THERE’S A LOT OF THEM. THEY HAD WATER DROP TESTS, AND EGRESS TESTS, AND PARACHUTE TESTS, LAUNCH ABORT-- WHATEVER YOU WANT. ACTUALLY, WE DO HAVE A LAUNCH ABORT EFFORT COMING UP HERE SOON. BUT IF YOU WANT TO CHECK IT OUT, JUST GO TO NASA.GOV/ORION. YOU CAN FIND IT OUT NOW. ON SOCIAL MEDIA, THEY’RE TALKING ABOUT ALL THE UPDATES AND ALL THE COOL TESTS THAT ARE GOING ON, TOO, ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM. ON FACEBOOK IT’S @NASAORION, TWITTER @NASA_ORION, AND ON INSTAGRAM IT’S @EXPLORENASA. ALL OF THEM ARE VERIFIED, SO YOU CAN FIND THEM PRETTY EASY. BUT IF YOU WANT TO, USE THE HASHTAG #ASKNASA ON ANY ONE OF THOSE PLATFORMS, AND JUST MENTION “HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST.” WE’LL GET YOU SOME OF THOSE ANSWERS SHORTLY. WE HAVE A LOT OF EPISODES COMING UP ON ALL DIFFERENT TOPICS, SO WE’LL JUST TRY TO FIT THAT INTO ONE OF THE EPISODES LATER. SO THIS PODCAST WAS RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2017. THANKS TO ALEX PERRYMAN, JOHN STOLL, AND RACHEL KRAFT. AND THANKS AGAIN TO MRS. NUJOUD MERANCY FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. WE’LL BE BACK NEXT WEEK.",

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 151, “Rendezvous with Mars.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. We're continuing our Mars Monthly series with Patrick Chai Ph.D, who humbly requested to be referred to as an aerospace engineer at Langley Research Center in Virginia, but most would call him a rocket scientist. Patrick hones in on the challenges and needs for getting to Mars. The journey from Earth to Mars will be long, somewhere on the order of nine months. And with that, comes a series of challenges, some complicated orbital mechanics, and a whole range of options that consider things like propulsion, duration, timing, staging, and more. Yes, thanks to probes and rovers of the past we've landed on Mars, but a human landing will be like nothing else before. The transport will have to be much larger. And with humans onboard, you're limited on the kinds of routes you can take to get to Mars. Sounds like a simple consideration. Yes, of course there will be humans, but it makes things a lot harder. Buckle up everybody and all aboard to the red planet. Here we go. The challenges and range of options on how to rendezvous with Mars with Patrick Chai. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Patrick, thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.  Patrick Chai: Thanks for having me.  Host: This is a really interesting and intricate discussion we're going to have about what it takes to actually get to Mars. So, I might go a little bit off track. You are going to have to steer me to Mars in the right way. Tell me about your background and what got you to the path where you're thinking about Mars rendezvous?  Patrick Chai: Well, I haven't been at NASA very long. I started in the fall of 2014. I was a graduate student at Langley as well, doing some system analysis for different refueling options. So, I was a grad student. So, I got my Ph.D. from Georgia Tech. And Georgia Tech has a program at Langley associated with the National Institute of Aerospace, where grad students can, you know, be on-site there at Langley doing research with folks. And so, kind of gravitated me towards doing system analysis. So that's how I ended up applying for a job at the branch I am in, which is a space mission analysis branch. And once I started there, that's back when there was a big effort, defining what then was called the Evolvable Mars Campaign as part of President Obama's flexible path definition, you know, going to the asteroids and, you know, having multiple paths getting -- humans to Mars. So, I started doing a lot of the trajectory work for -- for the Evolvable Mars Campaign and doing the definitions of how, you know, all the different mission opportunities and how much propellant it would take if we have, you know, different payloads and things like that. So that kind of evolved into me kind of being the lead of the trajectory analysis team there for -- for all the Mars stuff and now I'm leading the Mars Integration Group here at NASA Langley. But I still want to do trajectory work because that's the most important. That's – the exciting things I like to do. Leading team is great, but it's like one of those curses, you know, you move up and become management and they don't let you do exciting work anymore [laughter].  Host: You have to delegate, delegate --  Patrick Chai: Yeah, exactly. It's hard man. Learning how to delegate is a hard thing to do.  Host: Yeah, especially when you want to do --  Patrick Chai: Exactly.  Host: You want to get your hands dirty.  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: So, you mentioned, you've alluded to a few different things in your description of what you're thinking about. You're thinking about systems, you're thinking about trajectories, what are these different elements that you're considering when you're thinking how do we get to Mars?  Patrick Chai: So, you know, for what are we thinking about here. It's always, you know, sending crew to Mars right. So, we have -- we have a propulsion element that, you know, you need some sort of propulsion element to get, you know, your crew to and from Mars right, and the payload that you need to deliver. So, typically, you have a, you know, very traditionally you have a chemical stage and so, you have, you know, kind of like a regular rocket. You have, you know, fuel and oxidizer and, you know, they come into a combustion chamber and they combust and then you exhaust that out of the nozzle and that's how you push things. Right? And -- for Mars, you either pushing the Deep Space Habitat where the crew lives in or a payload which is what we call cargo, which is the lander that you need to land things on -- Mars surface.  Host: OK, so -- so you're thinking about the energy, the type of energy it takes to actually get to Mars --  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: And what you're going to attach to that energy.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, and so, you know, you -- for the integrated stack, you have your propulsion elements, and you have a payload and you have to be able to get that -- all those things put together in orbit, and then you send that to Mars, and not only you have to send it to Mars, it has to have enough energy for you to come back too. So, you think about a big rocket, you know, as a reference, like a big rocket you're launching from Cape Canaveral, you know, that is very short distance that they -- it has to do comparatively to where we're needing to go to Mars. So, you can imagine the energy that it would need to go all the way to Mars, it's pretty significant.  Host: Yeah. So, what's the difference when you're thinking -- we're talking about the system level now, we're talking about what you need to actually build to get to Mars. What differs when you add the human element?  Patrick Chai: So, when you add the human element, it's kind of different, right? So, if you think about, you know, things we've sent to Mars, all the rovers and things like that, you know, those systems have a lifetime, right. But you know, it's electronics, it's -- powered by battery or solar arrays or what not, they can take a much slower route to Mars which's much more energy efficient, right. When you have a crew onboard, you have other considerations because, you know, if you have a longer duration in space, that means you have to bring more food, that means you have to bring -- you have to have a bigger space for the crew, you have to have exercise equipment for the crew. So, what -- what that actually translates to is you have more payload, you have more mass, you have to push -- you're pushing more things and that -- we call it the tyranny of the rocket equation. It's an exponential relationship. So, you add one, you know, you add one kilogram or one pound of payload. It's not equivalent to one pound of propellant. It's, you know, a much, much bigger amount. So, it can add up really quick. So, for a human mission and it'll be a little bit for the -- for the robotic too, you know, it's all about minimizing that payload mass as much as possible. And these rovers that, you know, that [Jet Propulsion Laboratory] JPL is sending to Mars, I mean, they are very slimmed down, even though they're very beefy and they're very reliable. But they are always looking for different ways to do, you know, manufacturing and fabrication of these components to minimize the weight because weight is everything in space.  Host: Yeah. Yeah, so I guess, does -- maybe this might be a ridiculous question, but does thinking about having larger systems to get to Mars change your trajectory or your possibilities of how to get there?  Patrick Chai: Um, it doesn't really change the trajectory.  Host: OK.  Patrick Chai: Maybe a little bit, but it changes the way you think about how to get to that trajectory. So, everything we've sent to Mars so far, you're thinking about these, basically, your traditional rocket, you know. And these are, you know, we're getting much, much more efficient with them, but they're very, I won't say rudimentary, but these are, you know, systems that we've -- we've been using for decades, right. And they have their limits in terms of how energy efficient, how much, you know, what we call specific impulse -- impulse that it can deliver. And specifically, we'll measure kind of the -- how much -- energy you can get out of the same amount of propellant. So, the higher you -- higher that explosive impulse is, the better your system at being efficient. So, your traditional rocket you're looking at maybe, you know, 300 to 400 seconds with a specific impulse and there's a whole, you know, derivation equations. I don't exactly know why they -- use seconds as the -- as the unit, but it falls out of the equation. But for a traditional chemical, you're looking at 300 to 400 seconds of specific impulse. And, you know, with starting to think about some of these other, you know, kind of lower thrust and higher energy propulsion systems like the solar electric propulsion or a nuclear electric propulsion systems that can get you up to, you know, 3000 to 4,000 seconds worth of specific impulse -- that increase tenfold. The drawback of that is you ended up having to stretch your in-space duration longer because it, you know, it naturally is a lower thrust propulsion system. So, that's always the battle, you have -- you have a low thrust and a high thrust system. A high thrust system kind of, you know, is a really big kick to get you out and you can do a little -- another kick to kind of slow you down at Mars. And that's relatively fast. Low thrust, you kind of -- just like putzing along, you know, for a much longer duration, but ultimately it saves you a lot of propellant. And -- it's a much more robust too, if you increase your payload mass by a significant amount. It's much more robust to be able to absorb some of that growth, so.  Host: Oh, OK, so there's a lot of different factors your considering.  Patrick Chai: Yeah. And -- what actually we have been working on in the last three, four years is actually kind of marrying the two. We've been working on what we call a hybrid propulsion system. And it's kind of -- it has both components. It has a high thrust and a low thrust system. So, you use the high thrust when you're near -- planets where they are actually most effective. And -- you know, because you're -- you have to, you know, no matter what, you -- have a long duration transit out to Mars and back anyway. So, you might as well use some of that time to do some thrusting and do some maneuvering. And we've -- we found that the system that we've kind of, you know, been analyzing has some advantages and some disadvantages, but that's how all this -- and that's important, I think, from, you know, what we -- what we always harp on from our -- branch, the system analysis -- analysis perspective. We have to be able to understand the behavior of the system. Especially under uncertainty and under changing requirements in order to understand what you're actually selecting. You can't just say, oh, because we have this very, very tiny optimized point design, we're going to select this -- this propulsion option. Well, what if your design changes a little bit, you know, how sensitive you are -- your system is to that change, and we need to have a better understanding of all that before we make -- before we're able to make really informed decisions.  Host: So, I mean, a hybrid approach sounds very reasonable because you're considering the -- flexibility, naturally when it comes to spaceflight with flexibility comes mass. Now you're talking about two different propulsion systems.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, actually, it's -- it's kind of -- yeah, you know, it's actually less in terms of mass. It's more on the complexity side.  Host: Interesting.  Patrick Chai: In terms of mass, like, you know, given the same payload and the propulsion system, it depends on the trajectory you fly. The chemical is going to be the heaviest, and then the full [Electric Propulsion] EP up is going to be the lightest. But, you know, you trade time with that too, right? You know, the -- the big rocket will get there -- get you there the fastest, but the slow boat electric propulsion will get there, you know, much slower. So, we're trying to, you know -- so like, for instance, we have some planetary probes that are flying out there that uses electric propulsion, and then they've been very successful in doing that. But, you know, these things take years and years to get to wherever they're going. And so, it's great for the -- for the planetary probe, you know, because they don't really care about, you know, how long it takes to get there as long as they get there and do the science they need to do. But when you have crew onboard, you can't really use that as consideration, right? Because you have to -- you can't just say, oh, we're going to have, you know, we're going to take three years just to get to Mars one way, right. It's -- you know, it's a nonstarter because all the food and everything you have to bring. Unless we can figure out how to cryo-freeze people, I guess [laughter]. That would be a different ballgame [laughter].  Host: Wow. I mean, this -- that's one of the key elements here, we're talking about sending humans to Mars. And that -- with that you -- one of the requirements is -- is speed.  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: You need to get there faster.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, you need to get there, you know, in a reasonable amount of time before all your consumables and things like that run out, right. Or you have to bring so much that you never even get started. Right.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: And so that's always the challenge, right? Because you -- you know, with exploring, I always use kind of the analogy of Christopher Columbus sailing across the Atlantic Ocean, right. When they leave, they had -- there was -- there was no expectation that they have any sort of, you know, stoppage and things like that on, you know, during the voyage, right.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: And so, they're hoping that, you know, fingers crossed that they can get all the way to wherever they're going and resupply, so they are planning however long they -- were planning to sail. And, you know, at least -- the good news for us is that at least we know where we're -- our destination instead of going sailing into the unknown. But to kind of, you know, give you some context, I mean, Columbus sailed in, you know, the late 1400s. And they got to the -- I think the first trip they left the Spanish coast and got to, I think the Bahamas. That, you know, was like 6,500 kilometers worth of distance they traveled, you know, across the Atlantic Ocean in like 30 something days. If -- if you use that same distance they traveled as, you know, if you -- if you say, OK, that's the same distance that you know, from Earth to Mars. The Moon, which is the furthest humans has ever been, is only two and a half miles off the coast.  Host: Oh.  Patrick Chai: So, give you some scale [laughter]. So, on all human existence, we've only gone two and a half miles off of the Spanish coast.  Host: Wow.  Patrick Chai: And we're trying to get across the Atlantic Ocean to the new world.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: And trying to plan for that. And -- and so that -- that kind of gives you that scale. And I think people, you know, think oh yeah, we -- you know, we -- because we sent probes, you know, and things like that it should be easy, but it's -- it's not at all because it's -- one of the most -- I think fundamentally the most challenging things. That's why we've been looking at it for -- since the Apollo time, right. Because it is that challenging.  Host: Well, tell me a little bit more about what -- what is so challenging about it when it comes to the orbital mechanics of it all that -- how you're limited with your opportunities, how, you know, you can't really turn around.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, so we are, you know, very much governed by what, you know, the mechanics and the gravity and -- I struggle a lot, you know, talking to just, you know, people, you know, like my family and things like that, like what I do, it's not easy to like, have them understand that. So, I like to use the -- the train analogy and, you know, imagine like, you have -- you know, miniature train sets or big train sets -- I don't really want to know what you want to play with. But, you know, Earth and Mars are moving around the sun, like -- like they are on train tracks, you know, circular or ellipsoid train tracks, right. So, it's spinning around, but they're moving at different speed. Right? So, your goal of getting from one to the other is you're -- you're standing on one of the train track -- on the trains, you know, moving with the train, and you're trying to throw an egg across to -- and have it land on the other train without it breaking. Right? And so -- so it's all -- it's not only do you have to like have enough energy to throw it. You also have to have enough energy to slow it down so that -- when it lands -- when it gets to the train, it doesn't, you know, just splatter, right. That's kind of like a basic analogy of how you, you know, what it takes. So, you can think about, you know, imagine like, if the trains are on, you know, opposite ends of the circle, right? You know, they're not in sync, right?  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: You're not going to be able to, you know -- you could, it would just take a lot more energy to throw and to -- you know, and slow down, right. And so you -- you're -- basically what we're doing with Mars in terms of mission opportunities is that we're waiting for the trains to kind of align itself to the proper, you know, proper orientations for us to kind of maximize the use of the velocity, the speed of our train, and maximize the speed, you know, on arrival of, you know, the Mars train kind of.  Host: Yeah, what you're trying to do is you're trying to limit how, how hard you have to throw this egg.  Patrick Chai: Right, you -- how hard you have to throw there, and you have to limit how hard you have to push back when -- when you get to Mars. I remember seeing -- it was a great video that Mythbusters did where they had a cannon strapped to the back of a truck and then they drove it at 50 miles an hour and they shot the cannon off the back and it kind of just fell on the ground.  Host: I saw that one. Yeah.  Patrick Chai: You're basically doing that at Mars, right? And because you want to kind of just like be the same relative velocity. Because you're moving fast compared to Mars, right? And you have to fire engines, you know, fire a rocket, your cannon, the other way to kind of slow down and drop in Mars. So, you want to minimize that as well, because that's all, you know, we call it delta V, change in velocity. And that drives how much propellant you need. That drives how much your -- your propulsion system has to be in terms of, you know, thrust and size, and all that and it kind of snowballs into this giant vehicle that you have to take to Mars. So then, you know, minimizing that is the goal, right? And that's why we have very -- these -- these very what we call conjunction style trajectory that kind of minimizes that energy.  Host: OK, so how often do those opportunities come up?  Patrick Chai: Typically, the Earth/Mars synodic cycle is about 26 months, so every 26-ish month, you get one of those opportunities. That's why, you know, for JPL, their rovers, they launch every two-ish years or so. So, this one, we have Mars 2020 now coming up this year, the last one was launched in 2018. So that's kind of the cycle that we have. Every 26 months or so we have these kind of conjunction opportunities.  Host: Now, is there a factor you have to add into this whenever you're looking at these opportunities for the fact that humans are going to be on this vehicle and that you're going to have to return at some point?  Patrick Chai: Well, yeah, that's always -- that's always the trick, right? People always think, you know, oh, one way, right. No, we have the, you know, it's -- it's a round trip. So, back to the train analogy. You know, once you get to Mars, you, you know, in order to minimize the energy coming home, you have to kind of again, wait for the train to kind of get back into the proper alignment for you to come home. So typically, a conjunction style full round-trip mission, you're, on average about 180 to 260 days, maybe up to 300 days, you know, out to Mars transit time. And you stay on the surface or stay at Mars for 300 to 500 days waiting for the planet to realign and then you come home on the same low minimum energy trajectory. So yeah, so you have a whole round trip about three years is typical, very, very typical. Now with different technology, high and low thrusts, those duration do fluctuate here and there a little bit. But typically, you're looking at 900 to, you know, 1100 days of total, what we call time away from Earth, because that's, you know, the days start counting when you push the button to leave Earth.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: There might be more time the crew has to spend near Earth to, you know, they have to launch, they have to get into the spacecraft. And get everything checked out before they can even do that. So, you have to kind of back that out even further to, you know, to get all the total crew time in space, which may be a little -- little more maybe 100 days more than -- then when the total Mars mission. Some opportunities, mission opportunities are a little shorter, some are longer because the Earth and Mars orbit are not perfectly circular around the sun. So, they do have variations in the -- in the distance. So, some take a little longer, some a little faster -- sometimes a little faster. So yeah, a lot -- a lot to kind of, there's just a lot of variability and -- and we have to -- we do have to take that into consideration. Because we've -- we've had -- we've gone into some, you know, bad rabbit holes and oh, you know, this mission opportunity is really, really easy. Let's design to that. Well, if you do that, then if you miss it, you can't go ever again, or you can't go for 20 years.  Host: You have to have some flexibility --  Patrick Chai: Right. Exactly.  Host: Design your system is to meet these different --  Patrick Chai: Yeah. And there's one of the things that we harp is, is we need to be robust with -- with our design, because we understand that whatever we plan, there's always a risk of slippage, like schedule slippage.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: And -- we need to be robust to that. And that's a challenge, right? Because you're already designing -- designing a system that is, you know, at the hairy edge of the performance, and you're trying to get everything out of the system, you -- you already can, and if you try to build in robust into that, you know, it's -- it's a challenge, because it ends up being really big and bigger than it needs to be for -- you know, it's always the, you know, in every system analysis, and even aerospace -- actually not just aerospace, but engineering in general, there's this debate of robustness versus optimization, right. You know, optimizing, you know, onto the very, very, you know, you know -- being able to optimize to something versus being robust to changes, and then that -- battle is always been an ongoing, so.  Host: Yeah, because optimization is equal to efficiency, but robustness is equal to reliability.  Patrick Chai: Right. Yeah, exactly. So, you know -- and there's a balance to that. You can't, you know, go full bore on one way or the other. Right. And so, yeah, you know, you could theoretically design a vehicle to fly every single mission opportunity. But that's not realistic, right? Because you wouldn't end up -- you will be so unoptimized for every single opportunity that yeah, that you end up with a system that doesn't necessarily closes from other programmatic perspective.  Host: What a challenge. Oh my gosh.  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: Now, what about launch opportunities, you know, launch slips happen all the time.  Patrick Chai: Right.  Host: It's just a regular part of spaceflight.  Patrick Chai: Yeah. So -- so that -- that is the other challenge that we talked to, you know, we talked a little bit about the additional time that you need to account for, right. So, you know, so if you know your -- your launch -- your Earth departure date, right, is certain, you know, to maximize your mission opportunity, you're going to plan for the launch slippage, right? So instead of saying, OK, the crew is launching three days before that Earth departure date, you're going to have to launch -- you're going to have to plan to launch your crew a month, two months before that, that way if this slips you can have that -- and we have a -- we have some folks in the agency who's done some fantastic work on -- launch reliability, and they've done, you know, some great analysis to show, you know, in order to get to a 99% probability of actually getting you to this particular date you have to backtrack and figure out how much -- how many days you need to plan to -- to launch. The launch window, basically.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: So, it's -- it's a little different than like saying going to the ISS or even back then the Apollo program where, you know, a little slippage, you end up -- you can -- you know, the lunar cycle is only 28 days, right? And so, if you miss that magical opportunity, it's -- you wait a month, and it's --  Host: You wait a month?  Patrick Chai: It's not you wait 28 months, or 26 months, right? So, it's, yeah, you have to be robust in that. But there's a limit to that, right? And because you don't want to say, OK, we're launching our crew six months in advance, and they sit around in orbit waiting for their opportunity to go.  Host: Right.  Patrick Chai: Right. And that's -- that's unrealistic. So, it's -- it's, again, back to optimize versus robust, this is the risk versus, you know, how risky you want to -- want to be right. Is your -- is a 99th percentile probability good enough? Is 90th? Is 70th? I don't know, right? That's something that, you know, it's -- a challenge for both engineers and the program managers to understand the risk and understand where we can absorb the risk and where we can't.  Host: Yeah. So, what you're doing is you're -- you're thinking about this -- this wide spectrum of possibilities. You're thinking about how early do we have to launch? And how -- how long is it reasonable for the crew to hang out in low-Earth orbit until they take that Mars injection burn and go to Mars?  Patrick Chai: Right.  Host: What's reasonable there? What are the propulsion technologies that we can consider and what factors into that kind of design? You're just thinking about this whole thing.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, and it's a -- it's an integrated system and campaigns look, right. And that's -- that's more so than just doing like the individual design for systems. And the other, you know, throw you another wrench [laughter]. You know, the longer you wait in orbit, the more your systems degrade, you -- you might have propellant which are cryogenically -- or cryogenic temperatures so they might be boiling off. So you have to top it off, and there's a whole host of discussions and -- on that and that's why there's, you know, there's some discussion about different orbits where you do your -- do your aggregation, different orbits where you do your rendezvous and things like that so that it's -- it's not -- LEO, the lower -- LEO lower-Earth orbit is great because you can throw a lot of stuff into it from a launch vehicle perspective because it's lower. But it's a terrible environment for a spacecraft to hang out long term, especially big spacecraft. The thermal environment is pretty harsh from all of the -- the radiation from coming -- actually reflecting off the Earth from a thermal perspective is not -- not great, but it's also a lot of orbital debris because all the stuff that's up there, so there's a higher chance of that. The benefit is that you're still in the radiation -- in the radiation belt so you're shielded from that. So there's -- there's a trade, you know, if you want to go higher orbit, which is sometimes our preference because you can get out of the thermal environment, you can see out of the -- the overall debris environment, but -- but you take the hit on the radiation for some of your system. But the benefit is that since we're designing a system to go to Mars, all of that system has to be radiation rated and protected anyway, so it's not a huge issue with the exception of solar panels, which do degrade in radiation environment. So, you don't want that to sit in the radiation environment for too long or else it degrades so that you can't generate enough power.  Host: So, where are some of those higher orbits that we're considering?  Patrick Chai: So, we've been talking a lot about orbits around the Moon -- yeah, orbits around the Moon. The Honors Program is you know, with the -- with the Gateway had -- is out there in a -- in a near rectilinear Halo orbit around the Moon. We have these Lagrangian points that a lot of folks are very interested in understanding and -- and what -- what those points really are is you think about from gravity, you know, pulling each other at the Earth and the Moon are in a gravitational pull system. So, the Lagrangian points are just points in the Earth/Moon system that are -- that the gravity between the Earth and the Moon is relatively equal. So, you're not really being pulled by the Earth, you're -- you're being pulled by Earth and the Moon roughly equally. And so those are -- those are points of interest because it's a -- you know, once you get into those points, you know, it's easy to kind of get out of them. And so, you know, if you have a bunch of stuff stacked there, it doesn't cost a lot of energy for it to go -- to leave that orbit again to go somewhere else. And so it's great for our aggregating a lot of -- a lot of things and so, for, you know, what we've been looking at last couple years, with the assumption is always that we would launch all of our elements and components into that, you know, kind of like, we call it -- we just call it cislunar orbit, lunar orbit, just to be generic because we haven't really picked a particular orbit that we want to be in. It could be the same one that the Gateway is at that way we can have some synergy with that program.  Host: Right.  Patrick Chai: But we aggregate all that stuff there. But before Earth departure, you don't really want to depart from that particular orbit. Because you do --  Host: Lagrangian linear --  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: -- Orbit? OK.  Patrick Chai: You don't want to -- you could depart from those, you know, those Lagrangian orbits but you have -- you get a much more benefit from the Earth's gravity if you're leaving from a, you know, Earth orbiting gravity or Earth orbiting orbit. So, basically, what you want to do is you want to come back and kind of swing by the Earth on your way out, that would be much more efficient to be able to do that. So, the assumption is always we come back to a high-Earth orbit. We call lunar distance high-Earth orbit. So, it's a big, big orbit that comes by the Earth and it comes -- when it goes out -- so orbits are always defined by perigee and apogee, a perigee that is closest to the main body and apogee is the distance furthest away. So, your perigee is close to the Earth, but your apogee is actually at lunar distance. So, a lot of our trajectory we -- we've actually been doing a lot of analysis and building a lot of these very intricate trajectory for -- for how we do Earth departure. To try to minimize the energy we need. Right? Typically, you know, when you do your -- what we call the Trans-Mars injection burn so burning for Mars, you come by Earth and you fire on your -- your rocket engine and you burn really hard and you -- you kick out there, which is great and it's fast, but it takes a lot of energy, takes a lot of propellant. So, we're -- you know, when designing our hybrid low and high thrust combination type of propulsion system, we're trying to minimize how much of that chemical burn that we have to do. So, we would design up these pretty intricate trajectories in which we come back into this higher Earth orbit, where the apogee is at lunar distance, and we phase it so that after the crew gets onboard the spacecraft, we target the Moon, we do a lunar flyby and -- and that kicks us out to heliocentric space.  Host: Oh interesting.  Patrick Chai: And then that gives us enough energy to go out. And that -- this only really works for the -- hybrid because technically once you get flung out by the Moon, you don't have enough energy to get to Mars yet. But with the low thrust you can then use the time you have in space to thrust and to kind of keep pushing and pushing harder, and harder, harder for you to catch up to Mars.  Host: OK, so this Moon slingshot thing works only if you have the high -- the solar electric propulsion.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, electric propulsion.  Host: Give you the extra boost.  Patrick Chai: Yeah. So, and because -- yeah, or else, you know, this orbit, if you just slingshot around the Moon you don't have any more propulsion, you eventually fall back into Earth in little like -- like maybe like a year later you catch back on Earth again. But so, you -- you go on a little tour of the -- of the Earth orbits area but you don't -- yeah, you don't -- you're not really going anywhere particularly -- in particular, so.  Host: Yeah, so -- so that brings up a good point. So, let's say for whatever reason you do that Mars or that Moon slingshot, but your solar electric propulsion doesn't kick in. Now, you got to swing back. You're hanging out in space for a year.  Patrick Chai: Yeah. Yeah, that's always the challenge.  Host: Right.  Patrick Chai: Well, you know, there is this quote unquote, “abort.\" I think people, you know, like, you know, not their fault. Like, when people say, abort, you know, everybody have a good understanding what that is, right? Because we have all these abort scenarios, like, you know, oh, you're coming back home pretty quickly, and things like that. But yeah, man, when you're in heliocentric space it's -- it's not that simple. It's -- and it's -- it takes a lot of energy to come -- to turn around and burn home. For your -- kind of like a low thrust, you just do a lunar gravity assist. Let's say your scenario, your electric propulsion system just craps out and doesn't do anything. The benefit is that you still have your chemical propulsion system. So, you could theoretically -- and you're not -- you're -- in terms of your overall energy, you're not that far from Earth. We haven't really done the analysis to understand how quickly you can get back. That's really, really dependent on the orbit of the particular date you're looking at, and things like that. But we do have some analysis done on the high thrust side of things, you know, after you do your big burn can you -- you know, I guess in those scenarios is like, oh, if a crew has some issues and need to come home, how -- what are the options, right? And, honestly, it's pretty limited, even with like, you know, this is one of the benefits of -- people have touted for the nuclear thermal propulsion system which has is -- it's kind of like a -- it's kind of like the chemical but instead of combustion in the -- using the propellant, you're using a nuclear reactor to, you know, heat up the fuel and expand it out. So, it has a higher specific impulse. But you have to carry a nuclear reactor around which has its own challenges. But they talk about these abort scenarios because -- because it has the efficiency that -- that the chemical system doesn't have, but that's still, you know, once you kick out and especially those high thrust trajectory, you're much, much higher energy. So, in order for you to turn around and burn back this -- burn back towards Earth, it's not a straight shot, you know, it's not like me, you know, doing a U turn and coming home. There's -- there's no -- U turn really to be done. You almost have to burn enough so that you fly by -- you do a really close swing by of the sun and come back and catch back up on Earth -- with Earth again, and that -- that could take you know, a year or so, or six months. Depending on when that burn happens, so the challenge we've always had when -- when these type of questions come up is, in what scenario do you have a crew, I guess, crew health situation where, you know, the full, you know, Mars mission three years round trip is not acceptable, but a six months, one year return is acceptable, right? What -- what scenario are you thinking about? Because, you know, I always say, I don't know what the scenario is, right.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: And so that's -- that's the I think that -- and it's important to have that discussion. Because we need to understand where these questions are coming from, and the people's concerns about -- about all this and understanding, like the scenarios in which they want to protect for and this is, again, back to the risk thing, right? If we want to protect for certain scenarios, we can run the analysis to show what it would cost, right and then it's up to the decision maker to, you know, weigh the cost benefit analysis. Say do we want to protect for this one or not? What are the probability of this actually happening? And -- we from a system analysis perspective need to show, you know, OK, if you want to protect for this risk here are the implications and how that -- you know, how that system change impacts the rest of the other systems that are related, right.  Host: Yeah. This goes back to what you're thinking about, which is this wide range of possibilities. Thinking about propulsion technology, when you're thinking about possible trajectories or in the orbital mechanics of it all, how to design a mission profile, however long it may be. That's a, you know, they're all worthy discussions to have. But I think we're -- really what it comes down to is a mission to Mars is a risk, you know, like --  Patrick Chai: Yeah, absolutely.  Host: You can't make it risk free.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, absolutely.  Host: That would be amazing, but it's just not the way it is.  Patrick Chai: Yeah. It's like going skydiving, right.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: There's some inherent risk in that and there's nothing you can do to remove all the risk, right? And so, we can sit here and talk about, you know -- and engineering design system to be as risk free as possible, but it will not be zero percent risk, right? I mean, inherently, I mean, just getting on the rocket and going into space is probably the riskiest part of you know -- could be one of the riskiest part of the whole endeavor. Right? And so, at some point, we are -- we will -- we have to be willing to take risk, right. And I think one of the challenges we have as an agency, especially when it comes to the Mars program, is that number one, it's -- it's so challenging, right, we've kind of established how difficult it is. So, we need to have these hard discussions about risk, and cost, and schedule, and programmatics, and things like that. But -- but it's -- it's also double challenging because it's so far away always it seems like.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: Right? It's hard to make decisions now, the hard decisions that might not have impact till 10, 15 years down the road.  Host: Let's talk about the Moon to Mars. What we're -- what we're striving for right now.  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: You already mentioned a little bit about the Artemis program and what we can learn about the near rectilinear Halo orbit and some of the technologies needed for Gateway. What will that help inform when it comes to some of these propulsion technologies and some of the ways that we're thinking about how the Moon can help us get to Mars?  Patrick Chai: Yeah, from the propulsions perspective, I mean, that's one of the benefit, right, what -- you know, for the -- you know, what we -- what we've been looking at the -- the sub cam hybrid is that the electric propulsion thrusters that we are, you know, that we're planning on potentially using for Mars transit is -- being planned for the Gateway as well. Right. And so, there are some synergy there. And there's some, you know, obviously, there's -- will be some challenges with the development cycle because the power level is totally different, right? But there's, you know, you kind of draw a little family tree back up to that -- that particular design. I think the big thing for the Artemis program is kind of how the private -- private public partnership is kind of, you know, unfolding in front of our eyes. I think getting kind of the framework for this -- for this private public partnership as part of the Artemis program, understanding how we can leverage a lot of things that are happening in the -- in the industry -- in the private sector, can really inform and really drive how we think about designing the mission and think about how we either procure or leverage all the things that are happening and, you know, obviously the private industry have quite different objectives compared to what the government and NASA wants to do. We want to explore, we want to, you know, expand our knowledge and -- really drive and push the technological boundaries. And so that part is -- has to be the forefront of what we -- try to plan for. And I think we are. But I think the industry in terms of their push for innovation in areas that the government might not be interested in is also very beneficial because they are very interested in streamlining the manufacturing process, being more efficient with their design cycle and -- how robust their systems are in the way they do their testing.  Host: So, a lot we can learn from the commercial way of operating things --  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: Implementing commercial partnership.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, you know, just under -- having synergy with a lot of things they're doing and leveraging some of the stuff they're -- leverage -- having just -- just dialogue and just understanding how they're doing their, you know, business model, if you want to call it and how we can learn from that, right, and change the way we're doing testing and doing developments and things like that. You know, in all industry and in tech in particular, you know, you need to have these kind of breakthrough and these industry kind of breaking, you know, moments, right, and to kind of drive us out of these kinds of complacency that we're in. And, you know, at some point, we got to decide, yeah, we got -- we want to go to Mars, and we want to be able to do certain things, and we just have to, you know, push for it.  Host: Yeah. So, it's that there is a balance I feel between innovation, you know, trying new things and doing things a certain way and maybe the tradition does have a certain benefit of precedence.  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: It informs what is possible because --  Patrick Chai: As long as we learn from our history, and we, you know, we learn from the mistakes we've -- made, right. You know, I struggle with that every day, you know, make sure that I think this way, is it because I'm being informed by data and -- and I'm being informed by -- by good sound analysis, or am I, you know, leaning this way because of my, you know, inherent bias or inherent perception or preconceived notion of what the system is. Right?  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: And that struggle is -- is, you know, is -- real at all levels. And that's something that we have to be kind of very cognizant of.  Host: Yeah. So when you're thinking about solving these problems with team members, finding a way to think efficiently and making sure that you're considering all of these different things, but not getting too bogged down by these decisions, that -- that's a balance just in and of itself, not just -- not just designing these trajectories and thinking about these systems, but coming to a consensus on how to proceed.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, it's great that we, you know, our branch in particular have had, you know, every, you know, year or so, we get one or two new hires, and we have a bunch of interns that come in. So, it's always great when they come in with fresh perspective. They have not been in the mud, you know, making these trajectories or analysis and things like that. So, they come in and say, “wait, why did you do it that way?” And we go, “yeah, why did we do it that way?” And we need that, right? Because, you know, you don't want to end up in a -- in a kind of an environment in which new people coming in, you know, are conforming, you know, you -- they're expected to conform to whatever standard you have. You want them to come in with a fresh mind, with critical view and to provide us with a different perspective. And that's, I think, the most valuable thing we have, especially here at NASA because of, you know, our notoriety and people want to come to work at NASA and it's a great thing. And we need to keep hiring, we need to keep these people coming in and young minds and -- and really get them engaged, not just in school, but you know, before. So, I think a lot of the public outreach things that we do is extremely important. I think NASA is still one of the most sought-after thing. People say, oh, you work in NASA? That's amazing. And -- and it is. You know, I'm thrilled to go to work every day. And -- and we need that kind of enthusiasm, you know, to continue for -- and people coming in are, you know, they're brilliant. And you need to be -- make sure that we are doing the right thing and doing -- doing things that, you know, to make them feel like they're empowered to change the status quo.  Host: Yeah. So thinking about what we've discussed today, thinking about the difficulties of rendezvousing with Mars, and with the different technologies that we're considering, reaching out to those people who want to come work at NASA and -- and fight to innovate and fight to change the way that things are doing, what are -- what is the message that you want to send to them?  Patrick Chai: It's -- you know, it is a very exciting time, right, because -- because we have this whole Moon/Mars enterprise now, the Honors Program is spinning up and we are going to, you know, go to the surface of the Moon to -- to do some very exciting science and with the goal on the horizon of always going to Mars. So, these systems that we are developing and partnering with, you know, industry partners to develop are going to set -- lay the foundation for what we do at Mars, right. And so, it's very important for us to not only do the mission to the Moon, but also be very, very cognizant of that these are laying the stepping stones. So, we need to learn as much as we can, as we do these things, to inform all the things that we're going to be planning on doing when we, you know, build a spacecraft to go Mars, right. And so, I think it's -- it's a very exciting time for NASA.  Host: Well, it's an exciting time. And the future is -- is exciting, because I think every year is just going to be -- is another step closer.  Patrick Chai: Yeah. And -- and, you know, like I said, I think throughout this podcast is it's a challenging problem and it is probably one of the -- one of humanity's greatest challenge, you know, and I think if there's a will we, you know, I don't doubt that we can achieve it. But it is a challenge and -- and we have some of the brightest people on the planet trying to solve it. And, you know, it's a great thing, and it's -- it's something that, you know, I think it's going to be so rewarding for all of humanity. It's one of those, you know, you think about what people talk about, you know, well what does NASA do besides sending people to space? We do these innovations that we have to develop so that we can send people to Mars. They will have a long-lasting effect on our society. And we might not know what that is till years later, but it will. And that's kind of the challenge from a \"PR perspective\", right? You know what, you know, costing X amount of dollars to send people to Mars. So, what does that, you know, we could spend that money here on Earth, but it's like, you don't know what you're going to get out of it. But we know that it's going to be impactful because we have -- we have a track record of -- of all the great things that have spun off from NASA technologies that we've, you know, came out of the lunar program and the space station program. Right? And the Mars program will be an exponential in terms of how challenging it is, right? We're only two and a half miles off the coast of Spain right now. We're going all the way to America, right? And so, they will -- whatever we come up with in terms of solutions and technology advancement will be, I think societal changing.  Host: Yeah. Well, I'm glad you're on the team thinking about this [laughter]. And looking forward to bringing on others to continue it. It's going – it’s been great work. And this has been a fascinating conversation. Patrick, thanks so much for coming on.  Patrick Chai: Thank you very much for having me. Yeah, it's been great.  Host: Awesome.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 182, \"Mars Perseverance Landing.\" I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight, space exploration, and today, landing a rover on Mars. On July 30th, 2020, NASA's Mars Perseverance rover launched atop a ULA Atlas V-541 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force station in Florida. Since then, it's been traveling at more than 50,000 miles per hour cruising towards Mars to make the near 300-million-mile trek through deep space for seven months and land on Jezero Crater on the Red Planet. That journey is nearing its end. On February 18th, 2021, Perseverance will make its way through the Martian atmosphere and enter into what is famously known as the seven minutes of terror. This is the phase of flight called entry, descent, and landing. And for Perseverance and the teams at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, this may be the most critical seven minutes of the flight to the Martian surface. So, here to go into the details on entry, descent, and landing of Perseverance is Chloe Sackier, Entry, Descent, and Landing Communications Systems Engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. So, let's get right into it. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Chloe Sackier, thanks for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast.  Chloe Sackier: Thank you so much for having me.  Host: Hey, we're in the home stretch here. We're coming up on something I think you have been preparing for a very long time. How are you feeling in this moment right now, just being so close to the Perseverance landing?  Chloe Sackier: Very, very excited. A little nervous. I think the nerves, everyone is feeling as we get closer and closer. Right now, at the time of this recording, we are 30 some days away from February 18th, our big day.  Host: That's right. And there's a lot to do just beforehand and then what we're going to dive into today is exactly what this -- what this moment is that we're talking about. The landing. And what's going to go down. I want to give our listeners though a bit of background and kind of just start from the beginning to talk about what this thing is that is landing on Mars and why it's such a big deal. Let's just start there, Chloe, what is the Perseverance lander?  Chloe Sackier: Sure. So, the Perseverance rover is the most capable rover that NASA and JPL have ever built. And are sending to Mars. It's tasked with some really exciting mission objectives. It's searching for signs of ancient life, collecting rock and regolith samples for possible future sample returns. And it's preparing for humans eventually traveling to Mars. The part that I'm most knowledgeable about is that it's landing on Jezero Crater on the Red Planet on the 18th of February 2021. Jezero Crater is the site of an ancient river delta in a lake that used to fill this crater. And additionally, on top of all that exciting science, Perseverance also carries a smaller robotic buddy. A little helicopter named Ingenuity, which will be the very first aircraft to test controlled flight on another planet. So, lots of exciting firsts.  Host: Yeah, absolutely. Now this landing on Jezero Crater, this is -- you said it's a river delta, and that's -- it sounds very interesting. It sounds like that there's a reason that we're going to land in this area. What's so special about Jezero?  Chloe Sackier: Yeah. So, Jezero Crater was identified as a really exciting site that had a lot of scientific potential. Because it is this ancient river delta location. There are all these fascinating and super rich mineral deposits that scientists think might be able to help us answer those questions about seeking signs of ancient life. And also, from an entry, descent, and landing perspective, it's a safe enough site for us to touch the Perseverance rover down at a nice, safe, clean location.  Host: Yeah, right? You don't want a lot of stuff in the way of that landing. And that journey, it sounds like a long ways, right? I think it's like 300 million miles that the journey was from Earth to Mars. And it launched last year, July 30th I believe was the launch date. We kind of pushed it back but we were still within that window. Were you there? Were you there at the launch? Were you able to witness it?  Chloe Sackier: I was, yes. I was fortunate enough to travel to the launch at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Of course, due to the pandemic, the launch wasn't quite the celebratory affair that we were all sort of expecting.  Host: Right, yeah.  Chloe Sackier: Several of us were able to travel safely along so we could watch in a socially distant beach setting, the launch, and listen along and support our friends and colleagues on console as they ensured a successful and safe launch.  Host: So, there's a lot that goes into that, right? There was a lot of prep work to get Perseverance into that rocket, you know, there was, you've already mentioned a few of the objectives of Perseverance. So, there's quite a number of instruments on there. But your role, Chloe, is entry, descent, and landing. So, what have you been up to throughout the whole development of this, the Perseverance rover, what goes into preparing for entry, descent, and landing on Mars?  Chloe Sackier: So, entry, descent, and landing, I think is such a fascinating phase of the mission. Because it's really just a handful of minutes. But it takes years and years and hundreds of thousands of man hours of effort to ensure that those few minutes go safely and smoothly. My personal role on the entry, descent, and landing team is ensuring that our spacecraft is talking to us. I'm the entry, descent, and landing communication systems engineer. So, I care about making sure that the rich set of data that we generate during entry, descent, and landing, or EDL, makes it off of our spacecraft, makes it to our orbiters at Mars. Makes it through the deep space network. And then eventually back to us at JPL so we can reconstruct exactly what is happening during those exciting minutes. We're really invested and interested in knowing exactly what goes on during those minutes. So, we want to wrangle all of the ears that we can on the Earth side and all the ears we can on Mars and have them pointed towards Mars and listening into what the spacecraft is saying to us.  Host: So, what's it saying, Chloe? What do you care about? When you're getting this data, what is meaningful data that's going to help you to be successful for the EDL phase?  Chloe Sackier: Yeah. So, we're really invested in what she's saying in part because we want to know that she's OK, because those seven minutes of terror, as it's often referred to, are really quite scary. And it's easily the most dangerous part of the mission. So, we're invested in just hearing from Perseverance as often as we can during entry, descent, and landing. But we also want to understand what decisions she's making as she's progressing throughout that flight, throughout EDL. So, we care about -- she sends us little bit of telemetry that explain what decision she makes autonomously, and then of course, once she touches down safely, the rover lets us know that it's alright and that EDL went well.  Host: Very cool. So, what has Perseverance been up to so far? We talked about launch last year. Since launch, you know, it was inserted into an orbit -- around the Earth. And then eventually did a trans Mars injection burn to get all the way to that planet. What's happened since then? What has it been doing?  Chloe Sackier: Yeah, so, as you mentioned earlier, it's a nearly 300-million-mile journey to Mars. And at this point, we've traveled nearly 250 million miles. But that seven-month journey is anything but quiet. Engineers at JPL like to keep a close eye on the spacecraft while she's cruising. We do all sorts of things to make sure that she is doing OK and that we're prepared for eventually entry, descent, and landing, and then the following surface operations. So, we keep an eye on the health, we carry out general maintenance, and monitoring, calibrate a lot of subsystems and instruments. We perform some small attitude corrections to make sure that we keep antennas pointed back towards Earth so we can talk to the spacecraft. And then we want to keep our solar panels pointed towards the Sun, so we get power. And then on top of all that, we also do these Trajectory Correction Maneuvers to tweak the flight path and make sure we're headed to the right target. And then of course, we do a lot of instrument check-outs for devices that we specifically care about during EDL. Make sure that everything's ready to turn on.  Host: Now I was looking at some of those course correction maneuvers, and there weren't many on the way to Mars. But from what I saw, they really picked up in the February time frame, like right before landing. So why do you need to make -- at least these more major corrections, or significant milestones, why are they later in the flight?  Chloe Sackier: Yeah, so we have five opportunities plus one back-up and one contingency maneuver to adjust our flight path. And then when those maneuvers occurred, they all sort of have different -- we get something different out of each one. So, the Trajectory Correction Maneuvers that we do earlier on, like a couple of weeks after launch, those help us point the spacecraft towards the general direction of Mars and fine tune the flight path after launch. And sort of help us get rid of any injection errors that might have come from our launch. And then the TCM, the Trajectory Correction Maneuvers in the middle of cruise, like the December-ish timeframe, really helped us fine tune that even more, even more precisely. Then the maneuvers that we do in February, leading up to entry, descent, and landing, are really more targeted. And then also a backup and contingency maneuver that we don't plan to use but are available to us if we need to at the last minute.  Host: It's really about making sure that, that trajectory is right on target. Because you got a tiny little area that you want to hit, right? And that's Jezero Crater. And you have 300 million miles to make the arrow fly exactly where you want to, I guess is the way to think about it.  Chloe Sackier: Yeah. That's absolutely right. And we like to joke around a lot that the spacecraft flies itself, the EDL flies itself, but we have to -- our job leading up to EDL is to make sure that she has all the information about her -- the way that she's coming into the planet. Because that really helps ensure that EDL comes off more successfully.  Host: So, this is not going to be just like a new thing for you guys. I'm sure that the Jet Propulsion Laboratory has put together simulations and programs and run through and tested what you guys believe is going to be the EDL environmental. What's going to happen during those phases of flight. How do you construct those sims, how did they go? Just more about, I guess, practicing for the ultimate entry, descent, and landing phase of this flight.  Chloe Sackier: Yeah. So, we have definitely spent a long time preparing. And as the saying goes, “practice makes perfect.” And we have many different ways that we essential dry run or practice EDL to make sure that we understand everything about the system, and we're prepared for anything that Mars might throw at us. So, like many other people on the EDL team, I'm also a member of the EDL testing team in our mission system test bed, which is essentially, I like to compare it to a car. Because it's this amazingly -- the test bed is an amazingly complex vehicle in its own right. It's basically all the guts and brains of the real-life spacecraft laid out on a table. And you can send commands to it and send it through these different simulated environments. So, in this test bed, we basically get to dry run EDL over and over and over. And ensure that the flight software's interfacing correctly with the hardware, I like to say that we're essentially rehearsing the choreography of EDL and oftentimes in off-nominal situations. To make sure that the flight system is really robust. So, sometimes we might do a simulation with an atmosphere that is different from what our models tell us to expect. Or we'll do a simulation with some important devices not functioning the way we would expect them to. And then we study the response of the flight system to those fault injections.  Host: So, all of this was just making sure that before you sent Perseverance into space for that ultimate landing, that you had the confidence necessary, because you've gone through all of these different simulated environments to make sure that Perseverance, she can stand up to the test. And that's really the goal there was that's why you were doing all of this repetitious, you mentioned over and over and over, all these repetitious sims.  Chloe Sackier: Yeah. And I think the interesting thing that people may not always appreciate about this phase is that there's no way really for us to test this system in an end to end manner on the ground. Because we can't -- on the ground meaning on Earth, here, on this planet. We can't simulate Mars in the exact same way that we're going to be sending the spacecraft through. So, we sort of have to address -- we have to test the whole system in bits and pieces. So, we can test our flight software and flight hardware. We can go through these specific bits of hardware in the system. Like parachute tests. Or like tests specific to the rover. But we can't test it all together in an environment just like what we'll see in February on Mars until we're actually doing the real thing.  Host: Now, this February landing, February 18th. From what I understand, this, you know, I talked about in the beginning, you know, ultimately the launch was July 30th but there was this window. And I guess because of the way orbital mechanics works, February 18th is your day, right? There's no -- circle around and retry, like this is your moment, right?  Chloe Sackier: Yep. There's no go around.  Host: So, it's got to work, right? That's why you do all the -- another reason you do all of the tests is because you really only have one shot. There's no redo, there's no start over, this is it -- is one moment, one shot.  Chloe Sackier: Yes. Yes. That's absolutely right. And like I mentioned earlier, this thing does land itself, but we need to help it. So, we care about, in our final approach phase prior to EDL, we want to get the spacecraft ready for EDL, so we monitor all of these activities that the spacecraft is doing, these reconfigurations and mode transitions and conditioning and turning everything on. We want to make sure we get to the right place to start EDL at the right time so that we're really on target and we make sure that our entry guidance that's run inside the spacecraft's computers, we're not stressing it too much and it's able to do the job that we're asking it. And then we also want to tell the spacecraft what it needs to know. So, when I mentioned all those Trajectory Correction Maneuvers, and these parameter updates that we're doing in these last few weeks, that's what we're doing and really preparing the spacecraft to hit that exact point, that exact location at that exact point in time.  Host: So, I want to get a picture of just what's flying through space right now. Because we all saw the launch, but it was this rocket, you know, and there was a shell on top of it. So, we couldn't see kind of the construction of what this things looks like flying through space. Give us a picture of what it looks like in the cruise phase right now.  Chloe Sackier: Sure. So, there's the Perseverance and tiny little Ingenuity hanging on underneath. The rover is wrapped up in the heat shield in the descent stage in the back shell. And that, all of those critical pieces right there are essentially the main players in EDL. So, the heat shield will protect us during entry. The back shell is what we deploy our parachute from. And that's sort of behind the rover. And then the descent stages is what flies us to our actual -- it's sort of like our rover jetpack. So, all of that is packaged up and held by the cruise stage, which is the vehicle that takes us all the way to Mars. It has all of the fuel tanks and the radio equipment and antennas and everything. And that cruise stage takes us all the way until just ten minutes before entry. And then at that point, we separate from the cruise stage.  Host: You guys have got a cool website where you can kind of see, it's like a map of where this is. This whole setup that you're talking about, where it is in space and how fast it's going. And last time I looked, it was traveling at 50,000 miles per hour. Is that how fast it's going to get 300 million miles away?  Chloe Sackier: Yes, yes, 50,000 miles per hour. Quite a speeding ticket.  Host: Yeah. [Laughter]  Chloe Sackier: Well it's got a long ways to go, so we have no time to waste. [Laughter]  Host: Well, Chloe, let's go into the entry, descent, and landing phase. This is the seven minutes of terror as you called it. What -- I'm curious to hear why it is called that. But let's go through step by step this, you know, what's going to happen as it gets closer to Mars and gets into this phase?  Chloe Sackier: Sure. So, as I mentioned just before we separate from our cruise stage, that vehicle that safely escorted us all the way to Mars, about ten minutes before entry, and then at entry, we hit the atmosphere of Mars. We use the atmosphere of Mars to start slowing down. It's thinner than the atmosphere of Earth. So, we can't slow down completely using it. But there's enough atmosphere there that it does help us bleed off a little bit of velocity. And during that time, we're protected by that heat shield. About 80 seconds after entry, we hit a period called peak heating. At that point, the temperature on the outside of the heat shield is around 2,300 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1,300 degrees Celsius. Really, really hot. And during that time, while we're doing entry, we're steering towards our target using this principle called guided entry, that was essentially adapted from the Apollo era. And this approach helps us stay on target while we might be hitting pockets of air that would maybe bump us around a little bit. While we're on that heat shield, we slow down to just under 1,000 miles per hour. And then at that point, we deploy the largest supersonic planetary parachute that has ever been used. It's about 70 and a half feet or 21 and a half meters in diameter. And we deploy it at about mock 1.75. Also, really, really fast. At that point, we're about seven miles high in altitude and going 940 miles per hour. And then shortly after that, we jettison our heat shield at about mock 0.7. This uncovers the radar that we use to start searching for the ground. And this is where the Terrain Relative Navigation concept takes the stage. And starts searching for the ground. We use this concept, TRN, to take pictures of where we are and match those pictures up to an onboard map. So it's sort of like an -- like if you're driving in your car and you use a GPS instead of just looking out the window, you see pictures of where you are and you match those up to your map to help you figure out and localize yourself. So then around this point, we drop out, our descent stage, that rover jetpack, drops out of the back shell. Because we don't want to recontact that back shell and parachute. We execute a divert maneuver to quickly get out of the way. At this point, we're just under 7000 feet above the surface. And then while we're at that descent stage, that takes us down to a velocity of I think .75 meters per second. So, way, way slower than we've been traveling before. And when we're traveling this fast, we're about 20 meters off the ground. And then at this point, we execute the sky crane maneuver. So, this is what was originally debuted on the Curiosity rover. Separates the rover from the descent stage, from that rocket jetpack, and touches Perseverance down safely and slowly on her wheels. And then as soon as we have confirmation of -- as soon as the rover has confirmed that she's touched down, we separate the descent stage connection and fly the descent stage away to a safe distance. And that's all there is to it. We're on Mars.  Host: All there is to it. But when you think about it, all of that, everything you just described happens in seven minutes. And the challenge there is, I think, one of the challenges at least, there's a lot of challenges, you just went over a lot of them. But one of them is, like you said, this is all happening by itself. Because Mars is so far away that by the time it actually communicates what's happening to you on Earth, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, real time on Mars, it has already happened because of the communication delay, right?  Chloe Sackier: Yes, that's true. Our one-way light time at this point in the mission is over 11 minutes. So, it takes 11 minutes for information to travel from Mars back to us at Earth. And because of that massive distance and massive delay, we can't joystick the rover through landing. We can't fly it ourselves. It has to happen completely autonomously.  Host: That's incredible. Chloe, I want to go through and kind of ask questions about every phase of this flight from beginning to end. We did actually have a subtle dropout. You were talking about, you talked about slowing down and entering into the atmosphere. We kind of missed that part of it. But I think the question about that phase was how do we get down from 50,000 miles an hour to the 10,000 miles an hour? Is that what you said? Was it 10,000 miles an hour when you actually hit the atmosphere?  Chloe Sackier: Yeah. So, it's a little complicated, orbital mechanics wise. But basically, in cruise, we are traveling 50,000 miles per hour relative to the Sun. But then once we actually hit the atmosphere for entry, at that point, we're going about 12,000 miles per hour, a little over 12,000 miles per hour.  Host: OK. So, it's not really slowing down, it's just kind of relative to how fast Mars is traveling or something like that?  Chloe Sackier: Yeah, that's true. The 50,000 is relative to the position of the Sun and then when we hit atmosphere, that 12,000 number, that's relative to Mars.  Host: Got it.  Chloe Sackier: But we do use the atmosphere to slow down significantly before we deploy our heat shield. We bleed off a lot of velocity.  Host: Right, it goes from 10,000 to 1,000 miles an hour, right?  Chloe Sackier: We deploy our parachute -- yeah. Just about around 1,000 miles an hour. A little under.  Host: Now -- I got it. You were talking about some, you know, some of the sims you were running. And these parachutes, you're deploying them at supersonic speeds, right? I mean I feel like if you were to deploy anything at that speed it would just kind of snap. So how does that work, you know? How does a supersonic -- how are you able to deploy a supersonic parachute that's able to, you know, perform that job and not snap?  Chloe Sackier: Carefully. Yeah, no, that's true. It's a blistering high speed. And to have a soft goods material that's capable of withstanding that, we basically built a really, really strong parachute. And test it in all of these different stressing conditions. So, we -- when I mentioned earlier about testing EDL in bits and pieces, the parachute is obviously this critical component, this sort of quarterback of the team that our safe EDL is dependent and reliant on. So, we test our parachute in big wind tunnels. We do sounding rocket tests to simulate what that supersonic deployment might look like and feel like to the parachute. And then all sorts of lower level tests as well.  Host: So, what's challenging, you talked about the heat shield heating up to I think it was 1300 degrees. You have supersonic parachutes that are deploying here. What are the challenges here with just Mars being the planet that it is? It's got an atmosphere, so you have to deal with that atmosphere, so you have to have a heat shield. But you don't have enough, you know, a thick enough atmosphere where parachutes aren't going to do the whole, you know, as much as they do on Earth, for any missions that we have. We deploy parachutes and they land safely, either on land and water. What are some of the challenges here with just dealing with Mars?  Chloe Sackier: Yeah, so as you mentioned, there's the common expression is that there's not fear to really use it enough to ever break to the point where we've, you know, have slowed down enough. But there's just enough atmosphere that you have to pay attention to it and take it into consideration. There's all of these, you know, it's always fascinating to learn about Mars' weather and to even think about what weather looks like on another planet. But Mars is a planet, just like our own. It has weather, it has winds, it has dust storms, all of these components that we have to study and understand a little bit about so we can plan how they might impact us and affect us. There's the parachute, we already discussed the excitement of the parachute. When we get to the stage where we have jettisoned our heat shield and we're using our radar to search for the ground, that's a really fascinating point in the mission as well because we -- we're looking to land in Jezero Crater, which is this scientifically exciting location. But also, from an entry, descent, and landing perspective, we need a landing site that is safe enough to touch down. So, the things that we're looking for is an altitude of the landing site that's not too high, it gives us enough time to stop. And not too dangerous to land on. So, not completely full of sand dunes or rocks or slopes or really rough terrain. We want it to be radar reflective to a certain extent. And that the atmospheric conditions, like I mentioned, are OK. Not too dusty, not too windy. So, Jezero Crater's really this interesting spot. Because it's, from a terrain perspective, most exciting that we've ever attempted a landing on for EDL. But we want to get there for the science. And our new -- new technological functionality of TRN allows us to travel to that little bit more rocky, little bit more sandy crater that we care about visiting.  Host: Well let's go into that. Let's go into Terrain Relative Navigation. This is a critical technology that was put on Perseverance. What is this technology?  Chloe Sackier: Yes. So, Terrain Relative Navigation, quite simply put, it gives us eyes. So instead of just taking pictures, on the way down, we're taking those pictures and matching them up to a map that is onboard the spacecraft, like I mentioned earlier, just like you or I could look out the window while we're driving our car, and match up landmarks or things that we're seeing to a map. So TRN helps Perseverance figure out where it is and once the spacecraft knows where it is, it can use its engines to fly to a safe landing spot that it picks and decides upon. So, we, the humans behind the scenes, have done the work over the last few years to map out and really understand every little nook and cranny of this landing site. And identify, using some fascinating algorithms and sometimes just our eyes, the spots that we think are safe to land in and the spots that we don't want Perseverance to choose. And then we give all of that information to the spacecraft in the form of that onboard map, and then while she's flying EDL, she takes those pictures, checks those pictures, and where she thinks she is against at onboard map and says, “OK, this is where I want to fly, this is safe, I'm going to turn on my engines and lean over and fly that way.”  Host: So those engines, are they, are they in the back shell and they're just kind of little pulses to guide it the right way?  Chloe Sackier: We have a bunch of different engines in different places. There are -- there's the thrusters that we use to sort of reorient ourselves as we're coming in for entry. But the descent stage is what flies us to the safe landing spot that we pick.  Host: Now what's interesting, this is what I read, that Terrain Relative Navigation jumps up the chance of successful landing exactly where you want it from 80% or 85% to about 99%. So, that's how good this technology is at guiding down based on all the sims that you've done and used it with?  Chloe Sackier: Yeah. It's really incredible. As I mentioned earlier, what we're looking for in a safe landing site for EDL, slopes, craters, rocks, none of those things we really like. Those all really equate to landing death for EDL. But they're so interesting. They're massive science targets for the scientists. And at the end of the day, that's why we're doing this mission. We want to enable some really, really exciting science. And so, Curiosity and all the previous Mars missions had to ensure that anywhere that we could possibly touchdown was basically a parking lot. No sand dunes, nothing like that. But we don't have to do that with Perseverance, mostly in part due to Terrain Relative Navigation. There can be and will be rocks and slopes and craters in Jezero, Jezero Crater. Actually, the middle of the landing eclipse is a cliff base that's like 60 to 80 meters tall right on the edge of the river delta. So, it's -- I feel like if you were standing in the middle of Jezero Crater and looking around, it would be quite, quite beautiful but it’s exciting and a little more risky than has previously been attempted. But all of that is enabled because of the TRN technology.  Host: So, Chloe, I believe like me, and I'm sure thousands if not millions of others, are going to be glued to the TV trying to watch everything go down. What are we going to see? Are we going to get -- are we going to be able to see some of the things that Perseverance is seeing? Like the Terrain Relative Navigation providing a video feed. Are we going to be looking at the control room? What are we going to see?  Chloe Sackier: So, yes, so me and my whole team will be at JPL monitoring telemetry and anxiously awaiting with the rest of the world hearing confirmation that Perseverance has touched down safely. And we'll be doing our best to share everything that she's telling us with the world in real time as that's happening. We have multiple different ways of relaying the rich dataset that the spacecraft generates during EDL back to us on Earth during that timeframe. We have tones of the X band that are sent directly to Earth. I like to say it's sort of like the spacecraft singing us a little song as she flies EDL. So, these tones, each tone indicates a different critical event has happened. So, we might get a tone for the deployment of the parachute. Or a tone indicating that we just completed a bank reversal. These tones just sort of provide markers of events that the spacecraft has checked off. We also get a tone, a pretty persistent tone all the way throughout EDL that we call the heartbeat tone. And that's basically just the spacecraft giving us a thumbs up from Mars and saying like “yep, I'm still alive, I'm still trucking.” So, we love to see that intermittently and make sure that everything is OK. We also receive -- the spacecraft communicates UHF data to our orbiters, to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiters, and the [Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission] MAVEN spacecraft during EDL. And those orbiters are at Mars. And those orbiters relay that information to the deep space network, which has stations in California and Spain and Australia. So, all over the world. And those stations relay that data back to us at JPL. And the dataset we get from the orbiters is a little bit richer than what the tones indicate. So, it tells us a bit more information about the decisions that the spacecraft is making and the environment that it's experiencing throughout EDL.  Host: And so, you will be in that control room during the EDL phase. And you've mentioned it before but make sure -- correct me if I'm summarizing this incorrectly, is your job is to make sure all of these connections, this pathway of how Perseverance is communicating to you guys in that control room, that those pathways are all functioning normally and properly and you're getting all the data you need?  Chloe Sackier: Yes. That's exactly correct. I think the most fascinating thing about the communications and the telemetry side of the world is just like it is in EDL, it takes so much effort, so much orchestration and conducting of so many people and so many teams for such a small number of minutes to go off smoothly and successfully. So, everything has to go right. Nothing can go wrong for one bit of data to make it -- the spacecraft computer out of the spacecraft antenna, be received by the Mars orbiters, make it from the orbiters back to the dishes of the deep space network, and then all the way back to our computer monitors at JPL. So, there's not a lot of room for errors. It's very exciting.  Host: Well, you know, I think you've kind of mentioned this throughout our conversation today. But you've referred to Perseverance as she. And I think -- you know, correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like, you know, because of that pressure, because of all of the -- all of your work going towards this one moment, you all in your own kind of special way have developed a connection to the rover. And in a way of kind of personifying it and making it into some kind -- instead of just a piece of hardware, something that you as a team can connect with and really engage with throughout this critical moment.  Chloe Sackier: Yeah. I think that's fair. There's definitely a significant amount of personification going on. But I've heard teammates refer to this spacecraft as like their baby or their child. Some people think of it as an old friend. Or maybe a dog. But everyone relates to it in a different way. But it goes without saying that it is incredibly meaningful to every scientist and engineer who's gotten the amazing opportunity to work on this project. So, it's, you know, it manifests itself in different ways.  Host: So, you came to JPL after Curiosity, that's correct?  Chloe Sackier: That's correct, yes. Actually, I remember watching the Curiosity, the entry, descent, and landing in my bedroom, in high school. And thinking like “wow, those people are really cool. I wonder how I figure out how to do what they're doing.”  Host: I watched it too. I was watching it during an internship, and I watched it live. And I'll remember, you know, one of the highlights of the whole thing was, you know, you were just watching, you were just watching the control room and all these faces just glued to their monitors. And of course, the big moment that I think everybody that watched that live remembers was the celebration. Jumping up and down, the high fives. That's something that you get to be a part of now.  Chloe Sackier: It will of course, look a little different than the jubilant celebrations of the past, and what the celebrations in mission control looked like for Curiosity due to the pandemic. So, you know, our first and foremost priority is to keep each other safe. So, it's heartbreaking, but no hugs this time. We'll have to make do with elbow bumps. But that certainly, doesn't diminish the incredible feeling of successfully landing something on Mars. And the pure joy and disbelief I think we'll all feel accompanying that.  Host: Well you did -- I'm sure you did get to learn a lot from the folks who have been a part of that moment before, during Curiosity, right? I mean, the landing looks very, very familiar to Curiosity. So, you have a lot of folks who worked hard on that. And that you learned from. And I'm sure, I'm sure you got to learn from, you know, what to do differently this time around, what to make sure we do consistently that was successful on Curiosity. I'm sure you got to hear a lot of those stories.  Chloe Sackier: Oh, yes, absolutely. I think that's easily the best part of the job is the people that we get to work with. And some of these people have been doing it not just since Curiosity, but decades ago. So, they've been involved with so many successful missions. Their stories are unparalleled. Their wisdom is infinite. Knows no bounds. So, there's a lot of important technical knowledge that gets passed along throughout the generations. But also, just like ways of doing things that you know, you can really only learn firsthand.  Host: Yeah. So, Chloe, what's -- we're recording this, like you said, you know, just about a month ahead of the actual scheduled landing. So, what's on your agenda from now until landing day on the 18th?  Chloe Sackier: Right now, as we are recording, we are in the middle of our final operational readiness test, which we also call our EDL dress rehearsal. Up until this point, we've been, as we talked about, simulating and practicing on the spacecraft all sorts of different situations and scenarios. But now, we're at the point in the mission where we have to train ourselves. We have to train the team to make sure that we are ready to deal with any sort of situation we might encounter. So, we're stepping through all the motions of those final few days before EDL. So, getting the spacecraft ready for EDL, getting to the right place to start at the right time. Telling the spacecraft what it needs to know. So that's that process of Trajectory Correction Maneuvers and parameter dates. And that cyclical sort of undertaking. And then of course, in a few weeks, we won't be practicing anymore, we'll be doing that process for real.  Host: There you go. Now you're going to have your celebratory, you know, elbow bumps as you mentioned. Socially distant celebration. I'm curious, what's your role after -- you know, you've been working up to this moment, right? Entry, descent, and landing. What's your role after EDL?  Chloe Sackier: We go through a process where we try and make sure we understood exactly everything that happened. And piece together the whole story. This helps us prepare and understand things better for future missions and really understand how our technology works. So, we'll be piecing together all those little bits of telemetry and really trying to make sure we flush out every single detail. And then of course, the science will kick off on Perseverance. And the rover will start firing up all those instruments and turning out the mission to search for signs of past life.  Host: A really important thing. Now, Chloe, this is, it's been a whole lot of work for you. And I know, I can sense your excitement through for getting ready for this moment. You know, kind of, let us in on some of the culture. Some of the, you know, not necessarily secrets, but just the behind the scenes of just working at JPL, you know, working with the teams that are working on this rover. And just the culture that you have there to put together a mission like this.  Chloe Sackier: Yeah. I think it's an amazing culture. There's an expression at JPL that we \"Dare mighty things.\" And I think to accompany that sort of mission philosophy, you have to have a tight knit culture. And a group of people that are really supportive, but also really push each other to do our best and put forth our best ideas. It's a little cliché to say, but I truly feel like the EDL team itself is so much more than just a team. It's a family in every sense of the word. It's a group of very interesting, very diverse, very wonderfully weird people. But I feel like we all complement each other so well. Of course, in the pre-pandemic days, we used to get up to all sorts of hijinks. We had goat yoga and axe throwing and laser tag. I remember one holiday season, we all acquired NERF guns for some reason and then there was a solid two or three weeks where we were just chasing each other in circles around our floor, our cubicle area. And being very productive. [Laughter] But it's a very tight-knit team. It's been the honor of a lifetime to work with them and learn from these incredibly accomplished people.  Host: Yeah. I think you need that, right? Because you're working so hard on something so complicated. And to have -- and to have that kind of culture that brings you all together to make sure you're getting the job done I think is a wonderful thing.  Chloe Sackier: Exactly. You have so many late nights in the test bed. It really helps to actually like the people that you're working with. It makes a difference.  Host: Well, Chloe, from here at the Johnson Space Center, we're going to be watching intently for the landing itself. We'll be rooting for you and of course for Perseverance and all the great science that it's going to do after this critical seven minutes of terror, the entry, descent, and landing phase. Looking forward to everything we're going to be learning when that rover actually starts doing its mission. Chloe Sackier, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast. And describing in detail all the wonderful things that we get to look forward to. I know I feel prepped and ready and know what to expect for when I'm watching the real deal live on the 18th. So, best of luck to you and of course to your team.  Chloe Sackier: Thank you so much. It's been really fun hanging out.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. I really hope you enjoyed this conversation with Chloe Sackier on what's going to happen during the entry, descent, and landing phase of Perseverance's journey to the Martian surface. Now, we are doing this podcast specifically on EDL for Perseverance. In fact, you can check out another one of our episodes, 174, we -- that one's called \"Sticking the Landing on Mars.\" We talked with some experts about what happens when you add the human element to landing on Mars. But we are just one episode of many through all of the different NASA podcasts we have across the agency. Check out some of their episodes as well. We've got “Curious Universe,” we got “Gravity Assist,” and they're going to be talking about different elements of the -- of Perseverance, some of the science, and some of the sounds, some interesting parts of the mission. This is EDL. So, make sure you check out some of those podcasts. You can go to NASA.gov/podcasts to check out any of those episodes. If you're curious about the Perseverance rover itself or want to learn more about Mars or its objectives, there's a good website for that. Mars.NASA.gov.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host):  Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 58, Isolation.  This is Part Two of our five-part series on the hazards of human space flight.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  On this podcast we bring in the experts, NASA Scientists, Engineers, and Astronauts, all to let you know the coolest information about what's going on right here at NASA.  So today we consider another hazard of human space flight, isolation and confinement.  We're talking with Tom Williams, Element Scientist for the Human Factors and Behavioral Performance in the Human Research Program.  He focuses on areas like habitability and behavioral health and performance risks to space flight in addition to many other areas.  He leads a research team that looks into the hazards of human space flight including isolation.  So with no further delay, let's go lightspeed and jump right ahead to our talk with Dr. Tom Williams.  Enjoy.     [ Music ]    Host: Okay, Tom.  Thank you for coming here today to talk about the second of our five hazards.  This one's on isolation.  I appreciate your coming on.    Dr. Tom Williams: Very glad to be here.  Thank you.    Host: So this one, this one's interesting.  And this one is a lot of -- when I think of isolation I think of a lot of songs, you know, like David Bowie.  You think of Space Odyssey , right?  Out there alone in the universe.  What am I doing?  But this is an interesting -- it's an interesting concept because I don't know if there's any place on Earth where you can be potentially as far away from Earth as you are with exploration and space travel.  It's a huge consideration.  So just sort of going through the isolation.  What is isolation and what have -- what do we know so far about what isolation does to the human body?  What do we know?    Dr. Tom Williams: Yeah.  So when we think of isolation, it's probably important to think about what in essence it does to us as human beings because we're very adaptive organisms.  I mean we're very resistant and adaptable to different changes in our environment.  And what isolation does is sort of remove that context of adaption because, when we're isolated, we're not being able to engage our environment in as many different ways as we are when we're not isolated.  And so, therefore, some of the things that we depend on to help us adapt to the different challenges that we may encounter are now removed from that.  So it sort of creates that barrier to allow us to kind of be that adaptive resilient human being that we know we can be.  So it's good to think of isolation as sort of three different areas.  There's a social disconnection because when you're isolated you're not around other people.  It also challenges our ability to self-regulate because we typically learn to respond to our environment by the manner in which other people may react to us.   And so there's an important component to that.  And then long-term, our mental representations of how we interact with our environment are often determined by how well we feel we're being successful in interacting with our environment.  So in an isolated environment, you're in a monotonous area, in an area, an environment that doesn't give us kind of that challenge and that feedback on how things are different each day and how we get to adapt to those differences.    Host: Yeah.  So there's no room for correction because nothing is correcting you.  So you're [inaudible], you can sort of spiral into any direction, really, without any sort of guidance.    Dr. Tom Williams: Yeah, it's a great point because oftentimes we like to think about the fact that, well, we wish we had less demand in our environment, but then when you get less demand in your environment it's not as interesting and we don't get to basically see how far we can go with some of the demands and challenges that we have in life.  And if you think about what we ask a crew -- we tend to look for really high-achieving, high-performing individuals who are used to taking on significant challenge, and then you put him in an isolated and confined environment where there's fewer demands placed on them.  They may be more extreme, but fewer demands over time in a long-duration mission, for example.    Host: So it kind of sounds like these fewer demands are almost kind of leading you -- if I'm in an isolated environment, it almost would want me to -- it's almost like I'm bored, right?  And so there's not as much demand on me, not as much feedback, so because I'm not getting that response, I create a more maybe exciting environment.  Maybe that's why the behavior -- is that a reason for it?  Has there been studies on that?    Dr. Tom Williams: Well, you know, when you look at some of those social deprivation, kind of the sensory deprivation experiments that were done in the '60s where they put individuals in a completely isolated chamber, removing all sensory stimulation.  So they're in a tank of water, no light, no sound, and people can't last in that environment very long.  And they started to have vivid imaginations, vivid like almost hallucinations.  The mind wants to be engaged.  The mind wants to be experiencing different stimuli, so it is important to keep that constant interplay between what's inside us and what's going on outside us, and to get feedback on how effective we're being.  And so I think that's part of that consideration for how do we make sure that we keep crew focused, engaged in meaningful and relevant activities so that they feel as though they're being successful on a long-duration mission where there may be fewer things to do.    Host: So is that some of the results that come from these studies in the '60s?  You realize that there needs to be some sort of stimulus, so you give them activities to do, but they have to be maybe a kind of specific activity to make sure that they are stimulated.    Dr. Tom Williams: Yeah.  One of the things we saw -- Shannon Lucid, when she was on Mir Station, one of the things she emphasized was the need to stay engaged in something that you enjoy doing because you would have periods of time.  So one of the things she did that was really fascinating is she took 100 books with her to read to her children.  So she recorded these books.  Now the problem, of course, on a long-duration mission, we may not be able to have the -- can't afford the weight that would be required to take large numbers of books.    Host: Right.    Dr. Tom Williams: We'd have to do it electronically or something of that nature.  But that shows you where she was proactively thinking ahead about if you're going to have periods of time where you're not going to have something to do, really high-achieving, engaged people will find something.  And so being planful about those type of demands helps you be prepared for it.    Host: See, in that instance, you have to be engaged, but not just with yourself.  It sounds like she was connecting to the ground.  She was down-looking to the ground to connect with another person.  So she's planning ahead, not just to stimulate herself, but to connect, to be with other people, and to have that sort of communication.    Dr. Tom Williams: Exactly.  Exactly.  And that's an important observation because that's what we need to characterize and understand.  And we know on station today, crew can, when they have time, and they're kept very busy on the station obviously every day with Sundays they attempted to give them off-time.    Host: Right.    Dr. Tom Williams: But they can do a connection straight down to their family on a voice-over-internet telephone, satellite phone, and so they can facetime as well.  So that's an important connection.  What we have to think about is how will that differ?  What impact will that have when there's a time delay --    Host: Oh, yeah.    Dr. Tom Williams: -- and you can't have that instantaneous feedback, that social connection that we know is important for human being.    Host: Yeah.  Definitely, once you go farther away from Earth, it's going to be harder to communicate.  So I want to jump away for just a few minutes to share this clip from my talk with Dr. Mike Barratt, a space traveler himself, and a medical doctor who has had experience with communicating with Earth from space, but reflected on continuing communication out into deep space.    Host:  Well, we'll start with this.  We'll start with -- is there a certain level of communication that's needed to maintain the crew's health and feeling like they're still connected and not so far away from Earth?    Mike Barratt:   I think that as we move towards exploration of deep space we have to actually look backward, not forward, for the answers to some of these problems.  Now, if you were to look at what I consider one of the greatest voyages of discovery of all time, Captain Cook's circumnavigation aboard Endeavor, where they were lucky to find a merchant ship or a whale ship that might be going to their home port maybe years into their voyage.  The crew would draft some letters, hand that to them, and hope that the ship would make it there safely sometime in the next year.  And that's -- that letter-writing campaign was kind of how things were done.  If you were to tell them, hey, look, we got a system where, given a few minutes to several hours, you can get a message back to Greenwich and then they can communicate with you before the day is out, they wouldn't have believed you.  So, basically, what we have is a revolutionary capability compared to the means that supported exploration missions for centuries.   And so, can we do it?  If course.  We have.  We can do that.  Now we have to crew and we have to design accordingly, and really move towards more mission autonomy.  And we've spoiled ourselves in a way by having such broad bandwidth and real-time communication for the station.  But the station is a laboratory, and it is designed to produce as much science as possible, and that really depends on real-time communication.  Whereas heading to Mars and some of the other deep space destinations, we're not in that paradigm.  We are really all about exploring and what we need to do in maintaining the ship and maintaining the crew and supporting the mission.  Most of the responsibility has to really be given to the crew.    Host: And that's a big one, right?  The Space Station -- there's -- it's pretty close to no delay whenever you're talking, and that's why you can have back-and-forth real-time communication with the ground.  But as you go further out into space, now that signal is taking extra time to travel back and from Earth and Mars.  Depending on where the Mars and Earth are positioned in the solar system, it can be up to a 40-minute roundtrip, right?  Twenty minutes out, 20 minutes back.    Dr. Tom Williams: Right.    Host: So are we planning for that?  Are we making sure that communication, even if it is delayed, is a regular part of living on another planet?    Dr. Tom Williams: We are.  And part of what we're looking at is more autonomous systems that allow for the individual to be able to carry out the activities without the constant interplay between Mission Control and ground on getting feedback.  So some of the things that starts to help us anticipate is if there are training requirements that - do we need to train crew differently if there's no Mission Control that they can reach back to to make the procedure they're about to engage in is the right sequence of procedures.  So part of our research program looks at how do we make sure that procedures are sequenced in the right way to ensure that they're efficient and effective so that we don't add stress in that way.  Another thing that we're looking at is, how do we determine if your schedule needs to be changed?  So now the crew schedule with slight modifications by them is basically handled by ground, so Mission Control will determine what the schedule will be for the day.   On an autonomous mission, more autonomous, where there's less interplay, how will the crew determine if they want to change their schedule and what might that schedule change -- what's the impact of that over time?  So maybe they don't want to do something at that particular time that it was scheduled, and they put that off.  Well, what's the impact of putting that off and how does it then alter other sequence activities that would need to follow?    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Tom Williams: And those are important things we want to look at.    Host: Because if they get -- if they put it off, they're not going to get feedback that says hey, don't put that off for, you know, it depends, up to 20 minutes.  Somebody recognizes that they're getting -- or maybe 20/40 minutes -- recognizes that they're putting it off.  Hey, you weren't supposed to do that.  But by the time they get the feedback it's already gone.    Dr. Tom Williams: Right.    Host: So that's where that level of autonomy comes from.  So -- and that's part of regular life on station, too, right, is having that feedback.  Is -- I know the astronauts are so busy just day to day.  I mean, they have scientific experiments that they're running constantly throughout the day.  They got to maintain the Space Station, too.  So if something breaks, they got to fix it.  And then on top of that, they have to work out.  Is a lot of these tasks -- I mean, is there anything in addition to that to make sure that they are receiving this sort of stimulus and making sure that they don't feel isolated?  Where does isolation come into their day to day?    Dr. Tom Williams: I'd say the isolation is more -- because there's great social cohesiveness that exists on station among the crew.    Host: Right.    Dr. Tom Williams: So with the number that they tend to have there, there is that sense of connection with the crew.  And that strengthens over time.  But what's interesting is you'll -- you sometimes will note that crew, as the mission goes on, will tend to spend more time taking pictures and looking at Earth through the cupola.  So do we infer from that that they're missing that social connection on Earth, because one of the things we see when crew come back is sort of an increase and a sense of universalism, so they have an expanded view of the world, and part of that is probably because they've been able to see it from a distance as opposed to just on Earth as we all see it.  And the other thing that we can conjecture on that is that if they're looking more at Earth, is it because they're getting closer to their mission ending?  Or is it because they miss the people on Earth more as time goes on?   And so part of that psychological connection is part of what we need to understand as we look at some of our high fidelity analogs to make a determination what are the processes that are causing the changes in behavior.  And we had one, for example, one study that we looked at, the results of -- from -- that was run in Russia, the Mars 520.  And one of the things that was noted in the six crew members in that analog was that there seemed to be an increase in what we might call psychological [inaudible], so their energy levels were less as time went on.  So near the end of the mission they were less active, and was that less activeness as a result of being disconnected from the outside world more, was it a function of having less stimulation from their environment?  And those are things that when we see these results then we need to ensure that we characterize them appropriately to see was this a function of the individuals within that analog, or does it generalize out to potentially our crew, and then we need to better understand that.    Host: I know, I know.  Why are you cutting away from the conversation, Gary?  This is the last one, I promise.  But who better to comment on do you feel isolated than an astronaut himself.  Here's Mike Barratt once again.    Host:  Did you ever feel isolated on a Space Station or maybe because it's so close that maybe you felt pretty connected?    Mike Barratt:    I think that the only times I ever felt isolated up there was when I knew there were events going on on the ground that I really wanted to be a part of.  Mostly family events.  Other than that, not really, for two reasons.  You know, number one, all those habitability factors that I mentioned.    Host: Yeah.    Mike Barratt:    But number two, where you are is just so magical.  I mean, it captivates you.  You are mostly feeling how amazing it is to be where you are and feel what you're feeling and see what you're seeing than you are wishing that you were elsewhere.    Host: So I'm guessing there's a lot of studies, really, or maybe a few, at least, that are looking at behavioral changes on long-duration missions because that's what we're doing now.  Crews that are going to the Space Station are up there for up to six months.  So are you already looking at behavioral changes, especially in performance and how well and how efficiently they're doing their tasks, from beginning to the end of the mission?    Dr. Tom Williams: We are indeed.  We have a number of different analogs that we look at.  In fact, we just had the human exploration research analog, the HERA Mission that just ended this past Monday night.    Host: Oh, that's right.    Dr. Tom Williams: And we've had crew in there for 45 days, and what we look at, across that 45 days -- of course we do a baseline -- but then across the 45 days we're looking at potential changes in cognitive processing.  So we have them engage in a number of tasks that are space-flight-relevant.  But we're also assessing using a cognition battery that was developed specifically for astronauts because of the different impacts that we think space may have, space flight may have on the cognitive processing.  So we're looking at that across time.  We're looking at their team interactions across time, how that may change their cohesiveness, their sense of cooperation and collaboration with one another, and we're looking at how they eat, how they sleep, and with the crew that we just finished with, we also had them on a sleep-restricted schedule to determine what was the impact of that, and there are a number of different factors that we look at and then we consolidate that information, recognizing we brought four people in to do a task.   What is the impact when we give them structured tasks to do and then how does that change the way they relate to one another, the way that their mind and body starts to adapt to this demand?  And then we'll use that to generalize to what do we need to prepare for countermeasures for any of those factors that we think are impacting them.    Host: HERA is very interesting because it's just this habitat really that simulates like this is probably sort of what a Mars habitat, a lunar habitat, whatever, and other planetary habitat would look like.  And it's just living and working in this habitat.  But the reason you're doing it is exactly what you're saying, it's to study these behavioral changes.  You do these tasks and see how they react to that.  Obviously, you know, astronauts are going to be there and they're going to be working hard just like they do on the Space Station.  But whenever -- there's going to be times, there's going to be times where they're going to have so much work that they're going to be sleep-deprived.  So exactly what happens to that?  Is there comparisons we can draw?  Do you see a lot of the same things happening with the workload and the behavioral changes on the station and in HERA?  Is there a lot of crossover there?    Dr. Tom Williams: You know we've had some great researchers, Chuck Czeisler and Laura Barger and then Erin Flynn-Evans of our own NASA Ames Research Center that have looked at using actigraphy which is an indirect measure of sleep.  So when we sleep we tend to not be moving around, hopefully.  And so the actigraphy device measures how much activity the individual is engaged in, and then from that we infer the person is sleeping or not.  And in one study that they looked at in 21 crew, they found that about 29% of the time crew aren't sleeping well.  Their circadian rhythm has been dysregulated.    Host: Wow.    Dr. Tom Williams: And that can be due to a slam shift, for example.  There was a docking with a resupply vehicle or a Soyuz craft that comes in in the middle of the night where they normally would have been sleeping which then, because of the schedule, they're don't really get to catch up on their sleep.  They can't sleep in the next day because of activities or requirements.  And so -- and the research tells us that it takes about 13 hours of sleep to sort of recover after your circadian has been dysregulated, so you'll need to get extra sleep.  But we tend to see that, although it's very individual, crew will tend to average about six hours of sleep at night on station.  Now we know that's not what they need because when we measure the sleep before they go up and when they come back, they're averaging about seven hours of sleep.  So it could be a function of high workload.  It could be a function of just circadian dysregulation because of the 16 sunrises and sunsets that they observe each day.   And for here on Earth, our sleep cycle and our circadian is regulated by the sun rising and setting for us.  That's what signals us to be on that cycle.  So it's understandable if they're getting that exposure that they're now -- that's part of that challenge to the adaptation that we started talking about.  The body is incredibly adaptive as we learn if we fly to a new time zone.  In about two to three days we can adapt to that new time zone.  But 16 new time zones a day makes it more challenging [inaudible] adaptive.    Host: That's right.  You can almost call the Station the time zone of its own.  You know, there's very -- there's no places, there's no few places, there's no places on Earth where the sun rises 16 times in a single day --    Dr. Tom Williams: Right.    Host: -- in a 24-hour cycle.  But that's interesting.  You know, I'm glad you guys aren't studying me because I would be all over the place, and I like my blackout curtains, so, you know, the sun rising and sunsets does not have any impact on me.  But are you guys questioning the crew?  Are you -- you know, when you're trying to understand why they're getting less sleep, do you -- do they give you feedback?  It's because maybe at the end of the day I'm so exhausted from a day, I just want to look out the window for a little bit, and I'm kind of going into my sleep time, and to just, to look at the window, and just sort of relax for a bit.  Are they doing stuff like that?    Dr. Tom Williams: Yes.  So the crew have been debriefed, and among the reasons that they cite and in particular a good reason to have private sleeping quarters on station or on a craft, one of the reason is they may get disturbed by another crew member who gets up to go to the bathroom at night, much like married couples might experience if someone's making noise.  That noise is now causing the person to stir.  Other activities might be noise or an alarm that goes off that needs to be attended to.  And the sleep cycle itself may be interfered with by just the intense workload.  So we know that stress and the demands that are placed upon us during the day will cause the sleep architecture to shift and then make us more vulnerable to being awakened, and some of that goes back to the evolutionary time where in our evolutionary past those humans that were more alert to potential danger in the middle of the night were the ones who passed their genes on later.   Those who slept deeply through the fact that a saber-toothed tiger may be coming in the cave that they were sleeping in, they tended not to survive.    Host: Yeah.  Natural selection and -- yeah.  It -- you're not going to survive a saber-toothed tiger for sure.  Now we're talking about some studies to recognize these behaviors, to understand what is happening and why it's happening.  Are we also looking into these countermeasures to see -- we understand a little bit of what's happening and we've come up with these methods on how to maximize crew performance.    Dr. Tom Williams: Yeah.  We've looked at a number of different countermeasures, some of which are sleeping medications.  So, for example --    Host: Oh.    Dr. Tom Williams: -- looking at what is the best dosage level of a sleep aid that allows you to wake up in the middle of the night and respond to an emergency situation.  So that was one great research project that was done that basically allowed us to then determine if someone is awakened by an alarm, how responsive can they be on which dosage level so that we ensure that we've got the right dose and the right medication so that, although we want you to sleep, we don't want you to sleep through an alarm that may have needed your action to save the process that was now being threatened that the alarm was alerting you to.  So that's one approach as a countermeasure.  The other is to teach some of the good classic [inaudible] behavioral skills that allow you to self-regulate, that allow you to be able to go through a series of relaxation processes, being mindful about what are the things that are stressing you and then self-regulate those in such a way that the stress levels don't raise as high as they would have without that, that then helps modulate some of that reaction to stress that would rob us of our sleep.   So a number -- and then other factors are to basically look at what within your private crew quarter area, for example the lighting system, just like on our iPhones, we can adjust the settings to ensure that we're not getting that bright blue light at night that would stimulate our awakening, we've changed the lighting around the private crew quarters on station.  And we have a lighting effects study going on now that's looking at as these lights are adjusted, does that have an impact on the sleep cycle of the crew members?    Host: You know, after learning about that, that lighting effects study, I purposely downloaded a blue light filter, so that way, if I'm looking at my phone at night, it get's that warm screen because I recognized that that is something that really can affect your sleep and, therefore, your performance.  And that's actually a good bouncing off point is we're talking a lot about sleep and how it affects performance and behavior which is a huge part of isolation, too.  It seems like getting more sleep can maybe help with some of those feelings of isolation and behavior changes.  Is there a correlation there?    Dr. Tom Williams: Well, there's probably a happy balance that you get because sometimes when people are isolated they sleep more --    Host: Hmph.    Dr. Tom Williams: -- but they sleep more because they're becoming more depressed or they're becoming --    Host: Oh.    Dr. Tom Williams: -- because of that lack of engagement in their environment, there's fewer stimuli, they're becoming more bored, it's more monotonous, and people who are bored in a monotonous situation tend to doze off and tend to -- because of the lack of stimulation.  So there is unhappy balance that we have to find.  And we know that sleeping too much can be as bad as not sleeping enough.  So finding -- and the interesting thing is there are great individual differences that people have in terms of how much sleep they really need.  We pretty much know that almost every human being needs at least four hours of sleep at night just to maintain their ability to do things.    Host: Right.    Dr. Tom Williams: But when you're not getting that sort of optimal level, you're going to notice differences where they might have little periods of microsleep or doze off for just a moment.  They might not even be aware of it.  But the optimal is seven for most people.    Host: Hmm.  Four hours is just to survive.  Beyond that, that's where, you know, that's where the behavioral performance and making sure long-term health is maintained.  That seven is good.  You know, we're talking a lot about station and we're talking a lot about space flight and sleep.  I kind of want to take a step back and think about, you know, beyond space flight -- space flight is a great example of isolation because you're literally in a capsule far away from everything.  But it's not the only place where isolation can be studied.  Are we polling some studies and data from other instances of isolation?  Like where else could humans be isolated that we're getting this information?    Dr. Tom Williams: Well we certainly use our analogs a great deal.  We also look across at, for example, submarines, and we know that individuals will be out on a submarine for anywhere from six to nine months on occasion.  So what we get from that is what it's like to be isolated, but it's not a perfect analog for us because most of the crew on a submarine are much younger than our average age astronaut of about 42.  The crew on a submarine are going to be primarily much younger in that mid-20 range for most, and then you'll have a small contingent of maybe mid-30s.  And they have more variety, more recreation, more opportunities to interact because there's a larger number on a submarine than the small crew of four or six --    Host: Right.    Dr. Tom Williams: -- we might have.  And then when we look at, on an oil rig, for example, same thing.  We've got -- there are certain similarities -- they're isolated, they're sort of away from most of the social connection that might be there, and you tend to get high-achieving individuals who have -- they're working in an extreme environment, so they have to be vigilant and attentive, and there's stress and there's new technology that gets introduced, and so they have to be adaptable to those demands.  But, again, they -- and they will get some sleep cycle adjustments because of the shifts that they have to pull.  But what we find is that they're not the perfect match.  And so we take pieces of each of these analogs and these different groups and we put together into this sort of a mosaic that says we've got some understanding of what human beings are like in this environment, and we can generalize to this level.   And we get some in our high-fidelity analogs, and we get a little bigger understanding.  But the best analog is the Space Station itself because there we've got the full complement of adaptations that have to be considered and that is the altered gravity, the other for-space flight hazards that you're series is focused on.    Host: Right.    Dr. Tom Williams: All of those come together into the human.  We have to understand the full complement of how those may be impinging on each of those areas.  So is isolation in confinement much worse when you're in an altered gravity environment --    Host: Oh, yeah.    Dr. Tom Williams: -- at great distance from Earth?  And that's part of what we're looking at.  And some of our research is we're looking at when you have a stress condition in altered gravity that gets irradiated, is that worse than just being isolated, just being stressed, or just being irradiated?  So we've tended to focus more on the individual risk.  But we know our crew are going to experience in an integrated potentially synergistic way.  So how do we anticipate that?    Host: That's very interesting.  Yeah, it does make sense to just focus on one thing because that's not what the environment is.  The environment's going to throw at you altered gravity and radiation and all and being far away.  All these different hazards have to come together, and you have to make sure performance is maximized.  And you're not just, all right, we fixed the isolation thing.  Oh, yeah, what about radiation?  What about, you know, change in gravity, all those kinds of things?  So what element -- let's pick on oil rigs for a second.  What elements or oil rigs and the folks that work there are we looking at and taking to space flight and how we deal with isolation?    Dr. Tom Williams: Some of what we look at there is some of the occupational surveillance that gets done with oil rig workers.  So how does their sleep get interfered with by the demands of their schedule when they have sleep-shifting?  So just like we have on a slam shift on station when a Soyuz docking comes in.  If they have some event that occurs that alters their sleep, what's the sleep cycle changes that we see?  We also look at -- they tend to be sort of high-performing extreme environment individuals.  How do they handle the stress?  How do they -- and they're gone for periods of time and then reintegrate with the family.  So there's a multiple kind of context of different things that we can look at with them that help inform us about if they've got an effective countermeasure.  Then we look at how might we adapt that to our circumstance.    Host: Yeah, that's big.  I mean just -- you're not just going to let someone just go on an oil rig and say all right, 'bye, have fun.  It's the monitoring aspect that really helps you to understand what's going on throughout the whole time they're on an oil rig, and that -- and you translate that directly to a space flight.  That's why we're doing it.  That's why we're actually paying attention and monitoring these changes over time.  And that's a huge element that I think is important for astronauts, too, you know.  Astronauts -- I always look up to them because they're such amazing human beings, just physically, mentally, just unbelievable what they can endure.  And that's different from just me going out on an oil rig or up there because they are just superior human beings.  And I think that's having that as an element, as a factor for understanding isolation is pretty big.  You have to have high-performing individuals.  Sure, you as a researcher can control some things, but ultimately you've got to have the best of the best that are going out there.    Dr. Tom Williams: Agreed.  Which has been -- and we do make great efforts to make sure that individuals who apply fully understand what it is they're asking to be a part of --    Host: Right.    Dr. Tom Williams: -- and then they go through a very demanding process to make sure that they reflect those characteristics that are going to position them for success, to be honest.  I mean, we want to select people who are going to be successful operating in the extreme environments that we're going to place them in.  And so there's great demands that will placed on him, great achievements that are possible.  How do we align the capabilities and aptitudes with those demands?  And that's part of what our selection process looks at.    Host: Mm-hmm.  You know, I just realized we've been talking a lot about we, we here at NASA, and we're talking about a big broad thing.  But you have a very extensive yourself.  So how did you officially come to NASA and what's your background in that led you to start studying isolation?    Dr. Tom Williams: So I have a PhD in Clinical Psychology from St. Louis University, and that was probably, in part, the foundation that helped me find myself here because of the great connection between the science and practice that the program offered there.  And part of what my background was was in running an executive health program for executive leaders and developing leader development strategies and approaches and 360 feedback tools for them.  And in 2009 I was asked to come and help with astronaut selection and found that really an exciting opportunity and decided if I ever had the opportunity I wanted to come and be a part of NASA's mission because of the importance of it, the strategic nature of it, and because of the contribution that it makes to our nation and to the world to be honest.  So I found the opportunity in a position that became available that someone here at NASA made me aware of that they felt I would be an appropriate person for that.   And I have not been disappointed in the opportunity.    Host: That's awesome.  You know, I didn't realize you were part of the selection process.  You know, thinking about it from your psychology background, and when you were looking at these individuals and maybe interviewing them, what about their personality qualities about them did you really look for to know that they were going to be able to handle the stresses of space flight and be able to handle isolation instance?    Dr. Tom Williams: Well, just like you might imagine.  You're looking for individuals who have demonstrated that they've been able to handle challenging experiences, challenging demanding occupational backgrounds, and shown an adaptability to these differing demands that we know we're going to place on them.  So it's the adaptability, it's the achievement orientation, it's the resiliency.  You don't have to be the perfect individual, but you have to be the individual that has demonstrated that you're able to learn from, adapt, and grow stronger as a result of the experiences that you've encountered and the demands or the different challenges that you've overcome.  So just like explorers of old, the people who planfully look at what has to happen, take steps to prepare themselves to do those adaptations, those demands, to meet those demands, are those individuals who are going to be successful.   And that's what we're looking for is -- you now, it's -- there's an old strategist, Colin Grey, who once said, \"We're always going to be surprised by different events.  We just can't afford to be catastrophically surprised.\"  And so what we want are individuals who allow us to avoid being catastrophically surprised.  So we want the right people with the right mix of skills, with the right abilities, who can handle those surprises that are going to come up that we can't anticipate and plan for every possible outcome.  But with the right, resourceful, adaptive individual, they can handle those situations and make sure that we achieve success.    Host: And you know because based on their resume, they have already handled that situation.  I know just in our 2017 class I believe either two or three, I believe, of the astronauts that were selected had Antarctic expeditions.  I just just in that small group.  So you know they're going to be able to handle a dangerous environment, a stressful environment.  And then that translates perfectly to long-duration space exploration.  And the further we go out, you know, they know they'll be able to handle themselves.  That experience goes miles.  So also thinking about the stuff that you've done, especially here at NASA, are there any studies here at NASA that you've done specifically that you've focused on or are related to isolation or psychology?    Dr. Tom Williams: Well, as the element scientist, I look across the portfolio of the different risks that we have basically responsibility for .    Host: Okay.    Dr. Tom Williams: So we're looking at nine of the 32 risks that are focused on reducing that risk that we need to have reduced in order to basically successfully go on a long-duration mission.  So my position identifies are are the research kind of lanes that need to be addressed, and working closely with the discipline scientist for each of those risks, then integrating and determining how best to meet those, either with a directed study, usually with a -- the default is always to go with a solicited study.  And we bring in some of the most premier researchers in the world and a lot that are focused on -- their expertise is really designed to help us characterize the risk, reduce the risk, or develop countermeasures once we've understood the risk.  And so we're very fortunate to have great researchers like -- you heard me mention Chuck Czeisler and Laura Barger on the sleep area.   David Dinges from the University of Pennsylvania and Matthias Bazner working with us closely to help identify what are the impacts of sleep and what are the cognitive changes that may accrue as a result of that.  So putting those studies, building a solicitation that helps us look out to say what are the ways in which these risk factors may interplay and how do we then design research to help us characterize the risk to ensure that we've got the appropriate understanding to prepare our crew appropriately or to develop countermeasures in case that risk gets realize in some way?    Host: So you're like a -- you're a big-picture guy.  You're looking at the whole landscape and then picking these studies.  So you're talking about nine of the 32 risks you said.  You said 32.  The 32 risks of what?  Of the human in space?    Dr. Tom Williams: Right.  So we have the five space flight hazards.    Host: Right.    Dr. Tom Williams: And then there are 32 risks that the Human Research Program has identified that we look at and know that there is some evidence that it may pose a risk to either crew health or performance, or to the mission.  And so our risks are then -- our job is to identify, well, what's the evidence that we have, and what's the gap, the research gap, the lack of understanding that we may have about that particular risk, and then how do we bring to bear an understanding that characterizes that risk, gives us a tool or technology that may help us counter it, and gives us a method to basically provide to the crew to help them reduce that risk.  So, for example, we talked about sleep as one of those risks.    Host: Mm-hmm.    Dr. Tom Williams: And then build -- basically take our capability to the extent that we've reduced the likelihood and consequence of that particular risk being realized on a mission.  And so that's our goal, is to bring scientific information to bear, and we're in an applied science program, so bring scientific evidence to bear that helps us then reduce that risk to an acceptable level.  Because of the extreme nature of space flight and just the hazards that are always going to be there, we can't run a mission without any risk.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Tom Williams: But how do we get it to an acceptable level so that we were able to successfully send and return a crew safely back to Earth?    Host: Mm-hmm.  Acceptable is a pretty subject sort of feeling, too, because what is acceptable?  What is -- what do you determine that you are comfortable with that amount of risk?  It sounds like maybe it has to do with knowledge.  You know, you've looked at the risk and you've asked a lot of questions, and answer a few of them, and understand the overall capabilities of the risk.  And maybe it's that understanding that allows you to determine that, yes, maybe this is an acceptable level that we've reached.  Is that kind of the process?    Dr. Tom Williams: It's a good description of it.  Basically what makes it acceptable is we're not going to lose crew, we're not going to harm them in some way, and we're going to have a successful mission.  So we want to get the percentage of risk down to a level that the leadership makes the determination this is now an acceptable level where we're not going to lose crew nor harm them in some way nor impact the likelihood of achieving the mission's success.  So that's what determines the acceptability.    Host: Okay.  So you talked about you're focusing on nine.  Sounds like sleep, just sleep is a category of its own, right?  Is sleep just a risk?  And then you have several studies that are looking just at that risk?  Is that how that works?    Dr. Tom Williams: Exactly.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Tom Williams: So with our sleep risk area, we have about eight different gaps that we have -- we know that we need to address.  Now sleep is one of those areas that we have probably characterized most of the risk to an acceptable level.    Host: Oh.    Dr. Tom Williams: So we know that -- we know how much sleep people need.  We know we don't get enough, and we know that we need strategies and countermeasures to address it when we don't get enough.  But some of the others are the behavioral risk factors.  So our behavioral medicine risk deals with when we're isolated and confined, what are the psychological processes that start to accrue that may potentially create a vulnerability to become depressed or anxious or to feel the lack of energy to get the job done that the crew needs to do?  And there have been little hints of that, that a crew both in analogs and sometimes on mission, you'll see evidence that something is causing a decrease in activity.  So the question is, does -- is that moving toward a condition that would concern us or is it just an adaptation that the person is making?   And we don't -- that's -- again, we don't want to be surprised in a long-duration mission by something happening.  So we want to look at that carefully, address the evidence that we have, and then develop a countermeasure in anticipation that that may happen.  So, therefore, deal with it ahead of it.    Host: Hmph.  Do you notice -- you know, thinking about this idea of maybe isolation, depression, and signs of it, maybe decreased performance and abilities to complete tasks.  You talked in the beginning of our discussion about looking out the window and how often they're doing that.  Are you monitoring how often they're doing it or for how long they're doing it?  Is that part of the study, to determine, oh, maybe this person might be feeling a little off today because they've been at the window for way longer than usual.    Dr. Tom Williams: We don't do that precisely.  We just note activity levels.  But one of the things we will monitor, for example, are journaling.  So --    Host: Ah.    Dr. Tom Williams: -- in the crew journal, and they do it anonymously, but we'll make note of how many references they may make to home or to family or to relationships, and to sleep.  So what -- when they're journaling and writing about their day, what are the types of things that draw their attention?  There's a famous study, sort of referred to as Aging With Grace where they took the letters that young women would write to enter a novitiate to become a nun.  And they could predict, based on the letter that was written in the early, late teens, early 20s, they could predict who was likely to have Alzheimer's with a high degree of predictability later in life by the nature of how open, how expressive, how many details they talked about in their life, how many things they had engaged in, was predictive as to who would get Alzheimer's later in life.   So when you take evidence like that and you say, when someone's journaling, how rich is the content?  What can we discern from the pattern of expressions?  And do they change over time?  So how did they start?  And how did they change over time?  Or did they stay consistent?  And you can use that to infer that there's been a change in the adaptability because they started a certain way.  What has now operated on this individual that has caused them to now change the approach?  And then we have to infer from that certain patterns that may give us insight into what may have been the reason for that change.    Host: Interesting.  I wouldn't have thought about that.  So for the nuns it was the more detail they gave, the less likely or the more --    Dr. Tom Williams: The less likely.    Host: The less likely.  So they were more vague.  You were talking they had a better chance of getting Alzheimer's when they were early.    Dr. Tom Williams: Yes.    Host: Wow.  All right.  I'm going to start journaling and taking detailed notes of every excruciating --    Dr. Tom Williams: Exactly.    Host: -- part of my life.    Dr. Tom Williams: Exactly.    Host: It's not going to be an interesting read but I do -- yeah.  I mean, that's an awful, awful disease.  But it's interesting that you can tell it that early just based on how much detail and how much recollection you have.    Dr. Tom Williams: And if you think about what we talked about in terms of just the human's ability to adapt, what that says is they've got lots of connections.  And when you relate it back to what we talked about in being isolated and confined, we're talking about removing lots of connections.  And so what we want to be alert to is how does the mind attempt to adapt to it's environment?  And someone who's more closed off, not as expressive, isn't engaging their environment as much as the person who's very open, engaging, seeking experiences.  And from that we need to learn and identify what are the strategies that we could bring that would help counter some of the potential impact of restricting those experiences?    Host: Hmm.  So I want to look ahead.  I want to jump ahead to a mission to the moon or to Mars, a long-duration stay.  From your perspective, what are the crew doing to maintain their behavioral performance, to make sure that they are performing and not feeling these feelings of isolation and confinement?  What is part of their daily lives that will help them to be successful on these missions?    Dr. Tom Williams: That's a really important point and question because part of what we know that helps off of us feel effective is if we have meaningful and relevant things to do each day.  So part of a mission planning will have to be meaningful activities that matter, that help them feel like they're making a contribution, because we're taking high-achieving, high-functioning individuals and we're going to put them on a mission.  And we got to make sure that we keep them engaged on activities that they feel are worthy of their time, that help them feel as though they're making the contribution to the overall success of the mission, and that also help them grow, that help make those connections like we were just referring to in terms of keeping the mind stimulated, to be challenging in some way, but not to the point where it frustrates, but to the point where the mind is engaged and growing, because that's what helps us adapt each day to our environment.   And so part of what we're looking at is what type of training might we do en route as opposed to filling all the time ahead of the mission and putting all the demands on the crew before they launch if we know there's going to be long periods of time where they're just transiting from Earth to, for example, Mars.  How do we take advantage of that time by giving them the training that's most appropriate and most timely for when they have to do the task?  So that's one of the approaches that we're taking with regard to that.    Host: That's right.  So they could potentially launch from the Earth going to a long destination far away and not have all the information already packed into their brain to be successful on that mission, knowing that you have, let's just call it six to nine-month journey to Mars.  That's six to nine months of learning that you can do, that you can be training and constantly engaging your brain to learn something new, not just a refresher, but something entirely new.  That's interesting.  I wouldn't have thought of that.    Dr. Tom Williams: And it's a combination because it is -- it's a refreshing because some things we may have trained them to do two years before launch.    Host: Ah.    Dr. Tom Williams: And so how do we identify which of the tasks that need to be refreshed?  Which are the ones that need to be learned new, that it would be okay to learn for the first time about a month before you need them?  And which of the tasks that were required that you may need during the mission, during that transit time, which -- when do you need which training at what sequence?  And so that's part of what we're trying to make a determination for.    Host: Interesting.  It's good to know that we're kind of approaching this, when we're talking about the five hazards, we're approaching it from all different angles.  And I love how you said they're all integrated, too.  You know, we're talking about isolation and we're focusing a little bit on that, but in all of these studies, you know, altered gravity and radiation and being far away, all of these things are very big considerations for how to be successful in anything that you're studying.  So, Tom, I appreciate you coming on today and sharing your perspective about this idea of isolation and confinement so we can go farther into the cosmos.    Dr. Tom Williams: Great.  Thank you very much for your interest and for your time and letting us share this with you.     [ Music and Inaudible Speakers ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So that was Dr. Tom Williams.  We talked about isolation today.  And that was part two of our five-part series on the Hazards of Human Space Flight.  If you have been listening to Houston, we have a podcast in order.  You already listened to our talk with Zarana Patel for Radiation.  That was part one.  And then next week we'll be talking about the Distance From Earth.  If you want to know more about the Hazards of Human Space Flight, you can go to NASA.gov/hrp.  This podcast series is -- we're working hand-in-hand with the Human Research Program to produce a lot of content around these hazards.  They have a video series and their whole website dedicated to the five hazards of human space flight.  So just go to NASA.gov/hrp if you want -- for more information there.  There are actually really cool animation videos.  Otherwise you can go on social media, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and NASA Johnson Space Center Accounts.  Use the hashtag askNasa on your favorite platform to submit an idea or a question for the show so we can bring it and maybe make a whole episode out of it.   So this podcast was recorded on June 22, 2018.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, Pat Ryan, Bill Stafford, Kelly Humphries, Bill Pulaski, Judy Haze, Esidra [assumed spelling] Raina, Mel Whiting, and Natalie Gogan [assumed spelling].  And thanks again to Tom Williams for coming on the show.  We'll be back next week with part three of five of the Hazards of Human Space Flight discussing the Distance From Earth.  See you then.",

        title: "Mars is Hard.  Here's Why.",
        description: "Pat Ryan:  Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the first episode of the second year of the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center.  This is episode 53; Mars is hard, here's why.  I'm Pat Ryan, your introducer this week.  Gary Jordan comes up in just a moment.  This is where we bring NASA's scientists, engineers, astronauts, and other experts to talk about the stuff you want to know about human spaceflight.  This week's guest covers a few of those boxes.  Dr. Stan Love, bachelor's degree in physics, masters and PhD in astronomy, was selected as a NASA astronaut in 1998 and flew to the International Space Station in 2008 on the space shuttle mission that delivered and installed the European Space Agency's Columbus Laboratory Module.  Stan spent more than 15 hours outside the station on two spacewalks on that mission.  He also operated the robotic arms on the station and the shuttle Atlantis.   Since then, he's worked in a number of flight analog programs on land and underwater programs that are figuring out the nuts and bolts of how to make deep-space missions work as planned.  So, he understands better than most why sending human people to Mars will be really hard to pull off, but not impossible.  And he talked with Gary about the details of that earlier this year.  So, as they say, let's jump right ahead to Gary's talk with Dr. Stan Love.  Enjoy.     Episode 53 showcases Dr. Stan Love, a NASA astronaut, who flew to the International Space Station in 2008 on the space shuttle mission that delivered and installed the European Space Agency's Columbus Laboratory Module.  Stan has worked in a number of flight analog programs on land and underwater programs that are figuring out the nuts and bolts of how to make deep-space missions work as planned.  He understands better than most why sending human people to Mars will be really hard.   [ Music ]    Host: Houston, we have a podcast.     [ Music ]    Gary Jordan (Host):  All right, Stan, thank you so much for coming today and talking about why Mars is hard.    Stan Love: My pleasure.    Host: So, this is -- this is a kind of a continuation of -- this was the talk that you gave a while back and it was -- and I -- my compliments to you.  It was wonderfully, wonderfully engaging and you sort of spelled out in various different areas as to the why Mars is hard.  And you kind of sectioned it off in a way that is super understandable really.  It was a good presentation.    Stan Love: Thank you.    Host: So, if you wanted to, I mean since you're here, let's go through that step by step.  And you kind of categorized it into several different things.  I guess the first thing we can start with is the one that said that's pretty obvious is distance.  Mars and Earth are pretty far apart.    Stan Love: Yes, they are.  So, the Moon is pretty far away.  It's a planet-sized object and you look at it in the sky and you can blot it out with your thumb, okay?  So, it's pretty far away.    Host: Yeah.    Stan Love: Mars is a world sized object and it's a dot, okay?  You don't even see a disc.    Host: Right.    Stan Love: And it's a dot that most people can't go out and even point to at night.  I mean it is -- it is bright among stars and it is kind of reddish but 99.9% of the population, if you took them outdoors and said point at Mars, they would be -- yeah, I got no clue.    Host: Yeah.  Yeah.    Stan Love: So, take something Earth-sized and remove it so that it's a dot, that's how far away we're talking.  The simple terms that I like to use is the International Space Station orbits the Earth about 250 miles up, okay, pretty close, just sort of above the atmosphere.  The Moon at 250,000 miles is about 1,000 times further into space than the space station.  So, space station is well known to us, you know, there's a lot of people alive now who were never alive when there wasn't people living in space, right?    Host: That's right.    Stan Love: For 20 years now, we've had people living in space continuously on the space station and we're used to cargo ships coming and going and crews launching and landing and that has become -- I'm not going to say boring, but at least a frequent.    Host: Yeah.    Stan Love: Not routine, but frequent.  We managed to send six crews to the Moon 40 years ago when we had a 10 times larger share of the federal budget to work with and nobody's been back since.  And part of that is because the Moon, at 250,000 miles, is 1,000 times further into space than the space station, 1,000 times, so that's the difference between two steps and a mile.  That's the difference between walking a mile and going to Europe, okay?  So, space station is, you know, I drive down to the gas station.  The Moon is, I'm going to Europe, okay?    Host: Wow.    Stan Love: Mars, at its furthest, is on the order of 250 million miles away from the Earth, or 1,000 times further into space than the Moon or a million times further into space than the space station.  So, as one step, so 3,000 miles.    Host: Oh, my gosh.    Stan Love: So, Mars is a long ways off.    Host: Yes.    Stan Love: It is, again, think of the Earth and remove it so far that it's a dot.  Think of a million times further in space than the space station.  Think of the difference between walking across your living room and walking to Tibet.    Host: So, there's a lot of considerations to think about why that is difficult.  One, it's going to take us longer to get there.    Stan Love: Yeah.    Host: And in space, that's a huge consideration because that means you have to have stuff that works long enough and well enough that is going to -- and reliably enough that when you get there, you'll still be alive.    Stan Love: That is absolutely true and that's not just your life-support equipment though, it's everything on board that spacecraft.  You have to make sure you have the supplies for that kind of thing.  Think about what you pack for a weekend trip.  Think about your pack if you were going to some place that didn't have modern conveniences and we're going for a week, and now think that's going to be a three-year round-trip to Mars and I get -- there are no stores.  There is no place to get anything.  I have to bring everything I need and oh, by the way, I'm in an environment that will kill me in about three minutes the whole time, out there and back, and would render me unconscious in seven seconds, so I don't even have three minutes to do stuff.    Host: Yeah, you got to -- you got to -- it's like taking a road trip, planning everything ahead of time and oh, by the way, you're not allowed to stop.    Stan Love: That's right, no stopping.    Host: So, yeah, that's -- it's going to be quite a long time, quite a long time to get there.  And there's more, you -- like you said, the life-support systems, you got a plan ahead.  You got to have food that's going to last you that long.  You got to have, you know, a life-support system, oxygen, water, toilet --    Stan Love: Yeah.    Host: That's going to work the whole time.    Stan Love: Yeah, and by the way, the toilet is part of your water and oxygen supply, [inaudible].    Host: Ah, so if the toilet breaks, that also means that you're going to be able to [inaudible].    Stan Love: Yeah.  Yeah, what a way to die, right?  I was going to be the brave first explorer on Mars and I died because the toilet broke, that's not going to look good.    Host: So, I mean besides the distance, I -- this is sort of related, and this was actually a part of your talk was to get there, I mean it's farther away and you have to have systems that work pretty reliably to get you there, but also you have to have the energy to get you there, that sort of requires more propulsion.    Stan Love: It sure does.    Host: Yeah.    Stan Love: Although, interestingly, the amount of proposing you need for a roundtrip to the Moon is just a little bit less than what you need for a round trip to Mars.  Robert Heinlein famously said that once you're in low Earth orbit, you're halfway to anywhere in the universe, and this is not that big an exaggeration.    Host: Really.    Stan Love: Yeah.    Host: Because -- I guess the most of the amount of energy is just getting you off get off of Earth.    Stan Love: Getting off of Earth, right.  Then you got to get away from Earth.    Host: Right.    Stan Love: When you approach Mars, you know, in space, there are no free lunches.  You got to pay to slow down too.  Fortunately, Mars has an atmosphere that we can use to aerobrake in, but the air is too thin to land on parachutes the way we land our capsules on Earth today because we have a nice, thick atmosphere on Earth.  So, you do have to pay propulsion to land yourself softly on Mars, just the way we had to pay in propulsion to land ourselves softly on the Moon.    Host: Yes.    Stan Love: Then you have to take off of Mars again and that's a challenge because Mars is a planet and taking off a planet is hard.  If you go down to Kennedy Space Center and see all that stuff down there?  That -- all those dedicated people, and all that amazing, huge hardware that's to get ready to launch from Earth.  When the first people come back from Mars, they're going to have to launch themselves off a planet without the benefit of Kennedy Space Center.  They're going to have to do all that themselves.    Host: Yeah.    Stan Love: And the only infrastructure -- gantries, towers, vehicle assembly building, they'll have to bring that themselves, that's going to be hard.    Host: And yeah, use it themselves, right?  They don't have -- they don't have the ground support.    Stan Love: They don't have the ground support.    Host: Yeah.  Well, I mean they'll have some people talking to them but it's going to be a while until their message reaches them.    Stan Love: Yeah, it can be as long as a 40 minute round-trip between asking a question and getting an answer.    Host: Yeah, that's a -- that's a pretty dull conversation.    Stan Love: Yeah, and not only is the time delay tough but the further away your communication antennas are, the slower the rate of transmission that you have.  So, from space station, we have millions of bits per second coming back and forth all the time, it's awesome.  We've got good communication satellites, we're set.  But now when you go a million times further out into space, your communication rate, using the same assets, drops by a million squared or a trillion.  So, if I have megabits per second and divide that by a trillion.  Now we can do better than that with our Mars probes but, you know, we have a bigger -- even bigger antennas that we use for those guys.  And so, your data rate is not going to be what you expect, it's going to be worse than dial-up.  Nobody wants to live with dial-up anymore.    Host: Well, okay, so we were talking about taking off from Mars is going to be a challenge, right?    Stan Love: Yeah.    Host: You have to -- you have to sort of build your own Kennedy Space Center and operate it by your -- you know, pretty much by yourself, the communications going to be pretty hard.  And launching off a planet.  You said the planet is going to be difficult.  Now we've landed on the Moon and we've actually took -- taken off from the Moon.    Stan Love: Absolutely, yup.    Host: So, how did that work?    Stan Love: Well, that we're great because the Moon doesn't have an atmosphere to create drag and it only has 1/6 of the Earth's gravity.  So, you don't have to make a pointy streamlined rocket to take off from the Moon, any old shape will do.  So, if you look at the lunar ascent module, it's just kind of this blocky, clumsy looking thing with jets sticking out the side and some angular facets.  It looks kind of like a big bug, that works just fine.  And you barely need any propellant to get off the Moon, it's easy.    Host: Wow.    Stan Love: Because the gravity is so much less and the speed you need to get into orbit around the Moon so less than it is from the Earth.  Mars is intermediate between the Earth and Moon so it's going to be easier to get off of than Earth but harder to get off of than Mars.  One of the things we're looking at is the chief weight that you would have to bring from Earth if you did a Mars trip the way we did the Moon trip would be the rocket propellant you need to take off of Mars.  You have to have haul all that stuff out of the Earth's gravity [inaudible], send it off to Mars, land it softly on Mars, and then you can burn it to get off of Mars, which is totally wasteful because the amount of propellant you need to move that propellant is going to be, you know, an aircraft carrier's worth of rocket fuel taking off from Earth and it's just absurd and we can't build anything that big.  So, we might want to try to make our rocket propellant, for the return trip, on Mars, which means we're going to bring a little chemical factory with us.  And we are going to collect carbon dioxide and water vapor from Mars' atmosphere, it has some of both.  And we can turn that into methane and liquid oxygen, which are dandy rocket propellants.    Host: Nice.    Stan Love: So, that is a possibility.  But now, we -- so we don't have to bring a big dang tank full of propellant with us from Earth, but we do have to bring a big dang chemical refinery.  And it's important that the rocket fuel be kind of pure or the engines don't work and, you know, so we have to do a good job of that.    Host: Right.    Stan Love: But that's definitely something that we're looking at very carefully is manufacturing as much as we possibly can with materials we find on Mars, so we don't have to bring it with us.    Host: Yeah, that's -- the term is Institute Resource Utilization.    Stan Love: Yes, we should come up with a better one.  That has too many words in [inaudible].  Living off the land is a term I've also heard that people can wrap their heads around a little easier.    Host: Yeah, so there's a lot of considerations and that's kind of a difficult thing about Mars, especially -- I'm thinking about entering Mars, is you have an atmosphere they have to deal with, but it's not really going to help you that much for -- in terms of using a parachute.    Stan Love: Right.  The -- the air is too thin to parachute.  So, we landed things with parachutes and airbags that lay it weighed less than and a half a ton or so, but bigger than that, that's not going to work anymore.  That's why we had this crazy sky crane concept for our latest Rover, you know?    Host: I remember that, yeah.    Stan Love: That would come [inaudible] on parachutes, and then it would fire jets, and hover above the ground, and then its cables would unreel and drop the -- or gently lower the Rover down to the ground.  As soon as it touched the ground, the cables would separate, and the platform would fly away and crash -- not on the Rover, and all this worked, and even the engineers who designed it said they were very relieved.    Host: Right.    Stan Love: When it works.  So, that's for a one-ton Rover.  Now for a human lander, we probably need -- you probably want to land in something you can live in for a while because you're probably committed to a year -- an Earth year or so on the surface of Mars and you don't want to have to walk over to a habitat when you've just landed after nine months in space because people come back from space station, they have a little trouble walking.    Host: Yeah.    Stan Love: And they don't have to walk in a spacesuit, which you have to do if you go outside on Mars, so very hard.  So, you need to land in something biggish, 40 tons-ish.  And now, the sky crane isn't going to be enough, and we're going to need something special and new, and I don't know what it is, to land a 40 ton payload softly on the surface of Mars.  But let's not, you know, dis Mars' atmosphere too much, because you're going to come in to Mars's atmosphere at 6 kilometers per second or something like that, and you can dump most of that speed by using a heat shield and slow you down to something like the speed of sound or, you know, one kilometer per second or so, and then you do the rest with the motor.  So, you really get a big help from that atmosphere.  It just doesn't help with the last few feet that you care about the most.    Host: Yes, exactly.  And I think the word you use that's also pretty important is softly because now you're not talking -- there's been a couple Rovers, right, that have just sort of -- has slowed down but slammed into the ground pretty hard.    Stan Love: Yeah, they inflated some airbags and they bounced around.  I think the first one that landed that way bounced like 18 times.  When they got the thing deployed and put the camera up and looked around they found 18 big puff marks on the ground where the thing had bounced and rolled around.  It actually rolled into a crater, a little crater, and that's where it ended up, so they called it Eagle crater, hole-in-one.    Host: I like that.  That's good.    Host: So, yeah, I mean like landing softly, but then also, you know, you have to slow down this larger object in a way that's not going to snap a human neck either, right?  Because there's been parachutes that have slowed down an -- a Rover pretty quickly but to the human body, you -- that's a consideration.    Stan Love: Yeah, you don't want the opening shock to kill your crew.    Host: Exactly.  Exactly.  I think -- that's another thing actually is talking about going into the Earth but actually -- actually going to Mars.  You're talking about using propellant to get you there and we talked a little bit about the fact that you don't need that much more propellant, but you need to get there pretty quickly, which means you got to speed up.  But then you have to land, which means you have to slow down.    Stan Love: Yeah.  Yeah, the faster you go to Mars, the more prop you pay to go faster, but then the more you have to pay to slow down.  And then with the rockets that we have today, we actually spend the vast majority of our time on the way to Mars just coasting.  You do -- the way rockets work is you do a burn, change your speed, and you are a -- you are a Hail Mary pass on a nine-month trajectory to hit a moving target.  So, we're not actually burning engines.  People watch, you know, science fiction shows, and that's -- things are burning engines all the time, [inaudible] we don't do that.  If you do do that, you have to bring even more propellant because it's not the most efficient way of doing it, not even just slowing down.  But the most efficient trajectory is very short burns and very long coast periods.  If you make it less efficient, you can get there faster, but now your rocket gets bigger, because you got to carry more propellant.  And bigger is more expensive, and then Congress says, why are you not using the most efficient way, and then we don't have a good answer for that.    Host: Right.  Yeah.  So, you -- that's something you got to think about.  Efficiency, I mean that's -- efficiency is related to cost too, it's related to resources, so there's a lot that goes into there.  Another fact that you sort of pointed out, when -- after you land on Mars, you know, you sped up, you used the propulsion to get you there efficiently, you've landed, but now one thing that we need to talk about is the orbits of the two planets, Earth and Mars.  Now you get there, it's not like, oh, yay, we're here, we can spend as much time as we want and then take off whenever we want.  There's orbits to consider and a length of time that you got to spend there.    Stan Love: Yeah.  So, this, again, is tied to rocket propulsion.  If we had warp drive and could go between the planets any time, no problem.  But when we're on rockets, that means we are restricted to these very precise trajectories.  And you only have a chance to throw that nine-month long pass at the moving Mars and have it hit the planet once every 26 months from Earth, so you'll hear about launch windows for Mars probes.  Every two years and two months, we have a chance to put some -- to send something to Mars.  If we miss that chance, oh, okay, well, you know, go do something in your office, and in two years and two months, we'll try again.  You can't -- you just can't put stuff toward Mars at any other time.  The planets have to be lined up just right and now I can throw that pass, same thing for Mars back to Earth.  Every 26 months, the planets line up properly so that you can send something to Mars back to Earth.  Any other time, you cannot go, and those periods don't happen at the same time, they're offset.  So, it turns out that when you have a launch window to Mars, you can throw something to Mars, it takes it 9ish months to get there.  Speed that up, but it's less efficient, more mass, more expense, Congress talks to us.   You land on Mars, now I got to wait for my launch window to come back from Earth, and that happens a year after I land, one Earth year, half a Mars' year.  So, you're going to go halfway around the Sun on the planet Mars, and then your launch window opens so you can come back to Earth.  So, once you have left Earth, and no spacecraft that we can possibly design has enough propellant on board to come back, once we've done that burn and headed off to Mars, you can't abort and say, no, I don't like this, I'm coming home.  You're committed.  You're committed to nine months out, you're committed to a year on the surface, you're committed to nine months back.  Now we can mess with things and say, well, what if we do a special different trajectory and we're going to come back and go closer to the Sun than the Earth and do a swing by the planet Venus and get a little boost from Venus' current gravity and then we'll come back to Earth a little earlier.  That adds complexity to your mission, now I got a have a bunch of heat shielding because I'm getting close to the Sun.  And as with certain other philosophical conflicts in spaceflight, there has been a great deal of discussion and no winner on whether it's better to just suck it up and do the long haul or try to be fancy and do this faster thing.   The pros and cons on both sides have not shown a clear victor on that one.  So, basically, when you are committing to Mars, you're committing to two and a half to three years away from the Earth and nothing important can break, nothing important can run out.  All those engine burns have to work right and you have to launch yourself off a planet without help.    Host: True.    Stan Love: Yeah.  So, again, I don't want to sound too gloomy.  The attention here is not gloom and not to -- not to say that, no, Mars is impossible and we should just give up.    Host: It's just hard.    Stan Love: But it's hard.  And, again, we need to go into this with open eyes and a clear understanding of what all the challenges are or we will not be successful.    Host: Now on the topic of trajectories and Mars' mission profiles, you know, staying there on the surface for a year, is there any other opportunity -- maybe a touch-and-go opportunity, or --    Stan Love: The touch-and-go -- without waiting the year for the launch window -- is one of these things that goes by Venus.    Host: Oh, that's the Venus option, okay.    Stan Love: Yeah.  Once every 50 years, there's a flyby opportunity that comes -- right -- goes -- whizzes past Mars, uses Mars' gravity.  You don't land, you don't stop.  But that Mars pass bends your trajectory so that it comes right back to Earth after 12 to 18 months.  And the -- that opportunity occurred this year.    Host: So, we missed it.    Stan Love: But we were talking about it.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Stan Love: The other disadvantage to that one is that you come quizzing by Mars at a very great rate of speed over the night side of the planet, so you're in space for nine months.  Then you get this close encounter over a planet that does not have city lights, or thunderstorms, or [inaudible], or anything else that glows, and that was your Mars pass.  So -- and the technology wasn't quite ready, but we were talking seriously about this three, four, five years ago, whether we might be able to use the 2018 flyby opportunity to do sort of a Hail Mary Mars mission.  And we decided that the odds of the crew surviving probably real good and the next chance is in 2068 and I hope we're way down the road.  I don't know about that you're in particular, but it's way down the road and hopefully we'll have people on Mars another way.    Host: Yes, exactly.  And that -- this is a huge consideration for -- we're talking about Mars missions, and we should probably clarify, people.  You know, we've done a -- we've done a lot of Rovers before but now there's a whole people element.    Stan Love: Yeah.    Host: And that's huge.    Stan Love: Yes, literally.  You can have a useful robot that weighs 500 pounds or a ton, right?  But if you're sending people, people got to live in an in a pressurized environment and the tin can gets real big, and then the rockets get real big, and you're talking about gigantic things.    Host: Yeah.  Yeah.  You're get -- people are pretty picky when it comes to --    Stan Love: Yeah, and they're fussy about being alive when they get there, and some of them are even fussy about coming home.  If you don't need to come home, it gets easier.  But, you know, in a habitat we could land, plus the radiation environment on Mars is not super healthy for you, you need to, you know, get 30 feet or so dirt over your head to block the cosmic rays.  The Earth has a nice magnetic field, a nice thick atmosphere that protects us from that stuff.  Mars doesn't have that.  So, nobody wants to emigrate to Mars to live in a room the size of a bathroom until they die of cancer three years later, that's just not fun.    Host: No.    Stan Love: So, again, not to cast gloom, we can do this.    Host: Yeah.    Stan Love: But we have to be smart about it.    Host: Exactly.  And we're thinking about it, that's the whole -- that' the whole point is we're considering every option to make sure that the mission is successful.  And one of the options is to -- so if you're talking about a Mars habitat, that habitat is not -- the pictures of the domes that you're seeing, the science fiction things, you're talking about going underground.    Stan Love: Yup.  Your dome is going to blow out, because the atmospheric pressure inside.  Mars' atmosphere is essentially no pressure, like being on Earth at 100,000 feet, and there's just nothing to breathe there.  So, yeah, you're probably going to need to be -- need to spend much of your time in -- with a lot of mass between you and those cosmic rays, which usually means going underground.  There may be solutions to that.  Right now, the radiation environment, as we understand it, you could spend that year on Mars and come back and you'd have a slightly higher risk of cancer than we allow administratively right now.  Right now, our career limit I think is at 3% excess rate of cancer in your lifetime and if you've gotten that much radiation, then you're not allowed to get any more radiation exposure.  The numbers I've seen for a Mars mission are about 5%, so not hugely more than our limit, but more than our limit.  But if you walked up to the astronaut office right now and said, okay, who wants to go to Mars?  By the way, you got a 5% risk of cancer instead of just 3%, every single hand would go up.    Host: Really.    Stan Love: Yeah, everybody would be willing to [inaudible].    Host: Everybody would be willing.  Interesting.    Stan Love: To be that first person on Mars.    Host: Oh, yeah.  Well, I mean it's a huge accomplishment and that's why we're striving so hard, so.    Stan Love: And that's an administrative limit, a stroke of a pen can make it go away.    Host: Yeah, plus 2, right?    Stan Love: Yeah.    Host: So, yeah.  That's huge.  But just the radiation environment.  And then -- so you're -- off of that point, you're monitoring -- even now on the space station -- how much radiation a crew member is receiving from being up there X amount of time.    Stan Love: Yeah, we're measuring it a lot.    Host: A lot.    Stan Love: We have film badges on the crew members and they wear them when they go out [inaudible] because you have less mass between you and the cosmic rays when you're out on a spacewalk.  We have radiation counters inside the space station at various places.  We've had mock-ups of human bodies made out of like plastic with about the same radiation properties as your body with radiation detectors on those to see how the radiation affects the interiors.  And we have a radiation detector on the Mars Rover that's on Mars right now measuring that radiation environment with an eye toward what the exposure of a person would be, okay?  We are also preparing for the next Mars Rover a tiny little experiment to make oxygen out of Mars's carbon dioxide atmosphere with an eye toward making rocket propellant and breathing air when we get to Mars.  So, we are -- we are thinking and doing what we can right now, even though we haven't embarked on the huge quest of launching a person.  But we're working on these problems and getting to understand them so that we know what we really have to do.    Host: And that's something that we would definitely have to consider is if we are considering landing humans on the surface of Mars, there will most likely be a lot of other stuff that has landed on Mars first.    Stan Love: Yes.    [00:25:53] Host: Okay.    Stan Love: So, yeah, we would definitely want to pre-place a big habitat.  We would probably want to pre-place our propellant tank.  And we would -- or our propellant plant.  And we want that propellant plant working.  And we would want it to report that the tanks were freaking full, before we even launched first, because of the tanks can't get full, I can't come back.  So -- and we might even pre- and place our Mars ascent vehicle, the thing we're going to use to launch off of Mars.  If you saw the movie, The Martian, that's the tactic that they use there, and that's probably a pretty good one.  But you want that thing there, you want to know it was in good health with full tanks before you even committed your crew to launching from Earth because if something goes wrong there, you can't come home.    Host: Yeah.  That's several years' worth of work to put everything -- and then to dig, to build a habitat, to fuel your rock.    Stan Love: And all those things are huge.  They're going to need a giant heavy lift rocket, such as our SLS heavy lift booster.  We can't produce those superfast, so we might only get two launches each launch window.  So, basically, on average, you're going to get -- you know, every two years, you get two big rockets -- two big payloads that go to Mars, and that's about as fast as we can produce those things, unless a miracle occurs, and we get a giant budget, then we can do a lot more a lot faster, but I'm not holding my breath.  I've been interested in space my whole life and Apollo doesn't seem to be happening again.  So, we could do more with more.  With what we have, you know, sort of every two years, two big payloads, and you send those there.  One thing that I've noticed is that each year, our robots get better and our rocket engines don't.  So, I expect that as we are formulating our Mars plans and robotics get better -- and oh, by the way, let's build a 3D printer that can make things out of dirt, okay?  You heat the dirt up to a high temperature, you [inaudible] the little grains together, like glass beads melting together.   And I can make a habitat on Mars before I even send a person.  And I don't even have to send a habitat or -- so I send a big 3D printer and a robot.  It sucks up sand and dirt.  It spits out bricks.  It builds me a big enclosure with a nice big, heavy roof that blocks radiation.  And then later, I go inside with a plastic bag to hold the air in.  So, I have the surrounding structure that's not airtight, and I make that airtight with a lining and bingo, I've got a nice house, and I didn't have to build it.  I did it all remote ops from Earth.    Host: Nice.    Stan Love: Okay, and that's just one of the little tricks that we can think of now that we might be able to do in the future.  That robotic propellant plant, we could do now, we know how to do that.  We haven't done it yet, it's going to be expensive.  But as the robots get better and people get smarter, we will be able to do more remotely with machines on Mars so that the Mars crew has more resources when, they get there they have less work to do when they get there, they know that everything is checked out and ready before they even launch.  And that, as we go forward in time, I think will get better and better.  And the prospects will get better and better for sending our people because we can have more things ready for them when they arrive.    Host: So, the habitat and the vehicle to get off, very important stuff to have ready before they get there.  So, what else would probably be a huge consideration to have ready by the time they get there?  My thought is food, right?  Would you -- would you bring food with you or would you stock it up?    Stan Love: So, one of the problems that we're working on with food is that thermal stabilized food, which is freeze-dried, or dried, or the stuff that they have in pouches in MREs for military troops, that's the kind of stuff we eat on the space station.  That stuff -- actually, the molecules that your body needs out of that to be nutritious don't last more than about a year.    Host: Oh, they break down.    Stan Love: So, you eat the food, it would taste normal, and it would fill you up, but it wouldn't sustain your body.  Now we can preserve food for decades and have it be perfectly healthy if we freeze it, but now that food has its full weight of water, and I have a big freezer.  Freezers are heavy, and freezers suck a lot of power.  Your refrigerator is probably the thing in your house that uses the most energy, and now I've got to have a giant walk-in freezer with five years' worth of food for six people and the freezer gets really big.  So, I don't think we can pre-place food, that's probably what you're going to want to bring with you.    Host: Interesting.    Stan Love: But anything that doesn't degrade in a year, you could.  You could have a giant tank of water waiting for you, big tanks of oxygen to breathe.  You can even pull nitrogen out of Mars's atmosphere, it's the it's also a common component in there.  So, we can make up the nitrogen part of our atmosphere that we breathe that our bodies don't use but it's nice to keep a comfortable pressure so you're not breathing pure oxygen and things burst into flame and pure oxygen, so we really like to breathe the normal mix of air.  So, there is a lot that we can do with machines that use what's available on Mars to be really ready, but I don't think food is going to be one of those.    Host: Okay, and that makes sense because you want to make sure that the food that you're going to eat is going to give you the nutrients that you need to survive, and yeah, that makes a lot of sense.  Kind of off of that point is, you know, you're building stuff ahead of time, you're doing a lot of planning, and now let's say you have everything ready, and you're on your way to Mars.  Everything is planned for you, but even on the way, you already mentioned that you can't really turn around.  And the reason you would probably want to turn around is if something was going wrong.    Stan Love: Yes.    Host: So, there's a lot of things that could go wrong on the way to Mars, right?    Stan Love: Yes.    Host: That means you have to have systems that are super, super reliable.    Stan Love: Yes.    Host: And including -- I mean it could be something that you can maybe control from an engineering perspective, like systems, but maybe there are some things that you cannot control, like a solar event.    Stan Love: Yeah, solar flare.  There was a solar flare during the Apollo program, but when an Apollo mission was not in the air, that would have killed the crew.    Host: Really.    Stan Love: Yeah.    Host: And --    Stan Love: It's amazing what's on Wikipedia [inaudible] You go, wow, [inaudible] that up.  So, yeah, that is a possibility, but it is a rare possibility.  Flares that size, I don't think there has been one since that one.    Host: Really.    Stan Love: I mean been that big, so that is a risk.  Micrometeoroid hit on your spacecraft, you have no way of detecting that ahead of time.  Bang, and you got a hole in your in your hull and you have to do that.  The -- but the odds are low, and I don't consider those higher risk than things like mechanical reliability and keeping people healthy and happy in that confined environment for that long time.  If you read the journals from Polar Explorers from a hundred years ago, they're isolated, they're confined, they're in an environment that they can at least go out and take a walk and, you know, and cool off if they're mad at their at their tent mate, literally cool off.  So, you don't have that option on a spacecraft on the way to Mars, but you read what became important to these people and it's just strange, like food.  It's all about the food after the first few months.  There's a wonderful book called Farthest North by Fridtjof Nansen.  He was a Norwegian Polar explorer in the late 1800s and at that time, people were trying to reach the North Pole and all the expeditions had their ships crushed in the ice and a few men trying to haul supplies back to land over the shifting Polar ice cap in the cold they all get scurvy and at some point, they have to eat the dogs.   Yeah.  And so, Nansen got the idea that he was going to achieve the North Pole by building a super-strong little, tiny ship and deliberately freezing it in the ice and using the natural flow of ice across the Arctic Ocean to just drift across the Pole.  And he found out about this ice drift by doing exploring on the north coast of Greenland and finding debris from one of the previous failed Polar expeditions that had gotten crushed on the other side of the Arctic Ocean, plus logs that had washed down rivers in Siberia that were trees that don't grow in North America that only grow in Siberia that washed there.  So, he did a lot of science first.    Host: Yeah.    Stan Love: So, he built this ship that had walls two feet thick.  He had a crew of about 13 people.  They had supplies for five years and they sailed around to the, you know, north of eastern Siberia, deliberately froze the ship in the ice, which was like the death knell for all previous expeditions.  And for three years, they drifted across the Arctic Ocean.  And they missed the pole, but they got closer than anybody else ever had.  And as they realized they were missing it they -- two of the guys, Nansen and one companion, got the dogs and tried to make a push across the ice to Pole, and they had to turn around, [inaudible], and then they ended up living in a -- spending the winter in a 6 by 6 foot stone hut made out of walrus hides in Franz Joseph land and they only had one sleeping bag between them and they didn't have to eat the dogs, but they had to feed the dogs to the other dogs, so it got exciting there.  But the rest of crew just fat, dumb, and happy ended up on the other side of the ocean, broke out of the ice near Spitsbergen, and all of them actually reunited in Norway a in the same month.    Host: No way.    Stan Love: Yeah, so that is what a Mars mission is going to be like.  Rad those journals.  They did a lot of science but most of the journal ended up being about the food.  There was -- you know, the environment was the same, the people were the same, and so they were going through the almanac looking for other nations' holidays to celebrate so they could have a feast, and it's all about the food.  So, we need to be careful about the food on a Mars mission and there's a lot we can learn from the expeditions of the distant past that hardly anybody's ever heard of that will make this an easier and better trip.    Host: Yeah.  I mean you -- like you said, there's a lot of science you can do ahead of time to prepare, but then you -- ultimately, once you go do it, there's stuff that you're figuring out along the way, food being a very important component.    Stan Love: Things about the people, the people in that environment and things that you might not predict.    Host: Yeah, and actually off of that point, you were talking about a transit vehicle to Mars, making sure they're healthy and happy on the way, and that's a pretty big consideration.  You have to have enough food, you have to make sure that they are going to be healthy, that their bones are not going to deteriorate, stuff we're learning on the International Space Station.  What is that vehicle going to look like and how is it going to help?    Stan Love: I don't think anybody knows what the Mars vehicle is going to look like.  But the space station is about -- actually about the right size to send 6-ish people on a multi-year expedition in space.  We carry enough spares and food in case a couple of car -- robot cargo ships don't make it.  You're looking at something in the size-ish of the International Space Station.  In the movie, The Martian, they did their homework.  And you saw their transit ship was -- looked a lot like the space station.    Host: It was big, yeah.    Stan Love: Yeah, and that's -- that's not crazy.  The interiors were too big.  No engineer is going to make, you know, a 12-foot vaulted ceiling in the gym.  You can get -- how high are you really get a bounce on that treadmill?  He'll do a 7 foot ceiling, it's going to save us a lot of math.    Host: Yeah.    Stan Love: But have that idea in your mind, something the size of the International Space Station is going to be our transit vehicle.  And, of course, we're not going to land that whole thing on Mars.  That guy's got to stay in orbit for a year while the crew is on the ground, which means it has to be super automated, which means the crew doesn't have to do anything to keep it running while it's in orbit around Mars for a year.  But then also, it doesn't need any help on the way out to Mars, so you now the crew doesn't have much to do.  And healthy and happy also means meaningfully occupied, so they don't just -- you're not just playing cards the whole way.    Host: Yes.    Stan Love: So, stuff for the crew to do during cruise before they get to Mars, and then on the way back to Earth is also going to be very important.  And these are problems that engineers aren't that interested in, they are human problems.  But I like to say the thing that makes human spaceflight interesting is that it has humans in it.  It's just not quite the same.  The robots are great, but it's even better when it's -- when it's a person, and the whole world can imagine what it would be like to be that person much better than they can imagine what it would be like to be that robot.    Host: That's all the questions we get really is like, you know, what is it like, what is your perspective change?  It's that human element of the traveling, not so much the engineering/ And the engineering, to me, is very interesting, but that human element is something that you can easily connect with because we're human.    Stan Love: Well, and it makes a difference.  I was a planetary scientist before I was an astronaut and I would go talk to school kids and they were kind of interested.    Host: Yeah.    Stan Love: And -- but I became an astronaut, I put on that blue suit, and those kids are really interested.    Host: That is huge, it really is.  It makes a huge impact.  So, one more thing I wanted to talk about before we let you go is, you know, we're talking about the Moon now, the Moon being sort of a stepping stone on the way to Mars and designing missions around that.  How can the Moon help us to explore even further?    Stan Love: Okay, I think this is an awesome idea.  The Moon is so much less hard than Mars.  It's so close.  If you burst your appendix, you can be home in four days, right?  It's also, I think, better from a public support standpoint.  Nobody can walk outside and identify Mars, except for a few astronomers and amateur astronomers.  Everybody can walk outside and identify the Moon.  And they can look up at that thing and they know exactly what it is, 3-year-old can identify it and think there are people living up there right now.  And maybe if -- you know, if they had a bright light on their station, if their part of the Moon was dark, you could look at a telescope and see that light, see there are people there are people living on that light.  Just the way right now, we can -- if you watch for the space station to go over, you know, every few weeks or so, your place will probably have a good ISS pass, and that big, bright star comes over.  And you can look at that say, people made that and people are living in that little star right now, it's a great feeling.  I love it.  I never get tired of it.  So, the Moon is more accessible to the public in their imagination, and what they can see, and Mars is so distant and abstract that it's tough.   Plus, it's 1,000 times further away than the Moon.  So, the Moon is close, it's big, it's familiar.  It is not quite as sexy as Mars, okay?  It's dry, there's no water, there's no polar caps, there's no weather.  Mars has polar caps and weather and more interesting stuff going on.  But the Moon is so much closer and effectively, I mean from an environment standpoint, you take your helmet off on the Moon, you're dead.  You take your helmet off on Mars, you're dead in about the same amount of time.  It's -- you know, from an environmental standpoint, it's quite similar.  The radiation problems are similar.  You have the extremes of temperature on the Moon, although Mars, cold winter night gets as cold as the Moon at night.  So, you have the hot days on the Moon that you have to deal with.  You don't have that atmosphere that you can make propellant with, that's a biggie.  The Moon is really just dry rocks and I can make oxygen out of those rocks, but the energy cost is enormous compared to the energy I need to crack oxygen out of Mars' air.  So, I have resource -- I have a little fewer resources.   The science is less interesting and the -- you know, just the vistas and the prospects are less planet like because that black sky and those alien landforms all made by impact instead of, you know, volcanoes and river valleys and stuff like that and polar caps like we have on Mars.  So, the Moon is not as sexy, but it's way closer, and it's way more accessible in every way.  The physics is going to drive us, I think, to the Moon before it allows us to go Mars.  And if we can get enough of an infrastructure on the Moon, that low gravity is going to make launch off the Moon trivial compared to launch off of the Earth.  Ae talked about this already.  So, why not build that Mars ship on the Moon and launching it is going to be easy and then off you go to Mars.    Host: Yes.  Oh, something to consider.    Stan Love: Yeah.    Host: All right, so we have like a couple more seconds, but I wanted to ask you one thing before we leave, is you're -- you seem so passionate and you know so much about traveling to other planets.  So, in your eyes, why is it important?  Why is it sort of our mission to send humans to explore the cosmos?    Stan Love: I think exploring is a natural human drive.  We do it, right?  When the ice age brought sea level down, people walked across the Bering Strait into North and South America.  And, you know, they wanted to see what was over that next hill or past that next river and they eventually peopled the entire Americas and so that the folks in the original continent forgot about them and were surprised when they landed in this new land and found people there already.  I also think exploration is one of the things we do that that brings out the best in us, as a species.  Many of the things that we invest a lot of our time and effort in are violent, or greedy, or both.  Exploration is a little tidier from a moral standpoint, especially if you're in a place that doesn't already have inhabitants.  We haven't always behaved well when we've found, you know, new places with people there already, Mars and Moon, we're safe there.  So, I think it makes us better.  I think it allows us to be the best of what humans can be.   And now that we have explored the Earth extremely thoroughly, only the ocean floor, deep caves, the upper atmosphere remain.  You know, we've climbed almost all the mountains, we've sailed all the seas, you know, there's -- and there's -- you know, a lot of those mounds have snack bars on the top of them now.  We, as a species, love to explore, it's built into us.  And the only places left now are the deep ocean and space.  And space will never end it.  It goes out as far as we can imagine and even further than even specially trained people can imagine.  So, we could keep exploring there forever and we'll never run out of new things to explore out there, so that's one of the things that made me a science-fiction fan as a kid, why I studied astronomy, why I became a planetary scientist.  When I had a chance to become an astronaut, I did it, flew in space.  And that's why I continue to study and work on a daily basis on making more of space accessible to more people.   I think we're at our best when we're doing that.    Host: I love it.  Let's go.  I'm so ready.    Stan Love: All right.  Well, thank you so much, Stan, for coming on and sharing this why Mars is hard, but then also your passion for space exploration, I love it.  Thank you so much.    Host: You're so welcome.  I was glad to do it.     [ Music ]    Pat Ryan:  Thanks for hanging in with us.  Today, Gary talked with astronaut and all around smart guy Stan Love about the problems being worked on right now so we can successfully send human beings to Mars in the years to come.  A heads up, you can hear more from Stan during the month of August.  He'll appear in a few episodes of a series of podcasts we're doing about the hazards of human spaceflight.  Part 1 of 5 in that series is slated to post August 10th.  I mentioned that this is episode 53 of our weekly podcast [inaudible] here at the Johnson Space Center, so the first episode of the second year of Houston, We Have a Podcast.  If you're new to the podcast, I recommend giving a listen to number 52, Houston, we Have a Birthday, where you can hear clips from many of the first year's shows and get a sense of the range of topics we're working to cover.  I can also recommend some other NASA podcasts, including Gravity Assist from NASA headquarters with Dr. Jim Green, he's one of the smartest guys ever, about Mars exploration and other topics of planetary science.   There's the new Rocket Ranch podcast from the NASA Kennedy Space Center.  Their first episode is about Mars too.  And don't forget the NASA in Silicon Valley podcast from our friends at the NASA Ames Research Center, where they talk about their research, including some of it that's taking place on the International Space Station.  Your home online for everything NASA is nasa.gov, including the latest on our deep-space exploration projects.  Please join us on your favorite social media platform.  You can find us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.  Use the hashtag ask NASA to submit a suggested topic.  Be sure to mention that it's for Houston, We Have a Podcast.  This episode was recorded on May 18, 2018.  Thanks to our audio wizard Alex Perryman, Kelly Humphries, Bill Stafford, Mel Whiting, and Brandi Dean, and our guest, Dr. Stan Love.  We'll be back next week.",

        description: '>> HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST! WELCOME TO THE OFFICIAL PODCAST OF THE NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, EPISODE 8, “EXPLORING THE COSMOS.” I’M GARY JORDAN AND I’LL BE YOUR HOST TODAY. SO THIS IS THE PODCAST WHERE WE BRING IN NASA EXPERTS, AND IN THE CASE OF TODAY’S EPISODE, SOME SUPER COOL SPACE FANATICS TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING NASA. SO TODAY WE HAD QUITE A FEW SPECIAL GUESTS. WE’RE TALKING ABOUT HUMAN SPACE EXPLORATION WITH GLENN LUTZ, JOHN CONNOLLY, AND THE BAND STYX. GLENN IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE EXPLORATION INTEGRATION AND SCIENCE DIRECTOR, OR EISD, HERE AT THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER. JOHN IS THE HEAD OF NASA’S MARS STUDY CAPABILITY TEAM UNDER EISD, AND STYX, WELL, STYX IS A ROCK BAND. WE TALKED TO TOMMY SHAW, WHO DOES GUITAR, VOCALS, AND A LOT OF THE WRITING, AND LAWRENCE GOWAN ON VOCALS AND KEYS AND ALSO DOES SOME OF THE WRITING, TOO. WHY IS A ROCK BAND HERE AT THE NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER? WELL, WE HAVE A LOT OF AMAZING THINGS TO SHOW OFF AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE COME OVER TO CHECK IT OUT. WE HAD A GREAT DISCUSSION ABOUT EXPLORING THE COSMOS, WHAT HUMAN EXPLORATION MISSIONS WILL LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE, AND WHY WE SEND HUMANS TO SPACE IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO, WITH NO FURTHER DELAY, LET’S GO LIGHTSPEED TO OUR TALK WITH MR. GLENN LUTZ AND MR. JOHN CONNOLLY, AS WELL AS MR. TOMMY SHAW AND MR. LAWRENCE GOWAN FROM STYX. ENJOY. [ MUSIC ] >> T MINUS FIVE SECONDS AND COUNTING! MARK!   [ INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ]  >> HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST.  [ MUSIC ] >> OKAY, SO HOW ARE YOU GUYS LIKING THE TOUR SO FAR? >> DO WE HAVE TO LEAVE? >> YEAH! >> IT’S A MIND BLOWER, IS WHAT IT IS. >> YEAH. >> IT’S A MIND BLOWER AND GETTING TO MEET PEOPLE THAT DO THIS EVERY DAY IS-- THAT’S AN HONOR AND THAT ALONE, AND THEN SEEING THEM WITH THE MACHINERY IS-- I CAN BARELY FORM WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW OVERWHELMING IT IS. >> WHAT MAKES IT SO OVERWHELMING, THOUGH? IS IT JUST THE HISTORY OR IS IT JUST THE AMOUNT OF STUFF, MAYBE? >> WELL, IT’S KIND OF EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW? >> OKAY. >> JUST FROM BEING A CHILD AND FROM-- I STILL REMEMBER SPUTNIK, AND SO I FOLLOWED IT-- MY FAMILY WOULD ALWAYS FOLLOW EVERYTHING THAT WENT ON. AND UP UNTIL MODERN TIMES NOW, I MEAN, ALL THROUGH OUR LIVES WE’VE WATCHED IT, AND THEN NOW TO DO-- WE DID A LITTLE STORY OURSELVES. >> YEAH! >> --ABOUT IT AND IT INVOLVES SOME-- TRYING TO GET IT RIGHT SO IT WOULD BE FEASIBLE, AND NOW TO SEE THESE-- THE HARDWARE THAT WE WERE JUST SORT OF IMAGINING. >> RIGHT. >> TO SEE THE ORION, THAT WAS AMAZING, TOO. BUT ALSO TO SEE THE CONTROL ROOM THAT WE’D ALL SEEN AS A CHILD. JUST REALLY, IT’S JUST KIND OF OVERWHELMING. >> YEAH! MISSION CONTROL, RIGHT? A LOT OF HISTORY THERE. LIKE, THIS--WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT ON THE BUS, RIGHT? JUST YOU-- YOU’RE JUST-- YOU’RE SITTING IN A ROOM AND YOU’RE THINKING ABOUT ALL THE GREAT THINGS THAT HAPPENED HERE. YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT LANDING ON THE MOON, YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT LEARNING HOW TO FLY HUMANS IN SPACE, ALL FROM THIS ROOM. >> YEAH, THE COMMAND CENTER, BASICALLY OF THE GREATEST HUMAN HISTORY THAT’S UNFOLDED IN OUR LIFETIME. >> YEAH. >> SO, TO BE AT THE EPICENTER OF THAT AND DRINK IN, AND AS TOMMY JUST POINTED OUT, IT’S SOMETHING WE’VE HAD SINCE WE WERE CHILDREN. >> RIGHT. >> SO, YOU’RE IN TOUCH WITH YOUR ENTIRE-- THIS MIGHT BE OVERLY PHILOSOPHIZING, BUT IT’S-- I CAN’T EVEN SPEAK. >> OVERLY PHILOSOPHICAL. >> OVERLY PHILOSOPHICAL. THANK YOU SO MUCH, GARY. I NEEDED THAT. >> IT’S THAT-- THAT’S WHAT I MEAN. THIS HAS BEEN A LONG DAY. YEAH! >> IT’S THIS WEIGHTLESSNESS CONDITION HERE. IT’S THE-- NO, YOU’RE IN TOUCH WITH ALL OF THAT AND THE FACT THAT YOU’RE SO CLOSE TO THIS-- WHAT IS THE GREATEST HUMAN ENDEAVOR IN OUR LIFETIME AND ALL OF THAT’S ENSUED BECAUSE OF IT. >> ABSOLUTELY. SO, WHAT WAS SO EXCITING, I THINK, FOR US, FROM OUR END, IS TO SHOW YOU NOT ONLY THE HISTORY OF KIND OF WHAT WE’VE BEEN DOING HERE AT THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER FOR SO LONG, BUT ALSO KIND OF WHAT WE’RE GOING TO DO, RIGHT? LIKE YOU SAID, WE’RE SHOWING YOU ORION, WE’RE SHOWING YOU EXPLORATION. WE’RE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT MARS, THE MOON, GOING BEYOND, GOING BEYOND THE LOW EARTH ORBIT, AND WE’RE KIND OF EXCITED TO SHOW YOU THAT. SO, I MEAN, JUST IN TERMS OF HUMAN EXPLORATION, JUST EXPLORING, GOING OUT, SEEING WHAT IS BEYOND. >> YEAH. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THAT DRIVE? WHY DO WE HAVE THIS DRIVE TO EXPLORE THE-- EXPLORE SPACE AS HUMANS? >> IT’S JUST-- IT’S HUMAN CURIOSITY. >> I THINK SO. >> WHAT ELSE IS THERE? WE’VE DONE THIS, YOU KNOW, WHAT’S OUT THERE? >> YEAH. >> AND WE KEEP FINDING OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE AND I’VE REALIZED HOW SERIOUS THE-- THAT QUEST IS HERE. BUT, FOR ALL THOSE QUESTIONS, THERE’S ALL THIS DETAIL AND ALL THIS RESEARCH AND WANTING TO GET IT RIGHT HERE SO THAT IT’S RIGHT WHEN YOU’RE OUT THERE. >> YEAH. >> JUST SEEING ALL THE MANPOWER AND ALL THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS KIND OF-- IT’S KIND OF MIND BOGGLING. >> IT’S WHAT-- IT’S THE MOST EXTREME EXAMPLE OF HOW HUMAN BEINGS HAVE THIS BUILT INTO OUR DNA, THIS-- WHAT ELSE, IS THE QUESTION. LIKE WHAT ELSE? >> YEAH. >> AND AS I’M WALKING THROUGH THERE, EVEN LOOKING AT THOSE-- ALL THOSE VARIOUS VEHICLES, IT’S LIKE WHAT ELSE COULD YOU DO WITH A VEHICLE THAT WOULD WORK IN A PLACE THAT WE DON’T KNOW ABOUT YET? SO, JUST-- I GUESS THAT’S REALLY ANOTHER THING THAT SEPARATES US FROM ANY OTHER FORM OF LIFE IS THAT WE’RE DRIVEN IN THAT WAY. NOT TO STAY SAFE, BUT TO DO THINGS THAT ARE RISKY AND HARD. I THINK I’M GOING TO START QUOTING JOHN KENNEDY OR CAPTAIN KIRK IN A MINUTE. ANYWAY, IT’S GREAT TO BE CLOSE TO-- >> YOU’RE ALLOWED TO DO THAT. >> ARE YOU? OKAY! >> BUT, I THINK MAYBE IT’S THAT HUMAN ELEMENT. RIGHT? IT’S THAT PASSION THAT REALLY DRIVES US. AND MAYBE IT’S KIND OF BUILT IN OUR DNA TO WANT TO EXPLORE. MAYBE THAT’S WHY WE SEND HUMANS. HUMANS CAN HAVE A STORY WHEN THEY EXPLORE THAT I DON’T THINK ROBOTS CAN. IT’S JUST-- IT’S THAT PERSONAL-- THE HUMAN ELEMENT THAT WE CONNECT WITH. >> WELL, THAT’S IT. WHAT WAS IT LIKE? >> YEAH. >> YOU CAN’T, NO MATTER HOW GREAT YOU’RE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS, IT CAN NEVER CONVEY EXACTLY WHAT WAS IT LIKE.  >> EXACTLY. >> AND SPEAKING TO DAN, ASTRONAUT DAN BURBANK, HE WAS ABLE TO, IN VERY SHORT ORDER, GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT THAT FELT LIKE. >> YEAH! >> YEAH. >> JUST FROM HIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. YOU CAN’T GET THAT FROM DATA, FROM A ROBOT OR SOMETHING. YOU FEEL WHAT HE’S FEELING, SORT OF. YOU’RE THERE. >> YEAH. AND WHEN HE DESCRIBES SOME OF WHAT HE HAD TO GO THROUGH TO DO IT, I’M GLAD I DIDN’T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT. SO I VICARIOUSLY ENJOY IT. >> WELL, WHAT I THINK WAS FANTASTIC-- SO TALKING ABOUT HUMAN EXPLORATION, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS KIND OF BRAND NEW OR JUST THINKING ABOUT IT. WE’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR A LONG TIME. IN FACT, WE HAVE PEOPLE HERE AT THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER DEDICATED TO THINKING ABOUT EXPLORATION. SO, I WANT TO FORMALLY INTRODUCE TWO FOLKS THAT WE HAVE WITH US TODAY, GLENN LUTZ AND JOHN CONNOLLY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. YOU ARE PART OF OUR EXPLORATION GROUP, IN A SENSE. SO, TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU GUYS DO. >> ALL RIGHT. WELL, WE ARE PUT IN PLACE TO DO JUST THAT-- TAKE US TO THOSE NEXT STEPS. >> MM-HMM. >> SO, JOHN’S IN CHARGE OF PUTTING OUT THE PLAN AND HE’S GOT A GROUP THAT’S MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED TO GO TO MARS IS THOUGHT ABOUT. >> MM-HMM. >> THERE’S NOT A CVS OR WALGREENS ON THE WAY TO STOP IN TO PICK UP SOMETHING. SO THESE GUYS ARE IN CHARGE OF PUTTING THAT WHOLE PLAN TOGETHER FROM THE NUMBER OF ROCKETS, HOW WE ARE GOING TO LIVE ON MARS. AND WE’VE GOT GUYS IN OUR GROUP THAT ARE WORKING ON TECHNOLOGY GAPS. WHAT WORKS TODAY AND WHAT’S-- WHAT WE NEED AND THERE’S A GAP, SO WE’RE CLOSING THEM, IN TESTING AND ET CETERA. OUR GROUP ALSO HAS THE SCIENTISTS IN IT. AND SO THEY’RE SAYING, “OKAY, WHY? WHY ARE WE GOING?” >> MM-HMM. >> AND WHERE? WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GO? TO THE MIXTURE THAT WE TAKE THE BEST ADVANTAGE OF WHERE WE’RE GOING. >> YEAH. >> SO, TOMMY MENTIONED THAT, YOU KNOW, AS KIDS WE ALL KIND OF WATCHED THE APOLLO PROGRAM, LOOKED UP IN THE SKY, SAW SPUTNIK, AND I THINK THAT’S WHAT GOT PEOPLE LIKE GLENN AND I HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. YOU KNOW? WE WERE TURNED ON BY THAT AND KIND OF MADE THAT OUR LIFE’S CALLING. AND WE’VE BEEN LOOKING AT HOW WE GET PEOPLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT, PERHAPS BACK TO THE MOON, PERHAPS ONTO MARS AS SOON AS WE CAN. AND THAT’S BECAUSE WE ALL THINK THAT HUMAN EXPLORATION IS A FUNDAMENTAL-- A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF BEING HUMAN, YOU KNOW, PUSHING OUTWARDS INTO THE STARS. AND SO, WE DO HAVE PLANS TO DO THAT. SO, THAT MISSION CONTROL THAT YOU SAW, WHERE WE DID ALL THOSE GREAT THINGS BACK YEARS AGO, THE BEST IS YET TO COME. ‘ >> SO, I MEAN, TOMMY AND LAWRENCE, JUST FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, JUST SEEING WHAT YOU SAW TODAY AND MAYBE THESE-- SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN TALKING TO YOU TODAY KIND OF GOT YOUR MIND JOGGING ABOUT MARS. AND YOU’VE THOUGHT ABOUT MARS IN THE PAST JUST FROM YOUR WRITING AND STUFF LIKE THAT. SO, IN TERMS OF MARS, WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT’S SO INTRIGUING? WHY WOULD WE WANT TO SEND HUMANS THERE? IN YOUR EYES. >> WELL, IT’S BEEN THE SUBJECT OF ALL DIFFERENT KIND OF CREATIVE WRITING, FROM MARTIAN CHRONICLES WHERE IT WAS LITERALLY LITTLE GREEN MEN TO THAT BOOK THAT BECAME THE MOVIE, “THE MARTIAN.” >> RIGHT. >> SO, IT’S REALLY BEEN-- CARTOONS FROM WHEN YOU’RE GROWING UP. THE LITTLE GREEN MEN AND MARS. AND YOU CAN-- AND IT STANDS OUT. IT’S DISTINCTIVE. AND THE NIGHTTIME SKY, IT IS RED. >> YEAH. >> DID GET TO SEE IT A LOT. AND I GUESS IT’S RELATIVELY CLOSE COMPARED TO WHAT ELSE IS OUT THERE. SO, IT’S ALL OF THOSE THINGS-- FROM FICTION TO FANTASY, AND REAL RESEARCH, AND ALL THOSE THINGS. WE’RE JUST FASCINATED BY IT. AND THE ONE THING THAT STRIKES ME IS JUST THE MORE WE SEE OF THINGS, HOW KIND OF SMALL AND INSIGNIFICANT WE ARE COMPARED TO WHAT WE THOUGHT OF WHEN WE WERE CHILDREN. THE WORLD JUST SEEMED SO MAGNIFICENTLY LARGE. AND I USED TO JUST LOOK UP AT THE CLOUDS AND GO, “HOW FAR UP IS THAT?” AND NOW, TO SEE WHAT YOU’RE PLANNING ON DOING HERE, IT’S AWESOME! >> I KNOW A LOT OF THE ASTRONAUTS. I’M NOT SURE IF DAN BURBANK BROUGHT IT UP, KIND OF IN HIS TALK, BUT THEY HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE OVERVIEW EFFECT. BEING UP 250 MILES, YOU HAVE THIS VIEW OF THE PLANET. YOU SEE THIS THIN LINE THAT’S AROUND THE PLANET THAT’S JUST PROTECTING US, AND THAT’S IT. AND YOU KIND OF HAVE EXACTLY WHAT YOU’RE SAY, THAT EFFECT OF, “WOW! WE ARE SO SMALL! THIS PLANET IS NOT AS BIG AS I THOUGHT!” >> YEAH. >> WE’RE ALL CONNECTED, BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE’S SO MUCH MORE TO THIS UNIVERSE AND TO THE EARTH, I GUESS. >> YEAH. >> AND SOMEONE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT BEING ON MARS AND LOOKING OUT AND NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND EARTH. >> YEAH. >> WHICH ONE OF THOSE IS EARTH? >> RIGHT. >> YEAH. >> IT’LL BE THE BLUE ONE, ACTUALLY. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PICK OUT EARTH, JUST LIKE WE COULD PICK OUT MARS IN THE SKY. EARTH WILL BE A LITTLE BRIGHTER, A LITTLE BLUER THAN ALL THE OTHER THINGS OUT THERE. >> SO, JOHN, THERE HAVE BEEN IMAGES FROM THE SURFACE OF MARS. CAN WE SEE THE EARTH? IS IT BLUE? >> YES, WE CAN. >> ALL RIGHT! >> YOU CAN SEE THE EARTH FROM MARS. WITH NOT MUCH HELP, YOU COULD ACTUALLY PICK OUT THE MOON NEXT TO IT. >> OH, WOW! >> SO-- >> WITH THE NAKED EYE? >> YEAH. SO, WHILE YOU’RE-- WELL, IT DEPENDS ON HOW GOOD YOUR EYES ARE. >> WELL, FROM THE-- YEAH. >> INSIDE A SPACESUIT. >> SO, YEAH, WHEN YOU’RE ON MARS, YOU’LL BE ABLE TO LOOK AT IT ALL. >> AMAZING. >> COMFY AND-- >> YEAH. SO, I MEAN, KIND OF BOUNCING OFF OF TOMMY’S POINT OF IT BEING IN OUR MIND TO EXPLORE MARS, FROM A PRACTICAL SENSE, FROM YOUR GUYS’ PERSPECTIVE IN THE EXPLORATION GROUP HERE AT THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, WHAT ARE WE THINKING ABOUT? WHY MARS? >> WELL, BECAUSE IT’S NEXT. IT’S THE NEXT LOGICAL PLACE TO SEND HUMANS. IT’S THE MOST EARTH-LIKE OF THE PLANETS. IT’S A PLACE THAT HAS INCREDIBLE SCIENTIFIC VALUE. IT MAY HAVE HARBORED LIFE IN THE PAST. IT MAY HARBOR LIFE STILL. THOSE ARE HUGE, HUGE QUESTIONS. THOSE ANSWERS, SOME OF THOSE BIG FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS THAT WE’VE HAD LIKE, ARE WE ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE? >> YEAH. >> AND IT’S ATTAINABLE, I THINK. MAYBE THAT’S THE BIGGEST REASON TO GO THERE IS BECAUSE WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY NOW, OR IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS, THAT WE COULD PUT TOGETHER A MISSION AND GO THERE. >> ACTUALLY, JOHN, I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU. >> YEAH. >> FROM WHAT WE HAD-- KNOW ABOUT MARS SO FAR, IS THERE ANY FOSSIL RECORD YET THAT-- WHERE THEY’VE GONE DOWN AND CHECKED? “WELL, HERE’S WHAT HAPPENED DURING THIS TIME,” AND HAVE THEY SEEN ANYTHING? >> SO, WE’VE ACTUALLY NOT REALLY EXPLORED THE Z-DIMENSION ON MARS. >> RIGHT. >> OKAY? WE’VE ROVED ACROSS THE SURFACE, AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT’S ON THE SCIENTIST’S PLANS IS TO GET A DRILL TO START DRILLING CORES. >> OH. >> AND LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THAT. PROBABLY THE ONLY FOSSIL WE MAY HAVE SEEN ARE SOME FOSSIL-- WHAT WE THOUGHT AT THE TIME WERE FOSSILIZED BACTERIA. BACK ABOUT 1997, THERE WERE A FEW FOLKS WHO THOUGHT THEY SAW SOME REMNANTS OF BACTERIA, VERY, VERY SMALL STUFF. >> RIGHT. >> BUT, WE HAVEN’T REALLY DRILLED DOWN TO FIND ANY TRILOBITES YET. >> RIGHT. BOY. >> SO, FROM A PLANNING PERSPECTIVE, IF YOU WERE TO PLAN-- THAT’S WHAT YOU’D DO? YOU THINK ABOUT PLANNING A MISSION TO MARS, RIGHT? WHAT ARE SOME OF THE KEY ELEMENTS THAT ARE VITAL TO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL MISSION TO GO TO MARS? >> SO, IT’S A PRETTY LONG LIST. SO, YOU NEED A PROPULSION SYSTEM THAT WILL ACCELERATE YOU OUT OF THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL OF EARTH. YOU NEED A HABITAT THAT’S RELIABLE ENOUGH TO TAKE YOU ON A SIX-MONTH TO TWELVE-MONTH TRIP TO MARS. YOU NEED A LANDING SYSTEM THAT WILL TAKE YOU THROUGH THE MARS ATMOSPHERE AND DOWN TO THE SURFACE. >> MM-HMM. >> YOU NEED ALL THE SURFACE EQUIPMENT, LIKE THE ROVERS THAT YOU GUYS WERE JUST IN, AND THE SPACESUITS, AND THE HABITATS, AND EQUIPMENT TO USE MARS RESOURCES. AND THEN YOU’D NEED A RIDE HOME. YOU’D NEED AN ASCENT VEHICLE TO GET YOURSELF BACK OFF THE SURFACE TO THE VEHICLE THAT’S GOING TO BRING YOU HOME AGAIN. AND SO, WHEN YOU PUT ALL THOSE TOGETHER, THERE’S A LOT OF PIECE PARTS THAT IT TAKES TO DO THAT MISSION. >> AMAZING. >> IS THAT TRUE FOR ANYWHERE WE WANT TO GO TO, RIGHT? YOU WOULD NEED SORT OF A SIMILAR PROFILE? >> SIMILAR. >> OKAY. >> THE MOON IS ACTUALLY A LITTLE EASIER THAN MARS TO GET TO. >> OH. >> YOU DON’T HAVE TO DEAL WITH AN ATMOSPHERE. >> OKAY. >> AND IT’S A LOT CLOSER, OF COURSE. >> YEAH. >> RIGHT NOW, THE MOON IS 250,000 MILES AWAY FROM US, MARS-- >> A LOT CLOSER. >> IT’S 250 MILLION MILES AWAY. >> OH, WOW! YEAH. >> IT’S AT ITS FURTHEST POINT FROM US RIGHT NOW. IT’S ACTUALLY HIDDEN BEHIND THE SUN. SO, IF YOU WERE ON MARS RIGHT NOW, WE COULDN’T TALK TO YOU. >> OH. COULDN’T AT ALL? BECAUSE IT GETS THE COMMUNICATION? >> YEAH, FOR A WEEK OR TWO, YOU’RE HIDDEN BEHIND THE SUN AND WE LITERALLY CAN’T TALK TO YOU. >> THAT LONG? A WEEK OR TWO? >> YEAH. >> WOW! SO, WHAT’S-- I’M GUESSING YOU’RE PLANNING FOR THAT, RIGHT? >> OF COURSE. >> SO, WHAT WOULD BE-- IN THE SITUATION WHERE THAT WERE THE CASE, RIGHT? YOU HAVE FOLKS ON MARS AND THEY DON’T HAVE COMMUNICATION WITH FOLKS ON EARTH FOR A WEEK. WHAT ARE THEY DOING? >> LISTENING TO STYX. >> THEY COULD BE LISTENING TO MUSIC. >> WELL, WHAT WAS IT-- IN “THE MARTIAN”, WHAT WAS THE THING? IT WAS-- >> IT WAS “HAPPY DAYS” ON THE MOVIE, BUT IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE IN THE BOOK. >> WE’VE GOT SOMETHING WAY BETTER THAN THAT. >> SO, OUR ROBOTIC MISSIONS THAT ARE THERE NOW, WE PUT THEM KIND OF INTO A SAFE MODE FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS. >> OH, OKAY. >> WE JUST DON’T HAVE THEM DO VERY MUCH. AND IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS, WE HAVE THEM START BROADCASTING UNTIL WE PICK THEM UP AGAIN. SO, THE CREW WOULD PROBABLY HAVE-- PROBABLY HAVE ABOUT TWO WEEKS OFF, I’D SAY, WHERE THEY DON’T-- WHERE THEY PROBABLY WOULDN’T DO VERY MUCH. >> WOW. >> DO YOU THINK THE ACTUAL SHOT TO GO TO MARS WILL LAUNCH FROM THE MOON OR FROM EARTH? >> SO, ULTIMATELY, EVERYTHING STARTS FROM EARTH. THE QUESTION IS, WHAT’S THE MIDPOINT? >> RIGHT. >> SO, WHERE DO YOU ACTUALLY ASSEMBLE VEHICLES AND THINGS LIKE THAT? >> RIGHT. >> ENERGETICALLY, IT ACTUALLY MAKES MORE SENSE TO ASSEMBLE THINGS IN SPACE RATHER THAN ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON. SO, YOU COULD DO THAT IN LUNAR ORBIT. >> RIGHT. >> YOU COULD DO THAT IN A VERY HIGH EARTH ORBIT, BUT IN SPACE MAKES THE MOST SENSE. RIGHT AT THE EDGE OF LEAVING THE EARTH’S SPHERE OF INFLUENCE, THE EARTH’S-- THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD OF THE EARTH, THEN JUST TAKES A LITTLE KICK FROM THERE TO KICK YOU OUT TO MARS. >> HUH. >> BUT YOU DON’T WANT TO-- YOU DON’T WANT TO GO INTO A GRAVITY FIELD LIKE DOWN TO THE LUNAR SURFACE BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE TO FIGHT YOUR WAY OUT OF THAT AGAIN. >> OH, RIGHT. >> SO, WHAT WOULD YOU BE BUILDING AROUND THE-- >> WELL, WE’RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON SOME PLANS FOR BUILDING, FOR EXAMPLE, THE TRANSPORT THAT TAKES CREWS FROM THE VICINITY OF THE EARTH TO MARS ORBIT. >> HUH. >> AND SO, THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS YOU CAN’T LAUNCH IN ONE LAUNCH BECAUSE THEY’RE TOO BIG. SO, YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM TOGETHER SOMEWHERE. >> RIGHT. >> AND ANYWHERE IN CISLUNAR SPACE KIND OF MAKES SENSE TO DO THAT. >> OKAY. INTERESTING. >> SO IT SEEMS LIKE A COORDINATED MISSION, A VENTURE WITH LOTS OF ADVANCED THINGS. SO, YOU HAVE ALL THE HARDWARE. >> YEAH, IT’S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF LAUNCHES TO PUT PIECES TOGETHER AND GET THOSE THINGS SEQUENCED OUT TO MARS IN A WAY THAT HAS WHAT YOU NEED ON MARS WHEN YOU NEED IT. >> AND THAT IT’S UP THERE AND OPERATIONAL BEFORE WE SAY, “OKAY, GUYS, IT’S TIME TO COMMIT CREW TO GO MEET THEM.” >> RIGHT. >> SO, DO YOU THINK THERE WOULD EVER BE A TIME WHERE-- WHEN YOU GET ALL THAT WORKED OUT SO YOU-- IT’S JUST SECOND NATURE, THIS IS HOW YOU DO THAT? TO EXTEND THAT TO MARS SO YOU’RE BUILDING THINGS IN MARS TO GO BEYOND THERE? >> I THINK IF WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT ON MARS, THAT’LL BE THE NEXT GIANT LEAP, IF YOU WILL. AND THAT’LL TEACH US A LOT ABOUT SURVIVING WITHOUT BEING DEPENDENT ON EARTH. AND I THINK THAT’S THE NEXT BIG STEP. >> IT GOES BACK TO YOUR FIRST COMMENT THAT EVEN AS LITTLE KIDS, YOU SEE THE 2-YEAR-OLD, THE NEXT THING THAT’S JUST OUT OF HIS REACH, SO IF WE GET TO MARS, THAT WOULD BE THE NEXT THING JUST OUT OF OUR REACH. >> SO, TOMMY, KIND OF THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT BIG STEP. IF-- THINKING WAY OUT IN THE FUTURE, IN YOUR MIND, WHAT WOULD KIND OF BE SOME OF THE NEXT PLACES THAT WOULD BE REALLY COOL TO SEE? BEYOND MARS. >> WELL, WE HAVE SORT OF A SELFISH-- >> I KNOW WHERE YOU’RE GOING HERE. >> ON THE AGENDA. >> YES. IT WOULD JUST BE STARTED UPON THE BAND’S NAME OF THE FIFTH MOON OF PLUTO. AND WE’VE ACTUALLY SEEN PICTURES OF IT AND IT’S NOT THE GREATEST LOOKING. IF YOU WERE GOING TO VACATION ANYWHERE IN THE AREA, WE’D GO TO PLUTO, JUST MAYBE TAKE SOME SNAPSHOTS. >> YEAH, TO SEE IF FROM THE SURFACE. >> I DON’T KNOW. I THINK WITH A LITTLE WORK WE COULD BUFF IT UP AND MAKE IT A HOLIDAY DESTINATION. IT’S A FIXER-UPPER, THERE’S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. >> IT’S A HANDYMAN’S DREAM. >> IT’S ABOUT THE SIZE OF DOWNTOWN CHICAGO, BY THE WAY. >> IS IT? >> YEAH. >> IT’S NOT TOO BIG. >> YEAH, IT’S NOT THAT BIG. >> CHICAGO’S NICE. >> YEAH. YEAH. >> A FROZEN CHICAGO. >> IN AN UNBIASED OPINION. >> I DON’T THINK IT HAS THE WATERFRONT. >>  [ INDISTINCT ].  >> YEAH. >> IT’S COME A LONG WAY SINCE THE WORLD’S FAIR. >> YEAH. >> THERE YOU GO. >> ANOTHER THING THAT-- BACK TO WHERE WE WERE STARTING-- >> YEAH? >> THAT BLOWS MY MIND, WHEN I KEEP THINKING THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT ONE OF THE AIRPORTS WE GO THROUGH, I THINK IT’S ST. LOUIS, IS THAT THE ONE THAT’S NEAR KITTY HAWK OR WHERE THE WRIGHT BROTHERS? >> SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS. >> YEAH. >> SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS. >> IS THAT IT?  >> MM-HMM. >> OKAY. SO, I’M THINKING HUMAN FLIGHT, IT STILL BOGGLES MY MIND. IT’S JUST OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND NOW WE’RE TALKING ABOUT ASSEMBLING THINGS IN SPACE THAT CAN REACH, YOU KNOW, THE NEXT PLANET. SO, THAT’S BACK TO ME, KIND OF BEING MIND BLOWING. >> YEAH. I THINK THAT’S MORE OF LIKE THE DOING ASPECT, RIGHT? SO, LIKE, YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE WE’VE BEEN DREAMERS FOR SO LONG. >> YEAH. >> AND WE’RE DREAMING ABOUT THE COSMOS, AND BASED ON OUR LIMITED KNOWLEDGE, HAVE COME UP WITH THESE FANTASTICAL REALITIES OF WHAT IT COULD BE, BUT THEN ONCE WE REALIZE THAT, YOU KNOW, WE CAN GO INTO SPACE AND WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO DO IT, AND YOU ACTUALLY BUILD IT AND DO IT, THAT’S A WHOLE NEW-- >> WELL, THAT’S WHY MEETING GUYS LIKE THIS IS SO-- >> YEAH! >> --AMAZING FOR US. YEAH. >> ALL RIGHT. SO, ALL RIGHT, GOING WAY BACK OUT TO PLUTO. YOU HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF ACTUALLY SEEING NEW HORIZONS, RIGHT? WHEN IT ACTUALLY TOOK PHOTOS OF PLUTO. >> WE WERE INVITED-- WE HAPPENED TO BE IN THE D.C. AREA THE DAY THAT THEY DID THEIR FLY-BY AND WE WERE INVITED OUT AND WE GOT TO MEET THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR, ALAN STERN, AND ALL OF HIS PEOPLE. AND THEY WERE WAITING THERE FOR US. I’LL NEVER FORGET, THEY WERE THERE-- THEY HAD A BANNER AND THEY HAD ALL KIND OF GATHERED IN A ROOM KIND OF LIKE THIS >> YEAH. >> AND THEY WERE WELCOMING US AND WE DIDN’T KNOW WHO THEY ARE. WE’D NEVER MET THEM BEFORE. >> SURE. >> WE KNEW WE WERE AT THEIR MISSION CONTROL, BUT-- SO, LITTLE BY LITTLE, WE STARTED GETTING INTRODUCED. IT’S LIKE GUYS LIKE YOU WITH THESE-- WHO’VE DONE THIS AMAZING THING AND WE REALIZE, THIS IS ALL BACKWARDS. WE NEED TO HAVE A BANNER FOR YOU. >> YEAH, EXACTLY. >> IT WAS LIKE THE WE’RE NOT WORTHY KIND OF THING. >> IT WAS LIKE THERE THEY’D WON THEIR SUPER BOWL AND THE CULMINATION OF A NINE-YEAR MISSION. IT WAS WHEN THEY WERE GET-- AS THESE PICTURES WERE COMING THROUGH, WE WERE AMONG THE FIRST PEOPLE, EARTHLINGS, TO SEE THIS-- TO SEE THIS UNFOLD. ACTUALLY, YOU JUST REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING WEIRD ABOUT THAT DAY THAT I REMEMBERED. I REMEMBER US GETTING LOST ON THE WAY TO GET INTO THE THING. >> WE COULDN’T FIND OUR WAY THERE. >> WE COULDN’T FIND OUR WAY THERE! AND THEY SPENT NINE YEARS GETTING TO PLUTO. >> WE MET THE NAVIGATOR WHO DID THE-- >> WHO ACTUALLY FLEW IT. >> YES. >> YES. >> WOW. SO, HOW DID HE DESCRIBE THAT RIDE? WAS IT LIKE-- I GUESS IT’S A PRETTY INTRICATE RIDE TO GET ALL THE WAY OUT THERE. >> THE ONLY THING I REMEMBER IS THAT HE SAID IT WAS-- THE CRAFT ITSELF WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BABY GRAND PIANO. >> YEAH. >> SO, DIRECTING THAT THROUGH, YOU KNOW, ALL THAT DISTANCE, YOU KNOW? AND IT’S, I GUESS IT’S THE FARTHEST WE’VE GONE, RIGHT? SO, IT WAS THE FARTHEST WE’VE EVER SENT ANYTHING, I SUPPOSE. AM I RIGHT? >> I THINK VOYAGER. >> OH, VOYAGER’S EVEN FURTHER. >> YEAH. >> IT GOT A HEAD START. >> OKAY. >> YEAH. >> BUT IT NEVER TOOK PICTURES OF PLUTO. >> ALL RIGHT! >> YEAH. >> WELL, I DON’T’ WANT TO PUT ANYTHING-- I DON’T WANT TO PUT VOYAGER DOWN IN ANY WAY, BUT TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THAT WITH SOMETHING-- OH, I REMEMBER. ONE QUESTION I ASKED THAT DAY WAS, “ISN’T IT LIKELY THAT IT’S GOING TO BE HIT BY SOMETHING OUT THERE?” BECAUSE I’M ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, I WAS ASKING DAN ABOUT THAT, AS WELL. AND ONE OF THE SCIENTISTS THERE EXPLAINED TO ME THAT WE-- IT TAKES A LONG TIME BEFORE THE CONCEPT OF HOW VAST SPACE IS FINALLY SINKS IN, THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF ACTUALLY COLLIDING WITH SOMETHING IS SO MINISCULE. >> MM-HMM. >> THAT IT’S INCREDIBLY UNLIKELY. AND TO MY MIND, IT SEEMS LIKE, I DON’T KNOW, WOULDN’T THAT BE HAPPENING ALL THE TIME? AND APPARENTLY IT DOESN’T HAPPEN VERY MUCH AT ALL. >> EVEN THE ASTEROID BELT, I THINK, IS A GOOD EXAMPLE, RIGHT? HOW FAR-- HOW CLOSE ARE SOME OF THE CLOSEST THINGS IN THE ASTEROID BELT? >> WELL, NOT AS CLOSE AS THE STAR WARS MOVIES PORTRAY THEM. >> THAT’S WHAT I’M THINKING. I’M THINKING HAN SOLO GOING THROUGH, YEAH. >> SO, PEOPLE THINK OF, YOU KNOW, ASTEROID BELTS AND THE KUIPER BELT AS BEING THIS SORT OF ROCK PILE IN SPACE. >> YES. >> AND IT’S, YOU KNOW, LITERALLY MILLIONS OF MILES BETWEEN LITTLE SPECKS OF THINGS. >> YEAH. SO, IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT STUFF IN THE KUIPER BELT IS EVEN FARTHER AWAY? LIKE, ARE WE TALKING ABOUT-- >> OH YEAH. SO, THAT’S OUT BEYOND PLUTO. >> YEAH. >> ONE OF THE THINGS I’VE HEARD IS THAT WE COULD LAND ON AN ASTEROID, THOUGH. >> WE WERE WORKING-- WE HAVE THAT TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. >> IN FACT, THERE’S ONE OF OUR ESA BRETHREN ACROSS THE POND, THEY DID LAND ON A COMET. >> OH, REALLY? >> WHEN WAS THAT? >> JUST RECENTLY. BUT WE’VE-- WE WERE WORKING MISSIONS TO PUT DOWN ON AN ASTEROID AND SEE WHAT’S THERE. WE’VE MADE SOME COURSE DIRECTIONS AND NOW ARE MORE FOCUSED ON MARS. >> ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT A HUMAN MISSION? >> NO, IT WAS A ROBOTIC MISSION TO THE ASTEROID-- >> OKAY. >> --TO BRING BACK THE PIECE SO WE COULD STUDY IT HERE. >> OH, GOT IT. >> AROUND THE MOON. >> OKAY. OKAY. >> YOU COULD LAND ON THE ASTEROID, BUT IT HAS ALMOST NO GRAVITY. >> MORE LIKE RENDEZVOUS. >> YEAH. AND MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT THE MOONS OF MARS ARE CAPTURED ASTEROIDS. SO, PHOBOS AND DEIMOS. YOU COULD GO THERE. VERY LITTLE GRAVITY TO HOLD YOU ON THE SURFACE, THOUGH. >> OH. >> SO, THAT MAKES IT A LITTLE EASIER TO GET TO, SO YOU DON’T HAVE THAT GRAVITY WELD HE WAS TALKING ABOUT TO TRY AND EXTRACT YOURSELF FROM. >> RIGHT. >> OH, OKAY, SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY JUST-- WOULD YOU, IN A SCENARIO IF YOU WERE TO VISIT PHOBOS, RIGHT? IF-- WOULD YOU LAND ON PHOBOS AND THEN LAUNCH OFF AGAIN? OR WOULD YOU DO SORT OF AN ORBITAL THING. >> OR ANCHOR, RIGHT? >> ANCHOR, OKAY. >> YEAH, YOU COULD DO EITHER. YOU WOULD KIND OF DOCK WITH IT. >> YEAH. >> OH! >> YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IT WOULD JUST BE KIND OF ANOTHER THING FLOATING IN SPACE. >> AHH, SO, YOU’D ACTUALLY HAVE TO-- BY LANDING IT’S MORE LIKE GRABBING US. >> MORE LIKE THE BOAT IN THE PIER. >> OH. >> NEXT TO THE TIE-ON. DO WHATEVER EXPLORATION YOU COULD DO, PLANT THE FLAG. >> OKAY. VERY COOL. SO, I KNOW KIND OF GOING BACK, YOU KNOW, THINKING ABOUT JUST EXPLORING JUST DIFFERENT HEAVENLY BODIES, RIGHT? TALK ABOUT PHOBOS OR EVEN IF YOU WERE TO LAND ON STYX, RIGHT? THERE’S SOMETHING THAT WE LIKE TO CALL ISRU. THAT’S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT KIND OF WE’RE LOOKING AT. IN-SITU RESOURCE UTILIZATION, RIGHT? >> THERE YOU GO. >> IT’S USING THE STUFF THAT’S THERE TO CREATE MORE STUFF AND, I GUESS, IS THE VERY LAYMAN WAY OF SAYING THAT. >> RIGHT. >> SO, IF IT WAS RESOURCES. >> LIVING OFF THE LAND. >> LIVING OFF THE LAND! >> THAT’S A GOOD LAYMAN WAY OF PUTTING IT. >> THERE YOU GO. VERY COOL. SO, WHERE ARE SOME OF THE BEST PLACES WHERE YOU CAN LIVE OFF THE LAND THAT WE KNOW OF IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM? >> WELL, MARS IS PROBABLY THE EASIEST. MARS HAS AN ATMOSPHERE. >> AH. >> I MEAN, IT’S CARBON DIOXIDE. YOU COULD EASILY CRAFT CARBON DIOXIDE INTO OXYGEN AND CARBON MONOXIDE AND USE THE OXYGEN TO BREATHE, OR TO MAKE MOST OF YOUR ROCKET FUEL. >> HMM. >> AND, IN FACT, WE HAVE AN EXPERIMENT FLYING IN 2020 TO MARS THAT’S GOING TO TEST EXACTLY THAT. SO, THAT-- AND IF THAT WORKS, AND IT SHOULD BECAUSE IT’S VERY SIMPLE CHEMISTRY, THAT MEANS THAT WE-- >> KNOCK ON WOOD. >> YOU DON’T NEED TO TAKE EVERYTHING WITH YOU ANYMORE. WHEN WE WENT TO THE MOON ORIGINALLY, WE TOOK EVERYTHING WE NEEDED. EVERY PIECE OF FOOD, EVERY BREATH OF OXYGEN, EVERY OUNCE OF WATER. IF YOU FIND THAT KIND OF STUFF ON PLANETS, THAT REALLY CHANGES THE EQUATION ENTIRELY BECAUSE NOW YOU’RE LIVING OFF THE LAND, YOU’RE LIVING OFF THE RESOURCES OF THOSE PLANETS. >> AND DO YOU THINK IT’S POSSIBLE TO ADD NUTRIENTS AND NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS OR WHATEVER IT TOOK TO PLANT-- >> POTATOES? >> POTATOES.  >> PERHAPS. >> OR BEANS, OR CORN, OR WHATEVER. >> YEAH. >> YOU STILL NEED OXYGEN, THOUGH. >> WELL, YEAH, YOU NEED A LOT OF THINGS. SO, MARS’ SOIL HAS SOME OF THE THINGS YOU NEED FOR GROWING THINGS. YOU’D HAVE TO ADD NUTRIENTS AND YOU’D HAVE TO WASH A FEW OF THE OTHER THINGS OUT OF THE SOIL FIRST. >> RIGHT. >> BUT, YEAH, YOU COULD-- YOU COULD, WITH ENOUGH ADDITIVES, GROW STUFF IN MARS SOIL. >> SO, YOU COULD MAKE FUEL AND FOOD. >> YEP. >> 3D PRINTERS. THESE-- I HAVEN’T READ ENOUGH ABOUT THEM, BUT IS THAT PART OF WHAT IT IS? YOU TAKE THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE THERE AND YOU’RE ABLE TO FABRICATE SOMETHING THAT-- WHATEVER IS NECESSARY NEXT? OR IS THAT-- WHERE IS THAT? >> YEAH, I THINK 3D PRINTERS ARE ON THE STATION TODAY, SO, WE CAN BUILD-- IF SOMETHING BREAKS, WE DON’T HAVE TO WAIT TO FLY UP A PART. WE CAN BUILD IT. >> OKAY. >> THE PART. 3D PRINTERS FOR THE FUEL THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT, I THINK FUEL IS MORE OF A CHEMICAL ELEMENT THING. >> YEAH. >> SO, WE WOULDN’T REALLY PRINT ANYTHING, BUT WE WOULD CRAFT IT. >> WE ARE LOOKING, ACTUALLY, AT 3D PRINTERS TO TAKE-- LIKE THE SOIL, YOU COULD FIND ON MARS. >> YEAH. >> AND, YOU KNOW, YOU ADD SOME ADDITIVES TO IT AND YOU USE THE SOIL TO BUILD HABITATS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. IT WOULD BE A BIG-SCALE 3D PRINTER. THERE’S SOME NASA TECHNOLOGY GOING ON AT SOME OF OUR CENTERS TO LOOK AT THAT. SO, I THINK 3D PRINTING IS IN ITS INFANCY. AND WE HAVEN’T REALLY EVEN EXPLORED ALL THE COOL THINGS WE COULD DO WITH IT. >> YEAH. >> SO, YOU COULD MAKE A METAL ALLOY KIND OF A THING. >> SURE. THERE ARE ALREADY METAL 3D PRINTERS. >> OR EVEN AN EARTHEN PLACE TO LIVE IN. >> YEAH. >> YEAH. >> OUT OF THE SOIL YOURSELF. >> THAT’S WHAT I MEAN. >> YEAH. >> THAT YOU-- THE ELEMENTS ARE THERE TO BUILD IT. >> RIGHT. >> SO, YOU COULD ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, CONSTRUCT SOMETHING BY BASICALLY DOING-- IT’S DOING THE MINING AND THE MANUFACTURING. >> AND IT HELPS IN A LOT OF WAYS IN THAT RADIATION IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR THE HUMAN BEING. >> RIGHT. >> AND THE EARTH’S ATMOSPHERE PROTECTS US. WE’RE LEAVING THAT BEHIND. >> OH, RIGHT. >> TO GO TO THESE OTHER PLACES. >> YEAH. >> SO, IF WE CAN’T BUILD OUT OF EARTH LIKE THEY USED TO DO IN WYOMING, OKLAHOMA, BUILD THE SOD HOUSES, SO TO SPEAK. THAT HELPS FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE AS WELL. >> HMM. >> TO HAVE ADDED PROTECTION THAN JUST THE SPHERICAL DOME THAT WE WOULD TAKE WITH US. >> I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. >> AND ALL THE TECHNOLOGY IS ALMOST THERE, OR PRETTY MUCH THERE, ISN’T IT? >> FOR BUILDING HOUSES THROUGH 3D PRINTERS? >> WELL, FOR DOING ALL THOSE THINGS. IF YOU GET YOURSELF ON THE SITE. >> IT’S HIS JOB TO MAKE SURE IT IS. >> BUT IT’S-- >> SO, IT DOESN’T SEEM THAT OUTRAGEOUS >> NO, NO, NOT AT ALL. THAT’S WITHIN THE REALM OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE COULD HAVE IN THE TIMEFRAMES WE’RE LOOKING AT TO GO TO MARS. >> IS THERE ANY SORT OF “I WISH I HAD’S,” THAT YOU GUYS ARE THINKING OF? >> I WISH I HAD BETTER PROPULSION. >> AHH. >> BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, AS A SPECIES, WE ARE STUCK IN THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM. >> HMM. >> BECAUSE THE BEST WE HAVE IS CHEMICAL PROPULSION. YOU KNOW, WE’VE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY A LITTLE BIT SINCE APOLLO, BUT-- AND WE HAVE THINGS LIKE ELECTRIC PROPULSION NOW, BUT WE NEED SOME SORT OF DIFFERENT PROPULSION SYSTEMS, SOME SORE OF NEW PHYSICS TO REALLY TRAVEL AMONGST THE STARS OR REALLY TO GET OUT OF THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM. >> YEAH. >> SO, THAT’S MY BIG “I WISH I HAD.” >> SO, WITH CHEMICAL PROPULSION, REALISTICALLY, IF YOU-- IF YOU DESIGNED A MISSION TO GO LIKE WAY OUT IN THE EDGE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM, HOW LONG IS THAT MISSION PROFILE? TO GO OUT TO THE EDGE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND BACK. >> OH, MAN. >> OUTSIDE. >> YEAH, IT WOULD BE A MULTI-GENERATIONAL MISSION. >> YEAH. WOW. >> AND THAT’S THE PROBLEM WITH CHEMICAL PROPULSION. IT JUST-- IT’S JUST NOT GOING TO PUSH YOU FAST ENOUGH TO GET WHERE YOU WANT TO GO. BY THE TIME YOU GOT THERE, ANOTHER SPACECRAFT WOULD RACE PAST YOU WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY. >> RIGHT. >> WOULDN’T IT BE NICE WHERE YOU COULD JUST FLIP A SWITCH AND JUST, “I’M GOING LIGHT SPEED,” AND THEN, BAM! >> CAN YOU SPECULATE ON WHAT WOULD EXIST OTHER THAN CHEMICAL PROPULSION THEN? >> WELL, SO IF-- SO RIGHT NOW WE USE, YOU KNOW, WE COMBINE CHEMICALS, WE USE-- WE ACCELERATE IONS TO PUSH OURSELVES AROUND. THAT ALL REQUIRES US TO HAVE A FUEL. OKAY? THAT WE SOMEHOW ACCELERATE OFF-- OUT THE BACK-END OF A ROCKET. THE REAL-- THE NEXT BIG STEP IN PHYSICS WOULD COME IF YOU FIND A WAY WHERE YOU DON’T NEED FUEL, THAT YOU COULD SOMEHOW CREATE FORCE WITHOUT FUEL. >> RIGHT. >> AND THERE ARE SOME TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS AT NASA GOING ON RIGHT NOW THAT ARE LOOKING AT THAT. IF YOU’RE A BIG FAN OF “STAR TREK,” THAT’S KIND OF WHAT WARP DRIVE IS ALL ABOUT. >> YEAH. >> CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT FOR ME? >> THAT WOULD-- I WOULD LOVE TO GET ANOTHER PODCAST. >> I READ SOMETHING ON AN ASTRONOMY SITE THAT I SOMEHOW LINK TO NOW ON FACEBOOK ABOUT SOME EXPERIMENTAL PROPULSION THING WHERE-- BECAUSE YOU’RE GENERALLY-- YOU’RE PUSHING OFF OF SOMETHING TO GO THE OTHER DIRECTION AND THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW THAT THEY WERE-- I DON’T KNOW IF THESE PLATES OR SOMETHING THAT SOMEHOW CREATED PROPULSION. >> YEAH, AND THAT’S THE NEW PHYSICS I’M TALKING ABOUT. WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO GET THAT WORKING. AND WE DO HAVE AN ENGINEER HERE IN HOUSTON WHO’S WORKING ON A PROPULSION SYSTEM LIKE THAT. THEY-- SOME PEOPLE CALL IT THE QUANTUM THRUSTING. >> YES. >> IT PUSHES-- AND THEY DON’T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY IT WORKS, BUT IT’S BEEN TRIED A COUPLE PLACES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND IT’S AT THE POINT WHERE YOU HAVE TO BE VERY SKEPTICAL ABOUT WHAT’S GOING ON. AND-- BUT IF IT WORKS, IT COULD CHANGE THE WHOLE EQUATION BECAUSE IT DOESN’T NEED FUEL. IT’S USING DIFFERENT FORCES THAT SOMEHOW IS PUSHING AGAINST SOMETHING AND MOVING IT. >> WELL THEN-- >> AGAIN, ANOTHER PODCAST. >> WE HEAR ABOUT GRAVITY ASSIST, RIGHT? >> MM-HMM. >> OKAY, SO, I MEAN, IS IT SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE? WHERE THERE’S SOME MAGNETIC EXCHANGE? >> NO, IT’S A LITTLE DIFFERENT. GRAVITY ASSIST IS-- THAT’S BASICALLY CAPTURING THE ENERGY OF A PLANET LIKE EARTH OR VENUS AND TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF THAT PLANET’S ENERGY AND TURNING IT INTO YOUR ENERGY AS YOU FLY BY. >> YEAH. >> AND WHAT’S GOOD ABOUT ROLLER DERBY AROUND THE EDGE, YOU GET A LITTLE ASSIST AROUND THE EDGE. >> YEAH. >> WHAT’S GOOD ABOUT GRAVITY ASSIST, AND CORRECT ME IF I’M WRONG, BUT IT’S A GOOD BANG FOR YOUR BUCK. YOU DON’T PUT A LOT OF ENERGY INTO IT AND WHAT YOU GET OUT OF THAT GRAVITY ASSIST IS A REALLY BIG BOOST. >> RIGHT. IN FACT, MOST OF THE TIMES YOU DON’T PUT ANY ENERGY INTO IT. >> OH, WOW! >> GET CAPTURED.  >> BUT WHAT YOU’RE DOING IS YOU’RE BORROWING A LITTLE BIT OF ENERGY FROM THAT PLANET’S ORBIT. >> THAT’S INCREDIBLE. >> YEAH. >> SO, KIND OF THINKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, GOING BACK TO MARS FOR A SECOND. SO, BACK TO A MARS MISSION. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT TO PUT HUMANS ON THE SURFACE, TO MAKE IT, I GUESS, FRIENDLY? >> FRIENDLY? >> HUMAN FRIENDLY. WHAT ARE THE THINGS WE’D HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT? >> WELL, GLENN COULD TALK MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SPACE SUITES AND EVA. >> YEAH. >> BUT, FROM MY STANDPOINT, GETTING PEOPLE TO THE SURFACE. SO, IT’S ALL A MATTER OF CHANGING VELOCITIES, FIRST OF ALL, RIGHT? YOU HAVE TO LEAVE EARTH. YOU HAVE TO RIDE A BIG ROCKET. YOU THEN HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR VELOCITY ENOUGH TO THROW YOU OUT TOWARDS MARS. THEN YOU HAVE TO SLOW DOWN ONCE YOU GET TO MARS AND MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE AND SLOW DOWN ENOUGH SO THAT BY THE TIME YOU GET TO THE SURFACE, YOUR RELATIVE VELOCITY IS ZERO. SO, ALL THAT-- ALL THOSE MIRACLES OF ROCKET PROPULSION AND ENTRY SYSTEMS THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN KEEP ME UP AT NIGHT. OKAY? THEN ONCE YOU GET TO THE SURFACE, YOU NEED SUPER RELIABLE SYSTEMS, BECAUSE AT MARS, LIKE YOU SAID, YOU DON’T HAVE A 7-ELEVEN NEXT DOOR. YOU DON’T HAVE A HANDYMAN YOU COULD CALL. YOU CAN’T SEND A SOYUZ OR A PROGRESS UP IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS WITH SOME NEW PARTS. SO, EVERYTHING HAS TO WORK FOR THE DURATION OF THE TIME YOU’RE THERE OR YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FIX IT. AND SO, IT’S THAT SUPER HIGH RELIABILITY. >> YEAH. I THINK ANY ENDEAVOR ACROSS CIVILIZATION, THE LOGISTICS, LOGISTICS JUST GETS TO ME. IF THEY TAKE ON THE ALPS, THEY HAVE A TRAIN FULL OF DONKEYS BEHIND THEM TO GET THEM THERE. WE DON’T HAVE THAT LUXURY. SO, WE’RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE STUFF THAT DOESN’T BREAK. AND WE’RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE FOLKS THAT INSTEAD OF THE SUPER PILOT, HE’S THE REFRIGERATOR REPAIR GUY. HE CAN TEAR APART AND PUT IT BACK TOGETHER AND TRUST THAT IT WORKS BECAUSE HE’S LIVING OFF OF THAT MACHINE DOING ITS JOB. >> YEAH. >> SO, EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE IN THE GROCERY, YOU KNOW, OXYGEN, ET CETERA, YOU HAVE TO TAKE WITH YOU OR BUILD OR SUPPLY WHILE YOU’RE THERE. >> BUT IT TAKES GOOD PEOPLE TO DO THAT, RIGHT? YOU NEED FOLKS THAT HAVE KIND OF A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES THAT CAN ACTUALLY WORK ON THIS. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> SO, TELL ME, LAWRENCE, IN YOUR PERSPECTIVE KIND OF WHAT-- WHAT ARE SOME OF THE KEY FOLKS THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO BRING WITH YOU ON A MISSION OUT TO SPACE? >> WELL, YOU NEED SOMEONE WHO’S-- I WOULD THINK AN ENGINEER TYPE. >> DEFINITELY AN ENGINEER. >> WHO, YOU KNOW, WOULD BE SKEPTICAL AND THEN HAVE SOLUTIONS. AND I THINK YOU NEED SOMEBODY WHO’S GOT A GREAT IMAGINATION, WHO CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET TO THE NEXT-- WHAT THE THING IS THAT YOU’RE TRYING TO GET TO. >> A LEADER. YEAH. IN A WAY, I GUESS. >> AND YOU NEED-- YOU NEED HANDS. YOU NEED HELPERS. AND WHO ARE ALSO-- WHO HAVE SPECIALTIES-- SPECIAL TALENTS OF THEIR OWN BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU’RE JUST A LONELY, YOU KNOW, YOU’RE DOING IT ALL YOURSELF, YOU KNOW? IT’S KIND OF LIKE-- IT’S A LOT LIKE BEING IN A BAND. WE ALL SUPPORT EACH OTHER, OTHERWISE, OTHERWISE WE WOULD JUST BE ONE PERSON OUT THERE WITH A MICROPHONE. AND NO MATTER HOW GOOD YOU ARE, THERE’S LIMITS TO WHAT YOU CAN DO THERE. >> I THINK STYX WOULD SOUND A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WITH JUST ONE MEMBER. YEAH. >> YEAH, YEAH. I THINK THE, YOU KNOW, WE TALK ABOUT THE MACHINES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO DO ALL THIS, BUT, AGAIN, TALKING TO ASTRONAUT DAN. >> YEAH. >> I THINK MEDICAL IS A HUGE NECESSITY BECAUSE OUR BODIES MORPH AND HAVE TO ADAPT AND THEY DO ADAPT AND CHANGE IN THEIR-- SO THAT CHANGES THE WHOLE EQUATION OF WHAT MEDICALLY IS REQUIRED, YOU KNOW, AS THE THING CONTINUES ON. SO, I’D SAY-- I’D SAY AN ENGINEER, A REALLY GOOD DOCTOR, AND, YOU KNOW, PROBABLY A GOOD DRUMMER OR BASS PLAYER. >> I WOULD ADD A COMMUNICATOR.  >> OH, YEAH. >> SOMEONE WHO COULD TALK BACK TO THE FOLKS ON EARTH AND DESCRIBE, IN TERMS THEY UNDERSTAND, WHAT THEY ARE EXPERIENCING. >> HMM. >> AND THE OTHER THING IS YOU ALMOST HAVE TO HAVE TWO OF EVERYTHING, OR DOUBLE TRAINING. BECAUSE THAT DOCTOR, IF HE’S THE GUY THAT GETS THE PROBLEM-- >> YEAH. >> SOMEBODY ELSE NEEDS TO STEP IN. >> RIGHT. YOU WERE TELLING ME SOMETHING GREAT ABOUT THE-- OR, FRIGHTENING, ACTUALLY, ABOUT THE DUST ON MARS AFFECTING YOUR THYROID. THAT’S PART OF WHY MY BRAIN STARTED MOVING TOWARD THAT. >> YEAH. WE’VE GOT TO MAKE SURE WE SEPARATE THE BAD ACTORS FROM THE HUMAN ASPECT OF THAT. AND SO, ALL THE SYSTEMS WE’RE BUILDING, YOU SAW THE ROVER ITSELF. >> YEAH. >> THE SUIT’S PURPOSELY ON THE BACK SO THE DUST DOESN’T COME IN WITH YOU. IN APOLLO, WE DIDN’T HAVE THAT SEPARATION. >> RIGHT. >> IN THOSE DAYS, THEY USED ZIPPERS TO CLOSE UP THE SUIT AND DUST AND ZIPPERS DON’T LIKE EACH OTHER. >> RIGHT. >> THIS JUST IN. >> MM-HMM. >> AND SO, THE SUIT YOU SAW DIDN’T HAVE ANY ZIPPERS. WE’VE GONE AWAY FROM THAT NOW. >> RIGHT. >> SO, AND EVERYTHING’S ON THE BACK TO SEPARATE. SO, YEAH, THOSE ARE THE LITTLE DETAILS THAT GUYS THAT WORK WITH JOHN’S TEAMS ARE THINKING ABOUT EVERY SYSTEM. >> YEAH. AND IT KIND OF HELPS THAT WE’VE EXPLORED THE MOON, RIGHT? BECAUSE IF WE DIDN’T THINK ABOUT, “YEAH, YOU’RE GOING TO BE WALKING ON THE SURFACE, AND THEN, OH, YEAH, YOU’RE GOING TO TRACK ALL THAT DUST BACK INTO THE COCKPIT,” OR WHEREVER YOU’RE GOING TO BE FLYING FROM. NOW WE’RE DESIGNING, LIKE YOU SAID, YOU MENTIONED, IT’S CALL THE SEV, RIGHT? SPACE EXPLORATION VEHICLE? AND IT’S DESIGNED WHERE THE SUITS GO ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE SO YOU NEVER STEP INSIDE WITH THE SUIT, RIGHT? SO THAT’S THE GENERAL IDEA. AND THERE’S A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT EXAMPLES LIKE THAT, RIGHT? >> YEAH. >> WHERE YOU LEARN SOMETHING AND SOME KIND OF COOL NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT WE NEED TO EXPLORE A DIFFERENT PLANET OR SOMETHING COMES OUT OF IT. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT COMES-- THAT YOU CAN THINK OF BESIDES THE SUITS MAYBE? >> WELL, WE’LL HAVE ROBOTS TO ASSIST US THERE. ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT THE HUMAN ASPECT OF THIS FLIGHT IS ROBOTS CAN GO AND DISCOVER THINGS, AND WE’VE GOT ROBOTS ON MARS RIGHT NOW DISCOVERING STUFF. BUT THEY REALLY CAN’T EXPLORE. THEY CAN’T-- THE HUMAN BRAIN TO SEE THINGS AND COMMUNICATE BACK TO EARTH WHAT THEY’RE SEEING OR IF SOMETHING DOESN’T GO EXACTLY THE WAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO, TO REACT AND DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. SO, ROBOTS ARE GOING TO BE A BIG PART OF THE MISSION AND HAVE THEM INTERACT WITH THIS. AND YOU GUYS SAW SOME ROBOTS TODAY THAT WILL BE ALONG AS AN ASSIST. >> MM-HMM. >> SO, GOT TO MAKE SURE THEY DO THEIR JOB AS WELL. >> SO, THE ROBOTS WILL BE HELPING LIKE A HUMAN-- SO, FOR A MISSION-- OR, A MISSION TO MARS. RIGHT? HOW MANY CREW MEMBERS WOULD WE PROBABLY-- WOULD PROBABLY BE IDEAL TO TAKE ON A MISSION TO MARS? >> SO, MY NUMBER IS SIX. >> SIX, OKAY. >> OKAY? AND WE’VE DONE WHAT WE CALL CREW SKILL MIX STUDIES OVER THE YEARS. >> OKAY. >> AND IT’S LIKE GLENN SAID, YOU HAVE TO TAKE A DOCTOR BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER PERSON WHO’S MEDICALLY TRAINED IN CASE THE DOCTOR GETS SICK. YOU NEED ENGINEERS, YOU NEED GEOLOGISTS, YOU NEED ALL THE TECHNICAL-- IF YOU ADD UP ALL THE TECHNICAL SPECIALISTS, YOU PROBABLY NEED 25 PEOPLE. SO, THEN IT’S A MATTER OF HOW CAN YOU CROSS-TRAIN PEOPLE TO DO-- TO BE A DOCTOR/PILOT/GEOLOGIST. OKAY? >> WOW! >> AND THE BEST I’VE SEEN IS THAT YOU CAN PUT ALL THOSE SPECIALTIES INTO ABOUT SIX PEOPLE. >> WOW! THAT’S AMAZING. I MEAN, SOME OF THE FOLKS FROM THE NEW ASTRONAUT CLASS, RIGHT? I ACTUALLY HAD THE PLEASURE OF TALKING TO SOME OF THEM AND WE WENT THROUGH-- I TALKED WITH ANNE ROEMER ON ONE OF THE EARLIER PODCAST EPISODES AND WE JUST WENT THROUGH ALL OF THE DIFFERENT FOLKS THAT WE BROUGHT ON FOR THE CLASS OF 2017. WE HAVE 12 NEW ASTRONAUTS. EACH OF THEM DOES NOT JUST ONE THING. >> RIGHT. >> THEY DO A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS. >> YEAH. >> FOR EXAMPLE, WOODY HOBURG IS AN ENGINEER IN FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF-- HE’S LIKE COMPUTER SCIENCE, AND ELECTRICAL, AND AEROSPACE, AND MECHANICAL. LIKE HE’S ALL OF THEM. AND THEN WHEN YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT A DOCTOR PILOT, FRANK RUBIO IS A DOCTOR PILOT. HE FLEW HELICOPTERS, AND THEN HE DID SOME SKYDIVING, BUT THEN ALSO IS A MEDICAL DOCTOR BY TRAINING. IT’S INSANE. SO, THEY’RE FINDING THESE FOLKS THAT HAVE ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT SPECIALITIES, BUT WHEN YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT SCIENTIST/MEDICAL DOCTOR/PILOT AND THEN YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT FOLKS THAT ARE SLASH, SLASH, SLASH, IT’S AMAZING. I HAVE-- >> AND I WOULD RECOMMEND HAVING-- BEING ABLE TO PLAY AN INSTRUMENT. >> AND MANY ASTRONAUTS KNOW HOW TO. >> RIGHT. >> YEAH. >> WE HAVE GUITARS AND OTHER THINGS UP IN SPACE RIGHT NOW. >> YEAH. >> BECAUSE MUSIC IS REALLY A PART OF LIFE. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> AND IT’S ONE THING TO HAVE PRE-RECORDED MUSIC, BUT TO CREATE MUSIC AND MAKE YOUR OWN MUSIC WOULD BE PART OF IT. BECAUSE YOU NEED JOY. >> YEAH. ABSOLUTELY. >> YOU CAN’T DO-- NOT JUST WORKING ALL THE TIME. YOU NEED TO HAVE THE JOY OF LIFE. >> AND YOU’RE RIGHT, SOME OF THE-- SO, RIGHT, AS WE WERE SAYING, WE HAVE PROGRESSED FROM SHUTTLE FLIGHTS, WHICH WERE A COUPLE OF DAYS, ALL THE WAY UP TO NOW INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION FLIGHTS, WHICH ARE SEVERAL MONTHS. >> YEAH. >> SO, THEY’RE UP THERE FOR A LONG TIME AND A LOT OF THEM, LIKE YOU SAY, THEY DO BRING INSTRUMENTS. >> YEAH, CHRIS HADFIELD. >> WE HAVE-- CHRIS HADFIELD HAS HIS GUITAR, RIGHT? >> HE’S GREAT. >> HE’S JAMMIN’. WE’VE HAD FOLKS BRING FLUTES. >> CADY COLEMAN. >> CADY COLEMAN, RIGHT. AND THEN I THINK KJELL LINDGREN BROUGHT BAGPIPES, RIGHT? >> WOW! >> THEY MADE HIM PRACTICE WAY ON THE OTHER SIDE. >> YEAH! >> HE WASN’T INVITED BACK! >> YOU KNOW WHAT, IT’S FUNNY. YEAH, I THINK SIX IS A GOOD NUMBER. THERE’S SIX MEMBERS OF STYX AS WELL, AND WE ARE VERY GOOD AT THE MUSIC PART. >> WE DO HAVE A MECHANICAL ENGINEER. >> WELL, WE DO. WE HAVE ONE. THAT’S RIGHT. J.Y. HAS A DEGREE IN ROCKET SCIENCE. >> REALLY? >> HE DOES, ACTUALLY. >> THERE YOU GO! >> AND, YOU KNOW, JUST LIKE A BAND, A CREW HAS TO BE A VERY COHESIVE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO GET ALONG AND KNOW HOW TO SOLVE THEIR CONFLICTS WITHOUT LEAVING THE BAND. >> RIGHT. >> BECAUSE THERE’S NO PLACE TO GO UP THERE. >> YEAH. >> BECAUSE THEY ARE CONSTANTLY, THEY ARE ADJUSTING TO THINGS, YOU KNOW? AND YOU’RE-- A LOT OF TIMES YOU’RE WORKING ON NOT ENOUGH SLEEP, THE WEATHER DOESN’T COOPERATE WITH YOU, YOU’RE GOING INTO THESE HABITATS THAT ARE DIFFERENT EVERY DAY, AND DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS OF HOW OUR-- OUR DRESSING ROOM SOMETIMES WE’RE ALL IN ONE ROOM, SOMETIMES WE’RE IN-- WE HAVE INDIVIDUAL ROOMS. SO, YOU HAVE TO BE ADAPTABLE AND FLEXIBLE AND KNOW WHEN YOU ARE FATIGUED AND-- >> MM-HMM. >> YEP. >> AND KNOW YOURSELF. AND BEING IN A BAND IS-- WE’RE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE GROUP THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE SOMEHOW WE’VE-- WE JUST GET THROUGH IT ALL, DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO, ADAPT, AND THEN AT THE END OF THE NIGHT WE GET TO GO PLAY, AND THAT’S REALLY WHAT IT’S ALL ABOUT. YOU’RE WILLING TO GO THROUGH WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET THERE AND TO GET THAT 75 OR 90 OR 100 MINUTES. >> YEAH.  >> I THINK THAT’S-- THAT IS WHAT BEING A BAND IS SOMEWHAT AKIN TO WHAT YOU’RE SAYING. LIKE, YOU HAVE TO-- YOU HAVE TO KEEP-- THE FOCUS HAS TO REMAIN ON WHAT’S BIGGER THAN ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL. AND TO BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE YOUR WAY THROUGH THE-- HUMAN CONFLICT IS PART OF LIFE, AND IT’S PART OF DISCOVERY, AND IT’S PART OF THE FRICTION THAT BRINGS NEW THINGS ABOUT. BUT, TO DO THAT OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, AS THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE-- A CREW OF SIX WOULD BE FACED WITH,  THEY HAVE TO HAVE THOSE KINDS OF SKILLS IN ADDITION TO ALL THOSE OTHER TALENTS. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> SO, THAT’S HARD. HOW DO YOU? IT’S HARD TO PICK THOSE PEOPLE. >> IT’LL TAKE A WHILE TO GO THROUGH THAT EVALUATION. WE’LL HAVE LOTS OF CANDIDATES TO LINE UP FOR THOSE SIX SPOTS. >> YEAH. >> IT’S GOING TO FUNDAMENTALLY BE A DIFFERENT KIND OF ASTRONAUT THAN WE’VE HAD BEFORE, JUST BECAUSE OF THE LENGTH OF THE MISSION, AND THE SELF-RELIANCE, AND YOU DON’T HAVE-- EVEN COMMUNICATIONS. RIGHT NOW, IF WE WERE TO TALK TO SOMEONE ON MARS, YOU’RE 22 LIGHT MINUTES AWAY, ONE WAY. SO, IF YOU WERE TO ASK THEM, “HEY, CAN YOU GUYS HEAR ME?” YOU ALL CAN’T ANSWER BACK UNTIL 44 MINUTES LATER. AND SO, EVEN THE DYNAMICS OF HOW WE CONTROL A MISSION AND HOW WE CAN HELP THE PEOPLE UP THERE IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. SO, IT’S GOING TO BE A MUCH DIFFERENT MISSION THAN ANYTHING WE’VE EVER DONE, EVEN OUT TO THE MOON. >> AND I THINK WHAT’S EVEN-- YOU KNOW, ANOTHER IMPORTANT POINT IS THE FACT THAT THESE GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE NOT ONLY-- THEY’RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXPERTISE, BUT THEY’RE GOING TO BE TOGETHER FOR SUCH A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, SO THEY DEFINITELY HAVE TO GET ALONG PRETTY WELL. AND, YOU KNOW, IN MOMENTS OF CRISIS THEY HAVE TO KIND OF WORK THROUGH DIFFERENT SITUATIONS TOGETHER. AND AT THE DROP OF A HAT, ONE THING YOU’RE PLANNING ONE WAY, AND THEN IT’S GOING TO GO A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY. DO YOU GUYS HAVE ANY EXAMPLES ON STAGE WHERE SOMETHING JUST IS NOT GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN? >> EVERY NIGHT, YEAH. >> EVERY NIGHT! >> ABSOLUTELY. >> BUT I MEAN, YOU JUST HAVE TO PUSH THROUGH, RIGHT? >> YEAH, AS A BAND, YOU JUST-- YOU JUST PAY ATTENTION TO EACH OTHER, AND YOU GET-- IF IT GOES OFF THE RAILS, WHICH IT DOES SOMETIMES, BECAUSE YOU’RE ALL HUMAN-- >> YEAH. >> EVERYBODY JUST FOLLOWS YOU BACK-- OFF THE RAILS AND THEN BACK ON AGAIN. >> YEAH. >> AND YOU DON’T LET ON. >> YEAH, I HEAR YA! >> YEAH. IT’S A TWO-SIDED THING. ONE IS THAT THE MACHINERY HAS TO WORK IN ORDER FOR YOU TO PLAY IT PROPERLY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WE’RE ALL FOCUSED ON THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE AUDIENCE AS TO WHAT WE’RE DOING ON STAGE. SO, THAT’S MORE LIKE THE BIGGER PICTURE IS CONSTANTLY BEING READJUSTED TO. >> YEAH.  >> AND THAT HAS TO BE-- SOME OF THAT’S DONE ALMOST-- I MEAN, I WON’T SAY IT’S TELEPATHIC, BUT IT’S JUST A NATURAL REACTION THAT YOU HAVE TO EACH MEMBER OF THE GROUP, BECAUSE YOU REALLY ARE PLAYING TOGETHER. YOU’RE TRYING TO SPEAK AS ONE VOICE. >> YEAH.  >> THAT COHESIVENESS IS WHAT WE’VE GOT TO STRIVE FOR IN OUR CREWS. >> YEAH.  >> AND WE’LL HAVE INTERNATIONAL CREWS, SO WE’LL BE MIXING CULTURES, AS WELL, BUT THAT COHESIVENESS IS WHAT IS GOING TO MAKE US SUCCESSFUL OR UNSUCCESSFUL. >> WELL, THAT WOULD HINDER OUR FLIGHT. >> AND THAT WAS SO EVIDENT TODAY ABOUT HOW THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA HAVE COMBINED, AND WHEN THEY’RE SOMETIMES AT ODDS WITH EACH OTHER IS WHEN FINALLY A BETTER SOLUTION COMES OUT OF A SITUATION. >> AND WE’RE PRACTICING THAT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION RIGHT NOW. >> YEAH. >> TWELVE, THIRTEEN COUNTRIES ALL PARTICIPATING, MAKING THAT THING A SUCCESS. >> ABSOLUTELY! >> A CANADARM CAME, LIKE-- [ INDISTINCT ]  >> SO, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS IS WE TRAIN ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION ALL THE TIME. AND WE’RE TRAINING FOR MISSIONS BEYOND AND GETTING OURSELVES PREPARED. IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG, WE’LL BE PREPARED FOR IT BECAUSE WE’VE PRACTICED SO MANY TIMES. AND I’M GUESSING IT’S THE SAME FOR YOU GUYS, RIGHT? YOU’VE PRACTICED SO MANY TIMES THAT IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG, AT THE DROP OF A HAT, YOU CAN KIND OF-- YOU KNOW, THAT’S HOW YOU’RE ABLE TO PULL THROUGH ON ALL THESE NIGHTS. >> HOW ABOUT THE NIGHT IN CARMEL EARLIER THIS YEAR WHEN THE POWER COMPLETELY WENT OUT, 100%? YEAH. AND FORTUNATELY, WE WERE IN A THEATER THAT KIND OF HAD A-- IT HAD AN ALMOST STEEPLE-LIKE CHURCH TYPE THING. SO ALTHOUGH THERE WERE A COUPLE OF THOUSAND PEOPLE THERE, YOU COULD ACTUALLY HEAR FROM THE STAGE ACOUSTICALLY. SO, WE BASICALLY-- THIS WAS GREAT. >> WHILE WE WERE PLAYING A SONG! I HAD TO PLAY AN ACOUSTIC. >> OH, RIGHT! MAN IN THE WILDERNESS. >> EVERYTHING STOPPED. >> YEAH. >> BUT THE DRUMS WERE ACOUSTIC AND MY GUITAR WAS ACOUSTIC, SO WE JUST KEPT PLAYING. >> JUST IT TURNED INTO AN ACOUSTICS! OH, WOW! THAT’S AMAZING. >> YEAH. AN UNPLUGGED SET, RIGHT?  >> THE WEIRD THING IS THE AUDIENCE, LIKE, THEY GOT TOTALLY INTO IT. AND THEN EVENTUALLY WE FOUND A PIANO ABOUT FOUR FLOORS DOWN, SO PEOPLE ON HAND LOVED THE PIANO. IT WASN’T IN GREAT TUNE OR ANYTHING, BUT WE PLAYED FOR ABOUT ANOTHER HALF HOUR BEFORE THE-- WE WERE OUT OF HYPERGOLIC FUMES.  >> THAT’S FLEXIBILITY, ADAPTABILITY. THERE YOU GO! >> NO REFUNDS, WHICH WAS GREAT. >> THOSE ARE THE ONES YOU CAN REMEMBER, TOO, THOUGH. IT’S LIKE WHEN IT RAINS, OR YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF NATURAL THING THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF IT. THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT YOU REMEMBER BECAUSE YOU SEE-- YOU REALLY SEE WHAT THE BAND IS MADE OF, YOU KNOW, AND HOW YOU GET THROUGH THAT. AND YOUR AUDIENCE. THEY’RE WILLING TO-- IF THEY’RE WILLING TO WAIT AND STAY THROUGH THE WEATHER, THEN WE’RE CERTAINLY GOING TO DO IT. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> AND YOU MENTIONED EARLIER KIND OF THE BIG PICTURE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE AUDIENCE. MARS IS REALLY A DESTINATION, BUT GETTING THERE, WE HAVE TO SOLVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROBLEMS THAT WE HOPE TO DRIVE RIGHT BACK INTO LIFE HERE ON EARTH, TO MAKE LIFE ON EARTH EVEN BETTER FOR US AS MANKIND. >> RIGHT. >> BY SOLVING THE PROBLEMS THAT WOULD GO INTO THIS PLACE. SO, MARS IS A GREAT DRAW BECAUSE IT REALLY PUSHES US TO SOLVE SOME PRETTY TOUGH PROBLEMS. WATER RECLAMATION FOR THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES. >> RIGHT. >> WE HAVE TO HAVE PURE WATER FOR THIS TRIP. SO, THOSE KIND OF SPIN-OFFS ARE PART OF WHAT WE DO, AS WELL, IN THE BIG PICTURE. >> YEAH, FOR SURE. >> THOSE ARE KIND OF-- TO YOUR POINT, LAWRENCE, WHERE YOU HAVE ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY AND YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT, BUT THEN ULTIMATELY THE GOAL. THE GOAL FOR US IS MARS. THE GOAL FOR YOU GUYS IS THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE AUDIENCE. SO, EVERYTHING HAS TO WORK, BUT IF IT DOESN’T, YOU STILL HAVE TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. >> YEAH. >> AND THAT’S WHERE YOU-- YOU’RE BRINGING A PIANO FROM FOUR FLOORS UNDER TO STILL ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. AND IT’S WORKING.  >> YEAH. >> BUT I GUESS FOR SPACE IT’S JUST A TEENY BIT HARDER. >> I THINK SO. >> YEAH, NO EXTRA PIANO. >> NO, EXACTLY. >> THAT’S ONE OF THE HARDEST PARTS FOR US, IS LIKE WHEN YOU-- TO YOUR POINT, JOHN, WHEN YOU WERE SAYING FOR APOLLO MISSIONS, WE BROUGHT EVERYTHING WITH US, RIGHT? NO SPARE PARTS. I THINK A PERFECT EXAMPLE IS APOLLO 13, WHERE THINGS WERE GOING WRONG. WE DIDN’T HAVE SPARE PARTS TO FIX THINGS, BUT WE STILL FIXED THEM WITH THE STUFF WE HAD ON BOARD, RIGHT? YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT ENGINEERS GETTING TOGETHER IN MISSION CONTROL AND JUST LAYING OUT ALL THE STUFF THAT THEY KNEW WAS IN THE CAPSULE AND SAYING, “ALL RIGHT, HOW CAN WE FIX THIS ISSUE?” WE ACTUALLY HAD SOMETHING VERY RECENTLY, TOO, WHERE WE HAD-- WE WERE DOING A SPACE WALK A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, RIGHT, AND WE WERE SUPPOSED TO PUT A SHIELD ON THE OUTSIDE OF ONE OF THE MODULES. WELL, THE SHIELD GOT INADVERTENTLY LOST. SO, THERE WERE FOUR SHIELDS, AND  WE WERE SUPPOSED TO PUT UP ONE, TWO, THREE, AND THEN THERE’S THIS EXPOSED PART ON ONE SIDE, AND WE NEEDED TO COVER IT UP. WELL, IT JUST SO HAPPENED THAT DURING THE SAME SPACE WALK WE TOOK ANOTHER COVER OFF OF ANOTHER PART OF THE SPACECRAFT. SO, ENGINEERS TOOK THAT COVER AND SAID, “OKAY, HOW CAN WE FIT THIS COVER ONTO THIS PART?” IT WAS LIKE-- IT WAS KIND OF REMINISCENT OF THAT TIME WHERE YOU HAD TO THROW EVERYTHING-- ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO WE HAVE AND WHAT CAN WE DO? AND THEY FIGURED IT OUT. THEY ACTUALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO LAY THIS COVER OVER THAT EXPOSED PART. INSANE. THAT’S, I GUESS, OUR GRAND PIANO MOMENT, RIGHT? >> THAT’S GOT TO BE A GREAT DAY FOR THE CREW, THOUGH, TO-- >> OH, IT REALLY WAS. >> FOR EVERYBODY. TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. >> I THINK WHAT’S EVEN BETTER IS DURING THAT SPACE WALK, I THINK WE GOT EVERYTHING DONE, RIGHT? >> OH, YEAH. >> I THINK ALL THE MISSIONS WERE-- EVEN WITH THAT SETBACK, WE STILL ACCOMPLISHED THE MISSION AND GOT EVERYTHING DONE WE NEEDED TO. IT’S REALLY CRAZY. AND THAT’S THE STUFF WE’VE GOT TO PREPARE FOR. AND THAT’S THE STUFF YOU’RE THINKING ABOUT, RIGHT? AND WHAT HAPPENS-- HOW MANY SITUATIONS, JOHN, ARE YOU THINKING, “OKAY, IF THIS GOES WRONG, THIS IS WHAT WE’RE GOING TO DO”? HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU THINK THAT IN A DAY? >> HOW LONG DO YOU GOT? >> SO, WE WILL TAKE SOME SPARES WITH US, OKAY? >> YEAH! >> WE’RE NOT JUST GOING TO HAVE THE BOX OF STUFF WE HAVE. >> YEAH, YEAH. >> BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT OVER TIME SOME THINGS BREAK. AND SO, WHAT WE’RE LOOKING AT IS WHAT THINGS ARE MOST LIKELY TO BREAK, AND WE’LL TAKE SPARES FOR THOSE AND FIGURE OUT WAYS TO FIX THE STUFF THAT GOES WRONG. SO, YEAH, YOU CAN’T ASSUME EVERYTHING IS GOING TO WORK JUST RIGHT. >> MM-HMM. >> SO, A LOT OF THE PLANNING WE DO IS FIGURING OUT WHAT TOOLS, WHAT SPARES, WHAT MAINTENANCE EQUIPMENT TO TAKE WITH US TO FIX STUFF THAT’S GOING TO GO WRONG, BECAUSE THAT’S ALL WE GOT, YOU KNOW? NO PIANO IN THE BASEMENT. >> YEAH, HE HAS A TERM CALLED DISSIMILAR REDUNDANCY. SO, ELECTRIC GUITAR AND AN ACOUSTIC GUITAR. >> YEAH. >> THAT’S ON STAGE WITH YOU. AND SO WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT BUILDS OXYGEN AND SOMETHING ELSE THAT BUILDS OXYGEN OVER HERE, IN CASE THIS ONE FAILS. >> AND, YOU KNOW, AT A CERTAIN YOU’RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF HARDWARE ON MARS. SO, IT STANDS TO REASON THAT YOU COULD DO-- YOU COULD SALVAGE PARTS, AND-- >> OH, SURE, YEAH.  >> AND THAT’S WHY IT’S VERY IMPORTANT TO USE THE SAME SIZE SCREWS FOR EVERYTHING AND THINGS LIKE THAT. >> YEAH. >> WOW, AMAZING. SO, BEFORE WE WRAP UP, LAWRENCE, TOMMY, DO YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF-- JUST TALKING ABOUT EXPLORING THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS, DO YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF FLOATING QUESTIONS THAT, YOU KNOW, JUST SORT OF POPPED UP, JUST BASED ON THE TOUR AND THIS KIND OF  CONVERSATION? ANYTHING THAT YOU WERE WONDERING? OR MAYBE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT STUFF THAT YOU WEREN’T WONDERING BUT HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF NOW? >> WELL, WHAT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS SEE SUSPENDED ANIMATION, OR LIKE-- IS THERE ANY REALITY TO THAT CONCEPT? >> IT MAKES FOR GOOD ENTERTAINING. >> YEAH, THAT’S-- I’M AN ENGINEER. THAT’S WAY OUT OF MY EXPERTISE. >> YEAH, THAT-- WE’LL HAVE TO BRING A DOCTOR IN FOR THAT. NO, I DON’T THINK WE’RE DOING MUCH IN THOSE FIELDS, THAT I KNOW OF, ANYWAY. >> THAT IS-- IT’S A GOOD TOOL TO GET YOU PLACES WHEN YOU’RE TELLING A STORY. >> YEP. >> ABSOLUTELY. BUT YOU KNOW, FOR THE MISSIONS THAT YOU GUYS ARE PLANNING FOR, YOU’RE TALKING-- YOU KNOW, HOW WILL THEY GET THROUGH THOSE COUPLE OF MONTHS? BECAUSE WHAT YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT, I THINK THE SHORTEST TIME TO GET TO MARS WILL BE SEVEN MONTHS, RIGHT? MAYBE CLOSER TO NINE. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO BE DOING IN THAT TIME TO SORT OF FILL IT? >> SO, THAT’S A GREAT QUESTION. SO, THEY’RE GOING TO BE EXERCISING LIKE CRAZY, BECAUSE YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT MARS AS HEALTHY AS YOU COULD POSSIBLY BE. >> YEAH. >> THEY’RE GOING TO BE KEEPING THE SYSTEMS RUNNING. BUT THEY’RE GOING TO BE DOING AS MUCH SCIENCE AS THEY CAN ON THE WAY, TOO. NOW, MOST OF THE SCIENCE WILL PROBABLY BE SCIENCE ON THEMSELVES, SCIENCE ON THE HUMANS. BECAUSE WE’VE NEVER BEEN IN THAT DEEP SPACE CONDITION FOR THAT LONG BEFORE. THERE’S ALSO-- YOU KNOW, WE’VE ACTUALLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT THEM DOING ASTRONOMY ALONG THE WAY. SO, THERE WILL BE REAL SCIENCE THAT THEY ACCOMPLISH, NOT JUST TRYING TO STAY HEALTHY. >> DO WE HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF HOW, YOU KNOW, THE SKY, I GUESS, WILL LOOK ON THAT TRANSIT TO MARS? WILL YOU BE ABLE TO SEE A LOT OF DIFFERENT STARS? >> YEAH. IN FACT, THAT’S ALL YOU’LL BE ABLE TO SEE. >> ALL RIGHT, COOL! BECAUSE I GUESS THE VIEWS-- >> BECAUSE THE EARTH IS GOING TO BECOME A LITTLE BLUE DOT VERY QUICKLY. >> YEAH. >> AND MARS WILL STILL BE OUR LITTLE RED DOT OUT THE OTHER WINDOW. >> SUN’S GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER. >> YEAH, THE SUN IS JUST A KIND OF A BIGGER STAR IN THE SKY, AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS JUST STARS. >> AMAZING. BUT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WEIGHT, RIGHT? THAT’S ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. HOW MUCH STUFF CAN WE BRING WITH US ON THAT JOURNEY TO MARS? >> JUST ENOUGH. THAT’S HOW MUCH WE CAN BRING. >> SO NOW I’M GUESSING TELESCOPES IS PART OF THAT JUST ENOUGH. >> RIGHT. >> OH, YEAH. >> YEAH. IN SPACE, IN THE HUMAN SPACE TRAVEL, MASS IS ALMOST EQUAL TO COST, RIGHT? >> YEAH. >> SO, YOU KNOW, FOR EVERY BIT OF MASS YOU ADD, YOU’RE ADDING COST, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BOOST IT INTO SPACE AND GET IT TO WHERE YOU NEED TO GET IT. SO, EVERYTHING WE DO IS ALL ABOUT SAVING MASS. IN THE APOLLO MISSIONS, THEY ACTUALLY SAWED THE HANDLE OFF OF TOOTHBRUSHES TO SAVE MASS. >> WOW. >> HUH! >> JUST BECAUSE MASS WAS SO PRECIOUS BACK THEN. >> UNBELIEVABLE. >> THEY FIGURE YOU COULD USE A TOOTHBRUSH THAT HAS A LITTLE ONE INCH HANDLE ON IT AS GOOD AS YOU CAN USE A TOOTHBRUSH THAT HAS A SIX INCH HANDLE ON IT. >> WOW. >> WOW, THAT’S AMAZING. THAT’S CHECK-IN LUGGAGE, RIGHT THERE. >> YEAH. A LITTLE BIT STRICTER RESTRICTIONS THAN THE TSA, I THINK, FOR SPACE FLIGHT. >> YEAH, YEAH. >> ANY MORE DYING QUESTIONS BEFORE WE WRAP UP? >> I DON’T HAVE ANYTHING-- I DON’T KNOW IF I HAVE ANYTHING PERTINENT TO EITHER OF YOU GUYS, BECAUSE I THINK THE THING THAT IMPRESSED ME TODAY, AGAIN, WAS WHEN DAN WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH EXERCISE. LIKE YOU WERE SAYING, YOU HAVE TO ARRIVE THERE HEALTHY. IT JUST GOT ME THINKING A LOT ABOUT HOW MUCH WE-- OUR BODIES CHANGE WHEN WE’RE AWAY FROM THIS PLANET, AND OVER SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. AND THAT GETS ME THINKING ABOUT, WELL, WHAT WILL HUMANITY LOOK LIKE? HOW WOULD-- WHAT WILL WE BE LIKE ONCE WE’VE SPENT A FEW YEARS SOMEWHERE ELSE? LIKE, IT COULD ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY CHANGE US INCREDIBLY. ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS I HEARD IS APPARENTLY YOUR WRINKLES GO AWAY. >> THAT’S GOOD. >> BUT I MEAN, AS A SPECIES, IT ACTUALLY WILL CHANGE US. >> YEAH, I THINK IF WE-- IF THERE’S PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY ARE BORN AND LIVE ON MARS, WITHIN A FEW GENERATIONS, YEAH, YOU WILL BE CHANGED BECAUSE YOU’RE LIVING IN A LOWER GRAVITY ENVIRONMENT YOUR ENTIRE LIFE AND-- SURE. >> MIGHT EVEN DEVELOP IMMUNITIES TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER, GLENN, BUT, YOU KNOW, CERTAIN THINGS-- I DON’T KNOW. I’M JUST SPITBALLING HERE. >> YEAH! >> IF I HAD A CHANCE, I’LL TALK TO MY GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GRANDSON ONE DAY, AND I’LL ASK HIM THE QUESTION. >> YEAH, GOOD! >> YEAH, AWESOME. WELL, GUYS, IT’S BEEN AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE TO BOTH TALK TO YOU AS A PART OF THIS PODCAST, BUT ALSO HAVE YOU HERE TODAY AND KIND OF SHOW YOU EVERYTHING THAT WE’RE DOING. AND IT’S JUST SO EXCITING TO SEE HOW ENGAGED YOU WERE AND TO-- YOU KNOW, IT’S BEEN A REAL ABSOLUTE PLEASURE. AND, OF COURSE, JOHN AND GLENN, THANKS FOR TALKING ABOUT THE REAL SCIENCE THAT WE’RE DOING HERE AT THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER. >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING US. >> THANKS FOR ASKING US. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> IT WAS UNFORGETTABLE. [ MUSIC ] [ INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ] >> NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY, BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD. >> HOUSTON, WELCOME TO SPACE. >> HEY, THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND. SO TODAY WE TALKED WITH GLENN LUTZ, JOHN CONNOLLY, AND SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF STYX, JUST ABOUT EXPLORING THE COSMOS AND HUMAN EXPLORATION. IT WAS A FANTASTIC CONVERSATION, AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW, BECAUSE YOU’VE LISTENED TO THE WHOLE THING AT THIS POINT. BUT IF YOU GO TO NASA.GOV ON THE FRONT PAGE YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE’RE EXPLORING, ALL THE PLACES WE ARE IN THE UNIVERSE, BOTH ROBOTIC MISSIONS AND HUMAN MISSIONS.

        description: "If you’re fascinated by the idea of humans traveling through space and curious about how that all works, you’ve come to the right place.  “Houston We Have a Podcast” is the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center from Houston, Texas, home for NASA’s astronauts and Mission Control Center. Listen to the brightest minds of America’s space agency – astronauts, engineers, scientists and program leaders – discuss exciting topics in engineering, science and technology, sharing their personal stories and expertise on every aspect of human spaceflight. Learn more about how the work being done will help send humans forward to the Moon and on to Mars in the Artemis program.  For Episode 120, Chris Hansen, manager of the Extravehicular Activity Office, talks about the next generation of spacesuits that will be used during the Artemis Program. Hansen discusses the features, development, and testing of the two suits, and he previews upcoming milestones before these new suits are worn by the next astronauts on the Moon. This episode was recorded on October 30th, 2019.  Gary Jordan (Host):  Houston, We Have a Podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center Episode 120, “Artemis Spacesuits.” I'm Gary Jordan. I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. So on October 15th, 2019 NASA unveiled the next generation of spacesuits that will take humans to the Moon with NASA's Artemis Program. I say spacesuits plural because there are two. One for getting to the Moon and back, and one for exploring the surface of the Moon. The Orion Crew Survival suit does exactly what it sounds like: helps the crew survive in Orion, the deep-space capsule that will transport the crew to and from the Moon. But there are many layers to that and a lot of interesting technologies added to the spacesuit that you might not have thought about. Then there's the xEMU, [Exploration extravehicular mobility unit] that will be used on the Moon's surface. For those familiar with human spaceflight or those who have listened to our “Spacesuits” episode, Episode 16, hint, hint, you might recognize the extravehicular mobility unit in there, the EMU. This is the suit used for spacewalks on the space station today. The X in front is for Exploration. Sure, the name looks a little bit the same, but there are a lot of differences that makes this suit the right one for the Moon. So here to go into great detail about each of these suits and what we have to look forward to is Chris Hansen. Chris is the manager of the Extravehicular Activity Office here at the Johnson Space Center. And he's here with us to go over the intricate details of the Orion Crew Survival Suit, the OCSS, and the xEMU, some of the development and testing and some of the milestones to look forward to until we actually see these suits in action both for testing and for when they're donned to take the first steps on the Moon since 1972. So here we go. Artemis Generation Spacesuits with Chris Hansen. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Chris Hansen, thanks so much for coming on the podcast today.  Chris Hansen: Sure. Thanks for having me.  Host: Big event we had recently at headquarters. The administrator brought out -- it was Kris Davis and Dustin Gohmert. Am I saying that right?  Chris Hansen: Yeah, Dustin.  Host: Awesome event. They were right in the suits, they were moving around. It looked really cool. Then you had a Q and A with the administrator. Kate Rubins was there and everything. How was that? How was the whole event?  Chris Hansen: Yeah, so it was really exciting. For me it's the first time I've really spent any kind of close time with the administrator. So that was really exciting. He's a very interesting guy. He's like a storm rolling into the room and he's very excited about what we do. He's very supportive of what we do. For those of you that ever have been lucky enough to meet Kate Rubins, she's also really, really cool. She's one of the nicest and smartest people I've ever met. And so it was really fun to be able to do that event with those two particularly.  Host: Yeah.  Chris Hansen: Talking about spacesuits.  Host: And it was great because we're talking about the next generation of suits. I know a lot of us, you know, the EMU we've had a podcast about it before. This is the spacesuit that's on the International Space Station right now. But thinking about that next generation, you know, you're looking at it and it feels real.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: It's like, \"Wow, that's going to be the suit we're going to be seeing on the surface of the Moon.\" It's pretty cool.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: So I wanted to go into all the details with you today.  Chris Hansen: Yeah, let's do it.  Host: This'll be great. You are the manager of the Extravehicular Activity Office, mostly over the xEMU, right, one of the ones we're going to be talking about today.  Chris Hansen: Well, so not mostly. So actually my responsibility is for EVA activities across the entire agency.  Host: I see.  Chris Hansen: So everything EVA, and that includes the current EVA work we do on space station with the EMU. So my office is responsible for all of that, including the exploration work that we do with the xEMU and the XEVA systems that we'll be talking about today.  Host: OK. Well let's start with the EVA part of things.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: I think that's where your expertise is.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: We're talking about the xEMU. This is the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit.  Chris Hansen: Yeah, we love acronyms.  Host: Acronyms, man. Yeah.  Chris Hansen: We really love it.  Host: So xEMU, what are the main differences? If you had to compare the EMU that we know today on the space station to this xEMU, what are the main differences that you would highlight?  Chris Hansen: Yeah, so let me start with a little bit of -- we've been doing EVAs for 50 years.  Host: OK.  Chris Hansen: All the way back from Gemini through the Apollo program. You saw us hopping around on the Moon. We learned so much from that and then we graduated into the Space Shuttle program. So the EMU that we use today was actually developed in the late '70's, early '80's and hasn't been modified significantly for use on the International Space Station. So the suit you see today is fundamentally the same suite we used back in the late '70's, early '80's. So we've learned a lot using that suit and so today we've tried to take everything we've learned about the old suit and upgraded it, improved it, tried to make it better for the xEMU. So in the xEMU a lot of those lessons learned have been rolled and incorporated. If we start with the part that you can see, so Kris was out walking around and you got to see one of the main features of what we call the pressure garment system. So the pressure garment system for a suit is the part that you can see. On the EMU it's the white part, it's the arms, the legs, the body, the helmet, all of that is what we call the pressure garment. The other part of that system is the portable life support system which is in the backpack. There's a lot of things in the backpack. It's a backpack, it's a very high-tech system. There's a lot of differences between that and the current EMU and I'll talk about it. Let me start with the part you can see.  Host: Yeah.  Chris Hansen: So Kris was walking around on the stage and that's one of the important differences. What we want when we go back to the Moon this time and on to Mars is to actually do exploration. And to do that we have to allow our astronauts to work like geologists. Fundamentally a lot of the science we'll be doing early on the Moon is geology. And if you've ever hung around with a geologist, they don't like taking paths. They like getting off paths. They like climbing over rocks, they like interacting with the environment around them to learn. And so we've got to have a suit that allows them to do that. The original Apollo suits, it was very difficult for the crew to bend their knees, to bend down, to lunge, to grab things. They practically had to fall over to pick up a rock and kind of do a pushup to get back up. And so we want a suit that enables them to move. And so what you saw in the xEMU was a suit that's got lower torso mobility. You can actually bend your knees and bend your legs and bend down. You saw even in 1-G which is, you know, six times more gravity than we'll have on the surface of the Moon, Kris was able to bend down, pick up a rock on the stage, hand it to the administrator. In addition to that, so that's lower body mobility, we've learned with the current suit that upper body mobility is almost just as important. The crew needs to be able to move their arms, particularly our smaller crew members in this suit. It's got to be fitted to them in such a way that it allows them to move so that the joints line up with the joints of your body so that it acts really much more like your body. So the xEMU has some very important features in the shoulders that allow you to move. The bearings of the shoulders, we call them the scye bearings, s-[c]-y-e, the scye bearings, are much closer into the body so it aligns much better with our smaller crew members and allows them to move much more naturally. Kris did some demonstrations where she could actually reach all the way across her body to grab something. In the current EMU, our smaller crew members have a lot of difficulty doing that. It's a very difficult reach that controls up around their head where the lights are, where the cameras are. It's much more difficult. So this suit is changing a lot of that in the pressure garment system.  Host: Yeah.  Chris Hansen: In addition, what you didn't see -- some problems we'll have to tackle is the environment's very different on the surface of the Moon than it is in the space station. One of those is microgravity on the space station and one-sixth gravity on the surface of the Moon. So we have to deal with that. In addition, there's a lot of dust. We learned in Apollo, we brought a lot of that dust back with us. That dust is very sharp. It's very corrosive. It gets into our equipment and gets into the materials and the bearings, and so this suit has to protect itself from all of those environments. So that's from the pressure garment. The helmet was different. The helmet is hemispherical and it allows the crew members inside that suit the ability to look down and see their feet, to look up and see the sky, look right and left and have a much wider range of vision in this suit from the pressure garment side. Now in the --  Host: Go ahead. Well, what I'm hearing now is thinking about the spacesuit we have on the space station, if you look at them actually doing spacewalks, they're not really using their feet too much. They're using mostly arms. They need that mobility. But what I'm hearing now is the xEMU is all about mobility. It's about mobility. It's about the flexibility of the legs. It's about the mobility of your arms. It's about that reach. You're getting all of those little extra things that are going to help you in exploring the surface of the Moon.  Chris Hansen: Exactly right. That's one of the major differences in terms of the pressure garment system. Now the life support system is also very different. Now the EMU is a beautiful machine. It has worked really well for us. But there are some features in that suit that we definitely want to change. One of those is we want to make it safer. We want it to have fewer failure modes. A lot of you are familiar with the EVA 23 incident where we had water in the helmet. Some of that is because of the complexities of that design, the water and air loops are in kind of close contact. So we wanted to separate those loops so the loops are completely separate. In addition, if you ever watch EVAs, one of the main limitations for how long we can go is how much CO2 absorption capability -- the suit has to absorb CO2 as the crew members work and build up that CO2 in the system. Every system we have today, lithium hydroxide, the metox cans that we use today all have a limited capacity. Once that system is full of carbon dioxide, you're finished. You have to come back inside. So it's a limit for how long you can stay outside. The new system we've built is called a swing bed. That system has been tested out on the space station. Orion uses the system and it continuously scrubs CO2. So it has two absorption beds. One of those beds is active. It's actively absorbing CO2. When it gets full, we switch the system over to the other bed and we let it absorb CO2. And while it's absorbing CO2, that first bed is exposed to vacuum. And so all that CO2 is burned off into the environment and it empties the case as you were. And then when it's full, then we just switch back and forth. So we have a continuous ability to get rid of CO2 out of the system. So it will no longer be a consumable or limitation for us. We can go for as long as we have battery power. It will continue to desorb CO2. So that's a big difference from the system we use today.  Host: That's huge. These are -- I can't wait to go into the details.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: I do want to switch over to the other suit.  Chris Hansen: Sure.  Host: Because I really wanted to do like a high level of what is this suit?  Chris Hansen: Yeah, absolutely.  Host: And it sounds like it's this -- if you want it to go outside of a habitat or your lander, whatever and explore the Moon, this thing is great because of these reasons.  Chris Hansen: Yep.  Host: And that was perfectly it. Now this Orion Crew Survival Suit, this was the other one that they rolled out.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: It looks a little bit different.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: Now what purpose does this one serve?  Chris Hansen: So there's something similar between both of them. Fundamentally they have the same job. They have to keep a human alive in a very extreme environment. But the environments they're designed to work in are significantly different. The Orion Crew Survival System, we call it OCSS, that's the acronym, OCSS, is designed to keep the astronauts safe inside the Orion vehicle. They wear it during launch and entry and reentry. And it's designed to protect them from potential failures of that system. If they have a depressurization event, the suit can actually hold pressure and will keep them alive. That suit is generally hooked with an umbilical to the Orion's life support system. So it will feed them, it will give them oxygen. They have portable oxygen tanks on them. If the crew members need to leave the vehicle, say for instance after they've landed in the water and they need to get out -- if there's smoke in the air, if there's a contamination that will allow them time to get out of the vehicle. The suit will protect them from fire. The suit is also there -- it's integrated very carefully with the seat to protect the crew members during landing. If there's a crash, there's a high load event, the suit and the seat actually protect the astronauts physically. Kind of like being in a race car where the seatbelt holds them in, it keeps them safe, allows them to survive that and then to get out of the vehicle if they need to. Again, it's also got a lot of requirements -- the Orion's designed to leave low Earth orbit. It's designed to go to the Moon. So if you're a long ways away from home and you have a vehicle that's now depressurized, this suit will keep them alive. So it's designed to keep them alive for days inside this suit. Enough for them to get back home and get back on the ground. So the suit does a lot of very complicated requirements. One of the big differences is it doesn't have its own portable life support system. It uses the Orion's life support systems to keep those crew members alive. So that's one of the things that differentiates it between the xEMU that we were just talking about. In addition, it lives in a less extreme thermal environment. When we go to the surface of the Moon it can be as hot as 250 degrees, as cold as negative 250 degrees depending on where we're at. And the South Pole’s got a wide range of thermal environments that it has to deal with. The Orion suit doesn't have to deal with those extremes in thermal, so it's less complicated in that sense. The color -- you notice the colors very different. The color is bright orange.  Host: Yeah.  Chris Hansen: And the reason it's bright orange is because the Orion is a water landing vehicle. So there's a possibility the crew may need to get out of that vehicle and be in the water. It's got a life preserver. But we also want to make it easier for search and rescue crews to find the astronauts. So the bright orange color makes that easier. So it's all really about crew safety and protecting the crew in all of these contingency events they might see in the spacecraft.  Host: There you go. So those are the primary uses and they were both rolled out. They're awesome looking suits too.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: One of them is to be used on the Moon, that xEMU, and the other one is to be used in transit to and from.  Chris Hansen: To and from.  Host: To and from the Moon. Keep the guys and girls -- we're talking about the first woman and the next man on the surface of the Moon.  Chris Hansen: Absolutely.  Host: We've got to make sure you say that.  Chris Hansen: Absolutely.  Host: But we're talking about these critical components of the entire mission. Let's go into the weeds.  Chris Hansen: Yeah, let's do it.  Host: This is one of my favorite things to do. So the xEMU, the one that's going to be on the surface of the Moon, let's start head-to-toe. If you're looking at the different features of this, you're looking at the logic of the design, starting with the helmet -- you know, I know if you're looking at Apollo 17, that famous shot of Dr. Schmidt on the surface of the Moon with the visors on the side. You know what I'm talking about?  Chris Hansen: Yeah, yeah.  Host: And the Moon in the background. Now this one looks a little bit different. What's the logic of the design of the helmet?  Chris Hansen: Yeah. So let me start with the helmet. Again, we talked about the shape of the helmet gives them a much wider range of vision.  Host: Right.  Chris Hansen: We also have those same sun shades.  Host: Great.  Chris Hansen: The sun is very, very bright. Now the plan is to go to the South Pole and a crater, so we're going to have to deal also with being in a very dark location which we didn't have to deal with generally during the Apollo program. We're going to be down potentially in a crater, so we have -- we'll have lights onboard. We will this time -- one of my goals is when we go back to the Moon this time I want the whole world to go with us. I want high-definition cameras. I want virtual reality systems. I want everybody on the planet to be able to be on the shoulder of that astronaut when we walk on the Moon next time so that we take the whole world with us. So we will have much higher definition cameras with us. We'll have high-speed communication systems so that is something that will be very different. The thermal protection garment, we talked about it. There was a question -- I know the suit that we brought out for the D.C. event had kind of a cool red, white and blue pattern.  Host: Yeah.  Chris Hansen: That's mostly to help -- it mostly gives the engineers -- they can kind of have some fun with what it looks like from a design standpoint. We haven't designed the thermal protection garment. Because of the thermal environment it's very likely going to be white.  Host: Oh, OK.  Chris Hansen: Which is a little less interesting. So it gives our engineers a little bit of kind of fun to play with.  Host: Sure.  Chris Hansen: Kind of a nice design. But ultimately the thermal protection garment will have to protect us from the thermal extremes. There are potential micrometeoroid impacts on the surface from asteroids hitting the Moon that we have to protect the crew members from. The radiation environment is different so we have to do a little bit of protection from the radiation. We talked about the life support system. The other thing that we want is we want to make sure we have as much time to do EVAs as we can. So we actually have much higher-pressure oxygen tanks inside the system which allows us to squeeze more oxygen into that life support system so we can do longer EVAs. Ultimately what would be nice is that the limitation in the system is the person in the suit and not the suit themselves. So I want a suit that will do whatever a human being can possibly do on the surface of the Moon and let them go be scientists and not have to worry so much about the equipment. It will do whatever they need it to do.  Host: Yeah. So as long as they want to be out, the suit will carry them for as long as they need.  Chris Hansen: Yeah, that's the goal for sure.  Host: Yeah. I saw something about -- you're talking about the oxygen tanks.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: I saw something about rechargeable technologies where you're talking about being out there for longer lengths of time. We already talked a little bit about the carbon dioxide scrubbing which is huge. And that is -- you're right -- a limitation of how long you can be out there. Now what about this charging technology?  Chris Hansen: So that's actually not new in the sense that even the current EMU, we do multiple -- you've seen lately we've been doing EVAs on the space station. So we recharge those oxygen tanks on the current EMU. The advantage of this one is that the pressure tanks are much higher.  Host: I see.  Chris Hansen: So they charge up to 3,000 pounds per square inch which gives us a lot more capability. So we'll be able to recharge the oxygen tanks between EVAs. We do that today on the current EMU just at lower pressures. So we don't get -- we can't squeeze as much oxygen into the system. But we'll have to put more oxygen into the system. We'll have to recharge the batteries. Everybody's used to recharging the batteries in their toys when they play with them. You've got to do the same thing on the suits. We have lithium ion batteries in the system so we'll have to recharge those when we get back in. And the system uses water for cooling. So the cooling system -- so we'll have to recharge water when we bring those suits back inside in the lander when we're doing exploration on the Moon. That's very similar to what we do on the space station today. We recharge the suits with water. It uses a different cooling technology, the EMU versus the xEMU. The EMU uses a technology called sublimation. We actually create ice out of that water. As that ice hits vacuum, it sublimates off, gets very cold. It cools the water that we run behind it and that water then cools the astronauts inside the suits. The new suit uses a different technology called the suit water membrane evaporator. So rather than freezing water, we're actually evaporating water in a much more controlled way. The advantage of that system is it's much less sensitive to contamination in the water. We tested that. That's actually a system that NASA designed. We developed that here at NASA Johnson Space Center. We built it, we've been testing it. The sublimation system is very sensitive to water quality. We've had some issues with contaminating onboard the space station. This system is much less sensitive to contamination.  Host: I see. So this goes back to a lot of those themes about -- and this was even true when you were talking about some of the life support systems. You have that redundancies, those redundancies, right? You're talking about the safety of the crew at this point, right?  Chris Hansen: Yes.  Host: The safety of the system, but ultimately the safety of the crew.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: You know, a lot of technology, a lot of the improvements you're talking about go into making sure this thing is going to be reliable when we pull it out.  Chris Hansen: Yeah. The other thing that we've done -- there's a couple other things we've done with this system. We've put in as many redundant systems as we can. Whereas the current EMU has a single pump, a single fan, all driven off of a single motor, if that system goes down, the EVAs finished. We have to bring the crew back inside. This system, we have redundant pumps. We have redundant fans. We have a redundant thermal control system. So we're trying to put in as much reliability as we can. Again, to allow the mission to keep going but also to obviously to protect the safety of the crew when they're out there. So the second thing that we've done, if you've seen lately we've had the crew do a lot of operations on this suit on the current EMU on board the space station. We've had them pull out fan pump separators which is kind of the very complicated heart of the EMUs life support system. And it was never meant to be operated on in space. It's difficult for our technicians to do it on the ground. It's even harder for the astronauts to do in space. We've had to teach them how to do it. We've had to be able to operate on the spacesuit. So this suit was designed with that in mind. All of the components on the suit are designed to be easily taken out and removed. One, to allow the crew members to operate so we don't have to bring those suits down to the ground necessarily to fix them. But in addition, technology changes quickly. And so we want to be able to take out components that are designed in the system and put in a new component, a different design into that, like a motherboard on a computer, PC. You plug in new designs as the latest and greatest chip comes out. We want our components to be upgradable, to change as we learn, as we get smarter, as this exploration program continues. We want to be able to upgrade the system as we go without having to design and develop a whole new suit and bring those suits back to the ground to change them out.  Host: Yeah, see that's huge. Because we're talking about one of the things for this Artemis mission, the idea is sustainability. So we're going to stay. So naturally that means years down the road technology's going to change. You don't want to be stuck with old suits. Having that sort of flexibility is awesome.  Chris Hansen: Exactly.  Host: We started talking about some of the different systems. We talked about portable life support systems. I know there's carbon dioxide scrubbing is actually being tested on the space station right now, isn't it?  Chris Hansen: Yep, absolutely.  Host: So how's it performing?  Chris Hansen: Yeah, so the swing bed that we have onboard station today has been working great. We flew a smaller payload that tested that out a few years ago. We had the typical problems with new technology. It took us a little while to get it working. But once we got it up and running, it worked fabulously. And so you know, I can't say enough about the space station and the role that it's played in allowing us to test these technologies in the real environment. We've learned so much, especially in the life support arena. The life support systems onboard space station are very complex and they've really allowed us to learn and grow and then it's expanded into things like spacesuits. Because a lot of our life support systems on the spacesuits are very similar to the life support systems the vehicles need, the space station and Orion. But in our case we have to make them smaller. But the technology is very similar and so those systems have been tested on station for a while and they've been working great.  Host: Yeah. They really are.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: We talked about the reliability of these, you know. Like you said, we've taken a lot from stuff that we know works on the space station and we've learned so much. Going down, I think, you know, controlling the life support systems -- I know one of the things on the extravehicular mobility unit on station is they have these control dials right at the front of their chest that help them to -- you talked about the cooling. Help them to cool off or heat up depending on where they are in the sun. Those look a little bit different on the xEMU, right?  Chris Hansen: Yeah. So what you're describing is what we call the display and control module. It's the control box on the front of the suit. Now that is how the crew interacts with the suit. There are switches on it and there are valves in there. There's a temperature control valve that affects how much cooling water is going to their cooling system to adjust the comfort levels of the crews inside. There are switches to turn on the pumps and fans and power and those things. So we still need the crew to be able to interact with the suit. However, one of the problems with that display and control module on the current EMU is how big it is. And it limited how small we could make the hard upper torso that that thing's attached to, sort of the chest part of the spacesuit. It limited how small we can make that, which then limited how easily smaller crew members could use them. You know, we've had discussions lately about our female astronauts and struggling in even our small suit. This will help us tremendously because we've made that system significantly smaller. It's allowed us to move the bearings inside farther. In addition, we started with -- when we designed the xEMU we started on the small side because the small one is the hardest one to integrate all these controls to. So we knew that it's easy to scale up. It's a lot harder to scale down. So we started with the small one. That display and control unit will give the crew messages about the suit status. It gives them switches that turn the systems on and off. And we're still evaluating today what kind of information we want the crew members to have. We have this great project that we do with university students called “Suits” where we're asking them to help us design the information system. We all love Iron Man. We're a big fan of Iron Man. A lot of things about Iron Man are fantasy. But one of the things that's not really fantasy is the way that in the movie he gets information from the suit.  Host: Yeah, like that heads-up display.  Chris Hansen: Heads-up display.  Host: Yeah.  Chris Hansen: The reality is when you look at that, that would be overwhelming probably for the average person. And so we're trying to study what kind of information do our astronauts want while they're doing an EVA. How do we want the suit to interact with them? Do we want them to be able to talk to the suit? Do we want the suit to talk back? Do we want gauges, dials, those kinds of things? So that's a lot of what we're studying now that will get integrated into the suit as we move forward.  Host: Oh man, Iron Man on the Moon. This is cool.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: The suit itself, we talked about -- I know one of the points during the presentation was about the pressure of the suit. Now I think the spacesuits on station are 4.3 PSI. Do I have that right?  Chris Hansen: Yeah. Yeah.  Host: This one is variable, right?  Chris Hansen: Yep, exactly.  Host: So what does that mean?  Chris Hansen: So one of the -- so you have to understand a little bit how the spacesuits work. If we ran the spacesuits at atmospheric pressure, 14.7 PSI, you'd never be able to move in them. The pressure, it's like being in a giant balloon. It would be so stiff, you'd never get any work done. So we have to lower the pressure in the suits enough to make the suits usable. The problem is if you lower the pressure of the suit down to 4 PSI and you just have regular breathing air in it, you would be unconscious very quickly. It would be very dangerous. The human body can't live in that condition. You can however live at that pressure if you're breathing pure oxygen. And so we fill those suits with pure oxygen. The downside with that is something called decompression sickness or the bends. If you're in a pure oxygen environment, you naturally have nitrogen in your blood. If you drop the pressure that low, just like scuba divers coming up too fast, the pressure is lowering too quickly. The nitrogen that's in your blood can come out of solution and make little bubbles. They get inside your systems and cause you a lot of problems. So the suit itself runs at low pressure but we have to run at pure oxygen at 4.2 PSI. Because of that, the crew members in the suit actually have to pre-breathe. So for several hours before the EVAs happen we put them on oxygen masks. They breathe pure oxygen to purge all of that nitrogen out of their body. It takes hours to do that. And ultimately we would like to not have to spend hours with the crew on pure oxygen before we go out and do spacewalks. One of the ways around that is by raising the pressure. If you can raise the pressure of the suit to something higher like 8 PSI, then the amount of time you need to spend pre-breathing on pure oxygen goes down dramatically. The problem is running a suit at 8 PSI is a little more complicated. It's stiffer, again. It's also -- in order to change the pressure you need something called an oxygen regulator. And there just really aren't oxygen regulators that are designed to change pressure. Until this project came on. So we worked with a company called Cobham and actually developed a very high-tech oxygen regulator that can actually change pressures. And so that's one of the features of the suit, is we can actually start the astronauts at a much higher pressure, get them out the door to go start exploring and then that regulator can actually lower pressure as they go. So that as the EVA goes on, the pressure gets lower, it gets a little easier to use the suits. But we didn't have to take all that time up front pre-breathing. So that technology allows us to be much more flexible as we plan EVAs.  Host: That is great. You get out the door faster but you can still have that extra mobility that you need to eventually bend over and pick up a rock.  Chris Hansen: Exactly.  Host: Perfect. Is the pre-breathing -- so it sounds like it's going to be shorter, but will the process of that be essentially the same? You're going to have to pre-breathe? You're going to have to don your suit? Because even now with spacewalks on the space station, it does take a while to get ready.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: So that will look the same on the lunar lander?  Chris Hansen: Fundamentally. But some of it's going to depend on how that lander gets designed. As you know, the agency has asked the commercial industry to propose lander designs and those landers have lots of flexibility in terms of how they meet that. You could theoretically run those landers with pure oxygen like we did back in the Apollo program. You could have the crew members breathe pure oxygen the way we do today. Again, because that time is less with the way the suit works, it gives you a lot more flexibility as to how you deal with that. But the lander companies that are developing the landers can kind of choose and figure out how to solve that problem and whatever makes most sense for their architecture. We try to give them as much flexibility by lowering the amount of time we need to pre-breathe. But then we'll see what -- we're interested. We'll see what designs they come up with, that they bring to NASA.  Host: Yeah, and then make it work.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: But you have this flexibility.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: This is awesome.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: I know I remember one part of the presentation too was something to look at was the differences with working and operating on the surface of the Moon. One of them was walking on the surface and possibly the thermal concerns on the boots.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: That was something you had to consider. Because I don't know if there's differences of temperature there.  Chris Hansen: Yeah. Obviously what we're walking on, the surface temperatures can vary in that wide range. So it's just something you have to deal with. There are materials available that can handle those kinds of temperatures. But like with every part of the suit we just have to look at what is the environment that we're going to be in? How well do we understand it? And then designing systems that can deal with it. I don't think from a materials standpoint the boots will be that tricky. I think we'll figure that out. One of the things we want though is we want them actually walking rather than hopping. So the shoes are probably going to have to be designed, the boots will have to be designed to be a little more rugged than what we had during Apollo. Because we want them again to be geologists. We want them to walk around.  Host: Yeah. Are there similar things for the gloves as well? Because now you're dealing with rocks that may or may not be sharp.  Chris Hansen: Yeah, we'll have to talk about that. One of the things is on the International Space Station, you mentioned it before, your legs aren't that helpful. And so almost all of the work you're doing is with your hands. And so we've designed what we call the phase six gloves that we use for the EMU. We've designed those to allow us to do very long, very hand-intensive EVAs on the International Space Station. There are some things we can improve on them that we're looking at, but they're pretty good. And so on the surface of the Moon -- on the surface of the Moon I don't think the effort for the geology work we're going to be doing is going to challenge the gloves more than the space station does in terms of the physical efforts.  Host: OK.  Chris Hansen: Now obviously we're going to have to deal with rocks and abrasion and some things we'll see. And so the outer layer is likely going to have to be toughened up. So we're looking at that. But fundamentally, particularly for these early missions, we will likely use the same phase six gloves.  Host: OK.  Chris Hansen: With maybe a different thermal overlay for thermal and abrasion resistance. But fundamentally the gloves are pretty good. There are some areas we definitely can improve, particularly on folks with smaller hands. The gloves are a little bulkier than we'd like them. So we've already started looking at ways to improve the flexibility of those gloves. That's one of those long-term things for us. We think the gloves will probably work fine for the early missions and then as we get smarter we'll evolve those gloves to make them a little more useful on the Moon. As we kind of learn the things we'll be doing on the surface of the Moon, we'll get smarter as we go. Again, this is a sustainable campaign. We want to go there and learn. And as we learn, we'll upgrade these systems to make them better.  Host: Perfect. We talked a little bit about the materials of the spacesuit. You already went through -- I think there was one that was thermal, right? So you have to design this suit to withstand these huge swings in temperatures. What about the logic of some of the other layers of the suit? Like I mean, you're dealing with pressure. You're dealing with extreme environments. Maybe a little bit of toughness to deal with the lunar dust. What are the logic of some of the layers of the suit?  Chris Hansen: Yeah, so we think -- so a lot of it is thermal control.  Host: OK.  Chris Hansen: Inside there's many layers in EMU. The most inner layer is the bladder and it actually has to hold pressure. Now our suits today, the EMUs also have to hold pressure. So we've learned a lot about how to do that. So we don't expect huge changes in that technology. Thermally we're also in very extreme thermal environments outside the International Space Station. You know, we orbit the earth and we come in and out of the sun essentially every 45 minutes so it gets very hot and very cold. So the suit was designed to deal with that. So the suit that you see on the Moon will have a lot of very similar materials in terms of that. Again, you talked about abrasions. So we'll have to deal with the dust and the rocks a little bit. We'll have to toughen up a few things. But we beat on our suits pretty good on the space station. So we've had to kind of already do that. We've made our gloves tougher over the years. The space station has lots of micrometeoroid hits that are sharp that crews have to deal with-- gloves. We've toughened the gloves up quite a bit. From a materials standpoint, I don't see anything major that'll be different in the new suits probably.  Host: OK. Now throughout suit history, there's been lessons learned and different designs. You know, if you look up an astronaut, the first thing you see is basically a spacesuit.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: So you see these differences in the way that the spacesuit is designed. And we've learned a lot. I have a couple notes here just from lessons learned and what you should and should not do when designing a spacesuit. One thing was no zippers or cables. What have we learned from that one?  Chris Hansen: Yeah. Some of that came from a lot of the Apollo program.  Host: OK.  Chris Hansen: The Apollo suits had zippers that formed a lot of the pressure.  Host: Yeah.  Chris Hansen: And they were a lot of trouble. The dust particularly got into -- the regolith got into the zippers and made it very difficult. We had a lot of cable failures, a lot of mechanism failures with dirt and really sharp fine dust getting into them. So at least for the lunar part we took a lot of lessons from that. Now that's obviously a problem we don't have to deal with onboard space station. But we remember a lot of the issues we had back in Apollo. So we've taken some of those design features that have caused those issues and we've tried to design them out. We've had failures of the EMU onboard space station. We talked about the EVA 23 event. And we've taken lessons from those failures and we've tried to incorporate features in the new suit that will help prevent those things.  Host: I see. Now some of those new suits -- you already talked about dust. Dust is a huge one. I know one of the things that really jump out at you when you're looking at this suit are -- you already talked about them a little bit -- are the bearings. You know, the shoulders are in a little bit more. It looks like you're almost like hunched forward a little bit. But it gives you that reach. And those bearings give you yes the mobility you talked about. Kris, whenever she was doing this demonstration reaching all the way across and touching her other shoulder.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: But there's also dust protection as part of those bearings as well, right? That's part of the design.  Chris Hansen: Yeah. So there's a couple layers. So one of the things -- the suit we needed to be as light as possible. One for the person that's in moving around that has to carry the mass around. But two, the vehicles, the landers themselves have limitations in terms of how much mass they can get down and back up off the surface. So because those bearings are metal, they're heavy. They're a heavy part of the suit. They give us a lot of functionality but there's a price to be paid for that, and that's in mass. So we've looked at making those bearings out of titanium. It's a little tricky from a bearing standpoint to make those work, but we've worked with titanium bearings a lot over the years. So we've kind of learned the secrets of how to make bearings out of it. So the bearings are titanium. There's also a lot of technology -- if you look at the military, they build a lot of moving machines and a lot of environments with dirt and dust and sand. And so they've learned a lot about how to protect bearings with shields and other things to protect the rolling elements that are inside those bearings. So these suits will incorporate a lot of that. We'll probably have a cover layer over the top of it that helps keep the dust from even getting to the bearings. So those are things that we've got to look at for sure. And we started a lot of that work, but there's definitely still some work to be done. And if the suits that we send to the Moon in '24 aren't perfect with that, we think that's OK. We'd like to not have to build a new spacesuit every time we go to the Moon. We'd like to make them reusable. But if the first ones aren't as perfect as we can make them, that's OK for these first couple missions. We'll get smarter and we'll upgrade them as we go with better bearing technology and other areas that we see that we're having trouble with.  Host: Yeah. Now in terms of the logic of the design, you've already alluded to this a little bit when we were talking about the control panel up front. But you mentioned there was a hard upper torso. And I believe the legs are soft material. Was there a reason for choosing those elements?  Chris Hansen: Yeah. That's the current design. The hard upper torso -- there's some other design concepts out there that have a less hard upper torso. Some of the challenges with that are we have to interface a lot of equipment with it. The life support system has to interface with it. The bearings, the bearings are hard. They have to be interfaced with it. And interfacing those to a hard upper torso is easier in some senses than a soft upper torso. We're still looking at all those concepts. But in the end that hard upper torso gives us a little more flexibility on how we attach things to it. Now we're going to make -- we're going to make that hard upper torso. We're looking at lots of different materials. The current EMU hard upper torsos are made out of fiberglass. We're looking at composites, carbon composite materials and some other more exotic things to try to make those things as light as we can. The one that you saw was made out of aluminum because it's easy to machine and it's easy for us to do conceptual studies with that. So as we look and evaluate those new materials, we have an aluminum one that lets us do other evaluations and show people how it moves and those kinds of things.  Host: Nice. Yeah. As you describe all of this, it gives me more and more of an appreciation from head-to- toe just how much thought had to go into all of this.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: One of the things actually you mentioned I think right up front when you were talking about designing again the control panel was you started small and then you went big. We're talking about different suit sizes.  Chris Hansen: Right.  Host: So how does that work? How is everything sized?  Chris Hansen: Yeah. So one of the things with the current EMU, there were limitations as to -- the initial program had lots of desires for a lot of different sizes. But financial constraints made them kind of limit the number of sizes they built. It kind of skewed it towards the upper end and it makes it difficult for our smaller astronauts which generally are the female astronauts, generally have-- less broad shoulders. And so it makes it a little more complicated to use the suits. They have to fight the suits a little more than someone that's got longer arms and broader shoulders. We'd like to fix that. We would like to enable all of our astronauts to be able to use this suit. So one of the things the suit does is by pulling the shoulders in the bearings are actually reversible so that we can get significant variation in shoulder width with a single hut design. There's harnessing and other features inside that allow a broad range of individuals to fit in a single size suit. And then ultimately what we'd like to do is fit a much wider population, you know, from fifth to 95th percentile. That's something that gets complicated because no human is any one of those things. Different parts of your body are different sizes. And so fitting actual people is much more complicated than just picking a fifth-percentile person or a 95th-percentile person. So we've done years of studying what people actually look like and how their bodies are built. This suit is designed to accommodate a very wide range of individuals with just two hard upper torso sizes because of the adjustability that we've built into the system.  Host: Wow.  Chris Hansen: As opposed to today on orbit we have three sizes of hard upper torsos and really could use more on the smaller end than we've got today. But we think we can accommodate a much larger range of people with just two hard upper torso sizes.  Host: That is awesome.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: What a detailed explanation of the xEMU. That was awesome. If you're ready to go into OCSS, we can do that, unless you want to --  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: OK. Let's go right into it. One of the highlighting I guess phrases that I pulled from the presentation was that the Orion Crew Survival Suit is tailored to the individual and to the vehicle. And what does that mean?  Chris Hansen: Yeah, so one of the things we want to do is -- one of the differences when we're doing an EVA, we've got a lot of work to do. But the crews don't spend more than about eight hours inside that suit. For the launch and entry suit, they potentially have to spend a lot of time in it. There are failure modes that they're looking at that will make a crew member potentially have to use that suit for up to six days.  Host: Wow.  Chris Hansen: So in a suit like that, it needs to fit really well. In addition, the pressure garment itself doesn't -- you don't have to accomplish as much as you would outside walking around on the surface of the Moon, so you don't need a lot of the bearings and things that we've put into our system. So it's the pressure garment part of it is simpler in a sense. So it's easier to custom build those suits per crew member. In addition, those suits have to be integrated. The way the protection system works for Orion is those suits are integrated very closely with the seats themselves. So those seats and the suits together create a system that make landing much safer in an Orion vehicle. We don't have to deal with that in the exploration suit. It's not something we're wearing during launch and entry and those kind of dynamic events. We don't have to protect the crew in the same way. This suit has to protect the crew members and so it makes sense to make the suits much more custom-fitting and really interact with the vehicle in a way that makes it much safer for all of the occupants.  Host: So what does that mean to integrate? Does that mean you have like a mold on the seat that's custom-fit to the person? What is the integration part?  Chris Hansen: Yeah, some of it has to do with just the sizes of the seat and the different panels.  Host: OK.  Chris Hansen: There's clips on the bottom of the feet that actually you clip your feet into the seats themselves to help restrain your feet. And there's other features. There's harnessing in there that works with the seat to make sure that the seatbelts fit you properly like that.  Host: OK. So I mean, for the most part when we're on these missions going to and from the Moon, the expectation is that it's a nominal situation. You put on the suit, you do your thing and you go to the Moon, you come back. But the crew, the suit is designed to protect you in the event of some contingency where you have to survive, you have to protect yourself.  Chris Hansen: Correct.  Host: So what does it look like in a nominal situation? What are you putting on? What are the layers? What's happening through the phases of flight?  Chris Hansen: Yeah, so they'll put on a suit. So the suit has a liquid cooling garment underneath similar to the EMU, although it just covers the chest area. We run cooling water from the vehicle. So the vehicle has a heat exchanger that will run cool water through the suit so the crew members will be comfortable. You'll put on an undergarment then you'll put the suit on, just really on the ground before you get in the vehicle. You put this on. You'll put on gloves, you'll put on a helmet. So it's less complicated than getting into the xEMU. There's less interfaces to it. So it's really like putting on a flight suit in a sense that typical pilots use in airplanes.  Host: OK. Now I think, you know, it will be used to protect the astronauts in some sort of event that were to occur. Now in transit to the Moon, you don't necessarily need it the whole time, right? That's going to be a couple days long.  Chris Hansen: No. In fact, they'll take that suit off.  Host: Yeah.  Chris Hansen: The suit is designed for really launch. And then when they get to a stable position in orbit, they'll take the suit off and they'll be in a shirtsleeve environment for most of the time. It's there and there are requirements that the vehicle has to protect that crew for up to an hour if there's a depressive incumbents, there's time to get into those suits and safe themselves before a catastrophic event happens.  Host: OK. Now the reason that we have the suit, right, catastrophic events, something were to happen.  Chris Hansen: Yeah  Host: Let's say it's a decompression event. What would the crew be doing to get ready, to start getting into survival mode and put the suit on and start? You know, would they plug into -- you said they use the life support systems of Orion.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: So would they plug in that way?  Chris Hansen: Yep. They would put on the suit and they would plug in.  Host: OK.  Chris Hansen: There will be umbilicals attached to the suit and they'll plug into the vehicle.  Host: OK.  Chris Hansen: And fundamentally because you don't have much time to do it, the first crew member has to be able to get into that suit within 30 minutes. So you don't have a lot of time. You'll put the suit on, you'll plug in, you'll do leak checks and you'll make sure everything's working fine and then you'll be set.  Host: OK.  Chris Hansen: So it's designed to be flexible and get you to that safe state as quickly as you can.  Host: In the vehicle, right, would you be in your seats in this situation?  Chris Hansen: No, not in that situation. You'll be floating around. You wouldn't get into the seats. Really you'd be in the seats really just for landing for reentry and landing.  Host: I see.  Chris Hansen: There's no reason to be in those seats unless you were reentering.  Host: So you'd be able to move about the cabin just in the suit.  Chris Hansen: Just in the suit.  Host: Plugged in?  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: OK.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: Now you have to live in the suit, right?  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: You said worst-case scenario you've got to live in the suit for six days.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: Now what does that mean? What does it mean to live in the suit?  Chris Hansen: So think about it, so what are the things that keep you alive? Number one is you've got to be able to breathe.  Host: Yeah.  Chris Hansen: And so you've got to be hooked up to the oxygen system of the vehicle, so the vehicle has to be able to provide oxygen to those crew members. Now if you're in a depressed vehicle, your suit is now -- your suit is acting like a spacesuit in the sense that you have zero pressure on the outside. The suit is designed to operate between four and eight PSI of pure oxygen. So we have to feed pure oxygen in to that crew member. Now the vehicle does all of the functions we talked about. And the xEMU, the Orion vehicle has to do that for the crew. It's got to scrub CO2 out of that system and it's got to provide oxygen. It's got to provide cooling water to them. So it's got to keep them alive. So that's the first thing. Second need is food. So you've got to be able to -- food and water. So you've got to be able to drink and eat. So you've got to do that. And then you have to get rid of bodily waste. And so the system is designed to make that possible for six days. That's a very complicated part of the suit you've got to be able to get rid of, urine and fecal matter and all those things. So lots of work went into designing this suit that you could actually survive in for up to six days in that condition. It's an incredibly challenging task for those guys.  Host: Yeah.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: We talked about decompression. We mentioned smoke, fire, basically this would -- in any of these you have to think through. We actually had a podcast about it.  Chris Hansen: OK.  Host: Jason Hutt came on and talked about a lot of these different things. And it was about, you know, if this were to go wrong, what would you do? The suit is designed in any phase of flight to do that. Let's skip ahead to landing. Because I know there's parts of the suit that even after landing would help you survive in the ocean for a little bit.  Chris Hansen: Yeah, so they've got an integrated life -- inflatable lifesaving device that will inflate when they hit the water. That will keep them afloat, keep their head above water. You've got a lot of typical -- we've got lots of experience with search and rescue in the ocean environment. So we've got lights and there's a satellite beacon that's being designed that will stay above the water that will talk to a satellite system so we can find the crew members. Lights, glow sticks, those kinds of things that you would see in a typical marine environment. The suit's a dry suit. It's got a neck dam so that it'll keep the crew from getting wet which will help keep them warmer. Now we're not landing in the North Atlantic Ocean, so that helps. So they're likely to be in a little bit warmer water. But it can be down in the 50-degree range, so you wouldn't want to spend a lot of time in it wet. So the suit's designed to deal with that environment and protect them until we can get to them and rescue.  Host: There you go. That's why it's called the Orion Crew Survival Suit.  Chris Hansen: There you go.  Host: They're going to help them survive.  Chris Hansen: Yep.  Host: What fascinating pieces of technology. Let's go into the development and testing.  Chris Hansen: Yeah, OK.  Host: Because we've talked about all the different features of this suit. Tell me about the history. Let's start with the xEMU because that's what you've been looking at for the most part. How you've developed this suit to be what it is and test it where you've tested it, those sorts of things.  Chris Hansen: Yeah, so it's an interesting history with the spacesuit. We've had like -- we've talked about we've had the EMU since the early '80's. And so we've known that the agency needed a new spacesuit. The EMU wasn't going to work -- we've only got 11 of them in existence. The technology is very old. We spent a lot of time as technology gets older trying to figure out how to keep it working. Obsolescence becomes an issue for a lot of the materials and electronics and those kinds of things. So we've known for quite a while that we needed a new spacesuit. However, there hasn't been a destination by the agency for a while. When the Constellation program was set up, there was a suit program, a contract was let for that so there's a company that was out, a company called Oceaneering was off developing a spacesuit for Constellation. So they got quite a ways down the line to the point where we call preliminary design review before the Constellation program was cancelled. But we knew that no matter where we were going, whether it was the Moon or Mars or cislunar space or Lagrange Point or anywhere, we were going all the way to Mars, down to the surface of Mars, we were going to need a new suit. So a lot of really smart spacesuit engineers got together with industry inside NASA, outside NASA to talk about, “OK, given that we could go any of these places, what technology should we put in a new spacesuit?” And we came up with a list that everybody agreed on and we started working on all of those technologies. And so as we got through all the different phases of building test units and we'd test them and they'd break and we'd make it a little bit better and we'd kind of work through that, that's been going on for almost a decade. And then two years ago we made a decision to build the suit to go test on the International Space Station. One of the things with the space station, officially its end of life is 2024. It is the best place to test spacesuits in the entire universe right now. And so we wanted to make sure our new spacesuit, all this new technology got tested in space before the space station retired. So two years ago we made a plan to build a flight unit to go test it on the International Space Station. So we've been working on that suit for two years. It was perfect timing. When the agency, when the country decided, when the president gave us the challenge to go back to the Moon in 2024, we were two years into our project already for a suit that was designed to work on space station. But it was also designed to work on the surface of the Moon. We already thought ahead that this suit needed likely to be able to do that. And so this suit already had most of what it needed in its design. So a lot of what we do -- so then we got together and we talked about requirements. That's always where you start. And that's really asking the question, \"Are we building the suit that we need?\" So we talk about, what does this suit need to do? So we define all those requirements and we make sure that we're all in agreement on that. Then we go start building. The current suit today is at what we call a preliminary design review state. That's a state where we kind of say, \"OK, we've looked at the requirements. We have a design we think meets all of those requirements, and this is what that design looks like.\" We haven't built it all yet. We haven't tested it all. But this is the design that we think will work. We have lots of experts in the room and we talk about that design and see, do we agree that we've met the suit's going to work? So we've completed that for this suit. We just completed a couple months ago. So now the team has to take all that input and then go start actually designing the final one. That will lead into what we call a critical design review where we say, \"OK, we've got a design. We're about ready to go build one. Do we have the right design?\" And then once we have that right design, then we'll go start building what we call a qualification unit. And then we'll test that suit in all of the boundary conditions, the extreme cases that we want the suit to work at, that we hope never to put an actual suit through with a crew member in it. But we check and make sure the design works. That's called a critical design review. We're about a year, probably about a year out for the xEMU from that. And then we'll start qualification testing, then we'll build the flight units, we'll test those and we'll send them to the Moon. So for the xEMU, that's where we're at. We just finished our preliminary design phase. Now the team's off working really hard to put those designs together.  Host: Well awesome. I mean, so the suit we saw was essentially what it will be but just maybe through these extra reviews you would find little things here and there that you want to fix before you actually put a person in it on the Moon.  Chris Hansen: Yeah, exactly. And there's a lot of work going from a conceptual design or design that works in a lab to an actual working physical flight unit that's been tested and qualified to work in these extreme environments very reliably. There's a lot of work getting between those two points. And that's what our teams are going to do. Now the Orion suit's a little farther along. They're actually at -- they've completed their critical design review. So they have a design that's already set and they're getting ready to build their flight unit. So they're quite a bit ahead of us. The Orion vehicle should fly sooner than we're going to need our suits.  Host: Alright.  Chris Hansen: So they are ahead of us.  Host: Now in terms of the xEMU, I remember Kate Rubins on the same panel that you were at talking about -- she put it on and went into the neutral buoyancy laboratory, this big pool we have at the Johnson Space Center.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: And she was praising it, talking about how awesome it was.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: So that was one of the tests you did to actually check out, hey, how's this thing -- is this thing as maneuverable as we think we designed it to be?  Chris Hansen: Yeah. What's great is being here at JSC where we have the astronauts. We have a whole group of astronauts who have done actual EVAs. They've done training in the pool, the neutral buoyancy lab. They've done actual EVAs in space with an EMU. They've got a ton of experience. Having access to those astronauts is a huge advantage to us. So when we take an astronaut like Kate who's done EVAs -- she's done two EVAs in space -- and put her in this new suit and we asked her, \"OK, what's different between this suit and the EMU?\" And she can give us really good, valuable feedback on the differences. We built a pressure garment, put Kate in it. We've done over 20 runs in the neutral buoyancy lab with this suit, and the reviews have been fabulous by her. She said the mobility -- again we're not testing the life support system in the pool.  Host: Sure.  Chris Hansen: But we're testing the pressure garment and the mobility in those features, and we're getting rave reviews from all the astronauts. The astronauts and our engineers and ops team that are given the suits, and they've done a lot of work in both. Lots of good feedback telling us that the suit design -- we're heading in the right direction that it works really well.  Host: Perfect. A lot more ground testing you did, I think. Is there elements of the suit that's being tested on space station right now?  Chris Hansen: Yeah, for sure. One of the most important technologies in the suit we talked about, the suit water membrane evaporator. It's a brand new technology that we've never flown in space. And so it was one of I'll say the highest-risk areas in terms of new technology. So we made a decision a couple years ago that we wanted to take that technology and use the space station to test it. So we took that entire thermal system part of the suit and we put it in a box and we designed it to go into a payload rack onboard the International Space Station. That box in the payload rack on space station will simulate exactly the environment that our spacesuit will be in for this thermal control system. So we're going to actually run the cooling system. We have water that we'll put into it. That water will put heat in it just like an astronaut would. We'll subject it to vacuum just like the suit will see onboard space station. And it will allow us to get a good probably year of testing onboard the space station of our thermal control system which is again probably the lowest technology readiness level of any part of the suit. So we wanted to get on station. So that payload is actually going through its final qualification now. It should be ready to fly in a couple of months and so we'll launch it to space station early next year. And so we'll be testing parts of the spacesuit within the next six months onboard space station.  Host: Wonderful. Yeah, let's take the timeline now to 2024. We're looking to have a person on the Moon. What are we looking to do? Are we talking like a full-up test on the International Space Station with the whole suit doing a spacewalk? What are we looking forward to here?  Chris Hansen: So there's a couple phases. We have the first thing that we're building -- we used to call them engineering development units. We call this the development test unit. We're actually building to the best of our knowledge today what the suit design looks like. We're building a DVT [Development verification test] unit, a spacesuit that has all the technology and features that we want. That suit will be assembled and ready early next calendar year. So really within the next six to eight months we'll have that suit ready to go. Now that suit gives us a chance to test all of these features. We can run tests with it. We can put it in a vacuum chamber to make sure that when we set the final design and CDR [Critical design review] that we have all this data with an actual spacesuit. So we're going to do that testing over the next year. Then we're going to build -- then we'll start building the qualification unit. We're going to build two of them at this point is the plan, that allow us to do testing in parallel. The 2024 schedule's pretty aggressive for us. And we had a head start which helped, but it's still pretty aggressive. So by building two units it allows us to do testing in parallel a little bit. We're going to build those qualification units. Those qualification units will require us to take actual human beings and put them in actual vacuum chambers with this suit and test the life support system. So they'll be very complex, potentially hazardous tests with humans involved in the test to make sure the suits work. We want to put that suit through as rigorous a test as we can on the ground before we send astronauts up and ask them to use it.  Host: Sure.  Chris Hansen: So the qualification testing will happen. Once we get through the qualification testing program, we'll have a flight suit. And with the flight suit -- we'll build a flight suit. We don't want to test those suits to these extreme boundary conditions. We want them -- we do that with the qualification units. And with the flight suits we want to take care of them on the ground. So we put them through a limited set of tests to make sure that they work. We will test those. We'll put a crew member in those suits in a vacuum chamber on the ground to test them and make sure they're working. Then the plan is this: we're going to take a single flight suit and we're going to launch it to the International Space Station. And we're going to do an EVA with a regular EMU and an xEMU side-by-side. We are already in the process of modifying the space station systems to allow it to service an xEMU. We need higher-pressure oxygen. We need access to a vacuum line. So we're modifying the station right now. Those designs are happening. So we'll do that EVA. The idea is to check out that suit on space station before we get to the surface of the Moon. How the schedule works out, we'd like to get that test done on space station before we get to the Moon, but depending on the timing of that we may or may not -- that may or may not happen. At the same time we're building that suit we'll build two more suits that will then go to the lander companies or however we launch those suits to get them. Likely they'll get launched to Gateway separately. They'll be at Gateway waiting for the lander to come. When the lander shows up at Gateway, we'll transfer those suits over to the lander and then those are the suits that will go down to the surface of the Moon for the first mission.  Host: OK. Yeah, that is aggressive.  Chris Hansen: Yeah, 2024.  Host: You have a lot of work ahead of you. I'm sure the team is really trucking along. It's a great team, I'm assuming.  Chris Hansen: Yeah, 2024 seems like a long ways away until you start thinking about all these tests and how long they take to run. And then it seems a lot closer. We have a countdown clock we actually use of when we have to deliver the suits.  Host: Now what about the OCSS? I'm going to have to get used to calling it that, but the Orion Crew Survival one.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: Is that one being tested on Artemis too when we fly people?  Chris Hansen: Yeah, I think that's their plan, yeah.  Host: OK.  Chris Hansen: They'll use the suit. Again, they're through their critical design review already so they'll have those suits read for whenever we put crew members on the Orion vehicle. They'll have these suits. You have to have a launch and entry suit for safety reasons.  Host: Right.  Chris Hansen: And this suit was designed to be there ready for them whenever Orion was ready to fly. So they'll have that. They've already undergone vacuum testing with the suits and their system, so they've done a lot of what they call human in the loop testing with those suits. Again, so they're a bit ahead of us in terms of that. But yeah, they'll have those suits whenever crew fly on Orion. They'll be wearing those suits.  Host: Perfect. There's a lot to look forward to.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: I did want to end with this one thing. And this was actually I think asked during your presentation. You know, we're talking about -- especially for the xEMU, this suit being designed, we have all these steps to go for the Moon. And there's a lot of challenges for the Moon.  Chris Hansen: Yeah.  Host: But what about Mars? You know, this has always been a distant goal of ours. But what can we learn from the Moon or what would need to change from the design of these suits to go from a suit that's walking on the Moon to a suit that's walking on Mars?  Chris Hansen: Yeah. Fundamentally there's a lot of technology that's in these suits that will help us go to Mars. Particularly in terms of what do we need to do with these suits and how do the crews interact with them. There are some challenges for Mars that we're going to have to figure out. Mars has an atmosphere. It's a CO2, low-pressure CO2 primarily atmosphere. So our CO2 system that dumps CO2 into the atmosphere doesn't have vacuum associated. So we have to figure out how to get rid of that CO2. Our current system won't work exactly the same way. Maybe a variant of the system will work. We have to start thinking about that. The cooling system will work differently with an atmosphere. Our cooling system depends on us evaporating water into vacuum and there's no vacuum there. So it won't be as efficient. So we'll have to find ways to make these systems a little more efficient. The thermal environment is likely to be different with that atmosphere. I don't know whether it's better or worse yet, but our teams will have to go figure out what are the changes in the new environment. I think we're going to learn a lot by building a suit that's going to be directly applicable to Mars. And then very quickly, as soon as we get past the design for the lunar phase, we'll start thinking about ways to test and develop those new systems. So we'll be ready when we're ready to go to Mars. We'll have a suit that's ready that can do it.  Host: Wonderful. This is an incredible time.  Chris Hansen: Yeah, it's exciting.  Host: Chris Hansen, thank you so much for coming on the podcast and talking about these suits for Artemis.  Chris Hansen: Excellent. Thanks for having me.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host):  Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, episode 48, Moon Rocks.  I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today.  So, in this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know the coolest information about what's going on right here at NASA.  So, today, we're talking to the keeper of all moon rocks in the world, Ryan Zeigler.  Well, technically, they're all held here at the Johnson Space Center by NASA in the Lunar Curation Facility.  But Ryan is the lunar sample curator here in Texas and he's also a planetary scientist.  We had a great discussion about moon rocks, like the reason why we brought them back from moon during the Apollo Program, more about the facilities that keep them, and also what we're still learning from them.  So, with no further delay, let's go lightspeed and jump right ahead to our talk with Dr. Ryan Zeigler.  Enjoy.    [ Music ]    Host:   Ryan, thanks for taking the time to come on the podcast today.  I can't believe it, but we're actually finally going to talk about moon rocks.    Ryan Zeigler:  I know, I mean you'd think this was a cursed subject or something.    Host:  Well, it's interesting because -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- all of the moon rocks that were collected on the Apollo missions are here, correct?    Ryan Zeigler:  Most of our here, about -- about 85% are here or maybe 80% are here, 5% are out with scientists, and about 15% are at a secret remote storage facility at White Sands, so --    Host:  Oh, okay.    Ryan Zeigler:  Not that secret, I guess, so.    Host:  The secret's out now.  Okay.  So -- but -- but the moon rocks were collected on just human missions, right, not robotic missions?    Ryan Zeigler:  For NASA, yes.    Host:  Okay.  Okay.  So, were there other lunar acquisition -- like robotic ones?    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah, so the Soviets had three Luna missions -- Luna 16, 20, and 24, and they collected about a pound of samples.    Host:  Oh, really?    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah.  Yeah.    Host:  Robotically?    Ryan Zeigler:  Robotically, yup.    Host:  Okay.  Very cool.  Must have been a different profile.  But we went a couple times, right?  We did -- we did Apollo, you know, 11 through 17.    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah.  We had six missions that landed on the surface.    Host:  Exactly.  All right, a lot of moon rocks.  So.  So, let's talk about moon rocks, themselves, because, you know, how I imagine it is just, you know, gray rocks.  But I'm sure -- and I'm sure as -- from a geologist's perspective, there are interesting ones and there are -- there are not so interesting ones.  And there was -- there was just some decision-making that went with the acquisition of them.    Ryan Zeigler:  No, absolutely.  And you're right, though.  If you look at moon rocks, most of them are kind of boring to look at.  I mean they have a bit of an image problem.  Most of them are sort of gray rocks but there's a few things about them that really set them apart.  They're really old.  They formed on a body with no atmosphere, so there's a lot of micrometeorite impacts into them.  There's a lot of things that set them apart from Apollo's -- from terrestrial samples.  And so, they are really interesting to scientists for a lot of those reasons, yeah.    Host:  For sure, definitely.  So, some of the first ones were collected from NASA on Apollo 11, right?    Ryan Zeigler:  Yes.    Host:  Awesome.  So, how much -- do you know how much they collected?    Ryan Zeigler:  It's about 25 kilograms, so about -- a little over 50 pounds.    Host:  All right.    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah.    Host:  But I guess it felt different when they were actually collecting it.    Ryan Zeigler:  Well 1/6 as much.  Yeah.  I know.  I mean everyone was super strong on the moon and it was great.  You could jump super high, except for the spacesuits, I think.    Host:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So, what did they used to collect it?  Was it kind of bending over and picking it up or was it --    Ryan Zeigler:  Well, they couldn't bend over very well and that was good for us because that kept them from touching them with their gloved hands because the gloves were a source of contamination.  So, they had specially designed tools made out of either stainless steel or aluminum.  And so, they -- like, basically one of those long claw things you see that -- like the t-rex with the two claw things, that's kind of like that, only NASA, so it was made of steel.    Host:  Okay.    Ryan Zeigler:  And then they had sieves and they had some rakes.  And so, they had a couple different instruments -- tools to help them collect them.    Host:  Okay.  And that was all planned ahead of time.  They knew that the -- did they understand the surface of the moon before they went?    Ryan Zeigler:  They understood it pretty well.  What they didn't -- they underestimated how important the impacts were on the surface.  And on Earth, impacts are a relatively minor thing because we've got an atmosphere.  So, you see shooting stars at night and that's little sand sized stuff being burned up.  On the moon, all of that stuff, it's the moon going several kilometers per second.  So, it's a much finer grained place and there's just -- yeah.  So, the tools they use evolved over time.  On Apollo 11, they had one set.  And by Apollo 17, they had a much more evolved set.  They learn from being there and sort of redesigned them on the fly, so to speak.    Host:  Okay.  That makes sense.  You go on the surface and you have people actually using the tools and then providing real-time feedback.    Ryan Zeigler:  Exactly.    Host:  Hey, this worked, this didn't.  I need this bigger, this smaller, this longer, whatever, so.  Okay, that makes a lot of sense.  So, when they collected them, what was that process like?  Did they kind of put it into bags and seal them up or was it like a bin?    Ryan Zeigler:  On Apollo 11 especially, because they didn't collect that many rocks, I mean 50 pounds sounds like a lot, but rocks are heavy.  So, they had a special box with a metal-on-metal knife edge seal that allowed them to seal them away.  And so, they would collect them with the tool, put it inside a Teflon bag, roll up the bag, and then the bag would go in the box.    Host:  Okay.    Ryan Zeigler:  And then at the end of Apollo 11, just before they were sealing them up to put them inside, Neil Armstrong looked at it and thought that the box looked kind of empty, so he got his shovel out and literally just shoveled a bunch of dirt into the box around all of the other samples.    Host:  Really?    Ryan Zeigler:  It's -- almost as an afterthought.  And it ended up being like 11 kilograms or something.  And it being almost a quarter of the sample they brought back.    Host:  Whoa.    Ryan Zeigler:  And it ended up being the largest single sample from Apollo 11 and probably one of the most important.  And it was just -- he just looked at it and thought, this is silly, I'm going to go all the way to the moon and I'm going to bring back a half-full box of rocks.  So, he shoveled some dirt in, sealed it up, and that came back.  On later mission, when they started collecting more rocks and would fit in the rock boxes, some of them came back just in the Teflon bags, sealed up tight, like cookies or coffee or something.  But those probably saw a little bit of atmosphere.    Host:  Oh, okay.  So, the idea was to protect it from the Earth's atmosphere, once it got back, to avoid.    Ryan Zeigler:  Exactly.  But the boxes are heavy and so they couldn't bring 10 boxes to bring back all those samples.  So, they decided that for some samples, just being sealed up and minor exposure to air would be okay.    Host:  Okay.  So, why did the dirt ended up being one of the more important pieces of Apollo 11?    Ryan Zeigler:  Well, one of the things they didn't realize -- because the impacts are so important on the moon, and a lot of the material just gets spread around.  And so, the dirt -- the soil -- the regolith, official -- is the technical name for it -- is a really good average composition of a large area on the moon, whereas the rocks mostly come from that local area.  So, you collect the rocks, you learn a lot about the local area.  You collect the soil, you learn about the local area, but also exotic stuff coming from farther away.  And it being so big, and hey, us having so much of it, everyone wanted Apollo samples when they came back, and obviously, we had a very limited mass.  And so, them bringing back more than they expected opened up new studies just based on mass availability.  And we also used those as a goodwill sample.  We -- every country on Earth in 1970 got a piece of the moon as a gift that came from that soil -- that big shoveled soil.  They took out the bigger particles, put them in plastic, took some flags they had flown to the moon, put it on a plaque, and they just handed it out to everybody.  It was great, yeah.    Host:  I wish I --    Ryan Zeigler:  All because -- all because Neil thought to shovel in a [inaudible] we're real close, so.  I call him Neil, so.  No, I mean all because he had the -- you know, the foresight to do something like that.    Host:  Exactly.  So, what was interesting about the Sea of Tranquility, whenever they were picking the location for Apollo 11?    Ryan Zeigler:  Honestly, I think it really came down to safety.  I mean they had some really strict constraints.  They -- first time, they wanted something near the equator, so they used less Delta V, less fuel.  They wanted something flat, so they'd have to worry about landing on, you know, a crater, which they almost did anyway, and they had to avoid it.  So, a lot of it came down to it had to be on the equator and it had to be flat.  And then they used spectroscopy.  They looked at the light and it was bouncing off the surface and trying to find a place that was slightly unusual.  And it turned out, Sea of Tranquility had a lot of titanium in it.  And so, the light bouncing off it looked a little different and so they thought, let's go try that place.  And then when they went to 12, they had similar constraints, but they went to the other end of the spectrum.  And they got low titanium basalts.  And so, you know, science wasn't driving the landing sights at that point, but they were still trying to maximize how much science they could get out of it.    Host:  Right and, you know, priority one was safety.  Priority two was all right, in terms of the safest areas we could land, this one is also --    Ryan Zeigler:  Exactly, that's how they did it.  Yeah.    Host:  Okay.  Cool.  So, what's -- what was interesting about titanium then?    Ryan Zeigler:  On Earth -- I mean this is sort of a technical detail that almost no one's going to care about.  But on Earth, you know, basalts only have a weight percent of titanium, 1% titanium.  And on the moon, that's 8 or 9% titanium, and it tells you about the interior of the moon and what was melting to form these basalts.  And it's quite different than Earth.  And so, it was telling us about how the moon formed and evolved, all from one rock on the surface.  And it wasn't the whole story, but it sure got things moving in the right direction.    Host:  All right.    Ryan Zeigler:  Otherwise, we've been wasting our time for 45 years.    Host:  Well, then so that was just a piece of the story.  And then you went to -- we went to different areas to kind of let -- you know, we have these Apollo missions, let's use them to our fullest advantage.  Let's figure out this story of the moon.  So, what were some of the decisions -- and you said Apollo 12 was lower titanium -- but what were some of the other decisions for the later missions?    Ryan Zeigler:  So, for the later missions -- if you look up at the moon at night -- and this is super basic, but there's dark parts and light parts.  And the first two missions went to the dark parts, those are mare basalts, like you would get in Hawaii.  And then there was the bright parts, which actually make up about 80% of the moon, so they need -- they were like, we need to go to one of these bright parts and see what make up the Highlands.  And so, same constraints, Apollo 14 landed pretty close to Apollo 12, near the equator, but in the Highlands.  And then they got those samples back and realized, wow, everything's an impact, everything's a breccia, a rock made of pieces of other rock.  It's like a jigsaw puzzle almost.  And then after that, when they got to 15, 16, and 17, those were the J missions, so they had a Rover, they had much more -- better suits, they had a lot of other stuff.  And so, then they were able to go to more technically challenging sites that were, at the junction, between the bright parts and the dark parts mostly.  And so, also, I mean I'm sure you know this and all of the pilot -- all of the Apollo astronauts are pretty much test pilots.  So, just landing on a flat bit, I don't think he was doing it for them.  And so, Apollo 15 and Apollo 17, when you hear the astronauts talk about what it was like to land there, like landing in this little narrow valley on Apollo 17, and Apollo 15 landing and coming over this huge mountain.   And then having to get down really fast and land onto -- before the big canyon.    Host:  Canyon.    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah.  You know, and so, you know, they were able to do more technically challenging things with flying too.    Host:  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, that was -- that was their thing, right?    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah.    Host:  But then on -- was it Apollo 17, Jack Schmitt, now you finally have a geologist, right?    Ryan Zeigler:  Right.  I mean, and Jack had played a really important part.  I mean Jack comes to all of our science conferences.  Jack has PhD in geology.  He's way smarter than I'll ever be, and he still comes to all of the -- all of the conferences and many, many, many a debate ends with, well, when I was on the moon -- and that's when you know you've lost the argument because he's really [inaudible].  You know, you don't get to use that.  No, Jack was there.  And so, he was able to help select the sites but when they were on the ground, he was -- you know, everyone got a -- basically a master's degree in geology as part of their training.  But he already had a PhD and was one of those people who trained the other astronauts in geology.  And so, he really was able to spot and collect things from a different perspective.    Host:  Okay.  And was -- did he have a part in deciding where they were going to land and what things to pick up and bring back?    Ryan Zeigler:  I'm sure he did.  And I mean he started to tell a story at a meeting a couple months ago, about well, that's not how we selected that site.  And he never finished the story, so I don't have the whole story yet.  But I don't think the sites were selected that far ahead of time.  As they were leading up to a new mission, the scientists and Jack, because he's one of the scientists, would get together and talk about where they wanted to go from science priorities.  And then the mission safety people would be like, yeah, we're not landing in the middle of Tycho Crater, that's crazy, and then there would be some back-and-forth.  And -- but yeah, no, Jack was definitely part of that discussion.    Host:  Okay cool.  So, what were -- what were some of the -- besides titanium -- what were some of the more interesting things that you found?  Because there's a finite number of samples we have from the moon, right?  So, what are -- were some of the most interesting things that we found from those samples?    Ryan Zeigler:  Well, they're really old.  I mean -- and that's -- that sounds very basic.  But essentially, every rock from the moon is older than every rock on Earth.  It's not perfectly true.  There's some overlap in the middle.  There's like four places on Earth where they're that old.  But it turns -- so the moon is just an ancient body.  The fact that everything was either a volcanic process of basalts, like what you'd see in Hawaii, or breccia, something from impact, that threw people off.  There was no water on the moon and that's not true anymore.  But compared to terrestrial rocks, which every rock you pick up on Earth has a mineral with water in it and they couldn't find any water in lunar samples until about 10 years ago.  And it was only when instruments had evolved to the point where they could measure lower concentrations and new scientists came along and said, this doesn't make sense.  We need to re-examine these.  And so, there was a little bit of missed from earlier.  But the moon is a very dry place and that throws people off.    Host:  So, you said there's-- parts of it, you said it's not true anymore.  Ten years ago, we discovered there's a little bit of water on the moon.  What was the instrument that found that and where is it?    Ryan Zeigler:  It was something called the SIMS, the secondary ion mass spectroscopy.  And so, what you do is you take the sample, you bombard the surface with ions, either positively or negatively charged, and then that sputters off what's there.  And before, we were using an electron probe, where you're doing essentially the same thing, but with electrons.  And they just -- they started looking at a mineral called apatite and on every other planet where you find that mineral, there's water in it.  And then when they started looking at it on the moon, there was a fair amount of water in it.  And so -- and it was one of those cases where the analytical instruments in the '70s were very good, and Apollo helped revolutionized them.  But the little bit of water -- the little bit that was missing, they just assumed was analytical error, and it was very hard to directly detect water because you're not doing it by mass, you're doing it by energy and so -- anyway.  So, they -- so this -- these new instruments -- which weren't new in the -- in the 2000s.  They were invented in the -- in the '80s.  But by the 2000s, when new scientists came along, that's when they started to figure it out.    Host:  Okay.  Isn't it also true that there are -- on the polar ends of the moon, there are [inaudible] shaded areas that have I guess never seen the Sun, are their deposits of water there too?    Ryan Zeigler:  Almost certainly.  We have limited direct evidence of that, but we have a lot of circumstantial evidence.  There's extra hydrogen there, so what's the hydrogen there as?  They -- you get a different radar back scatter out of there and one of the only things that causes that is ice.  And so, they did have the L Cross mission, which landed in one of these permanently shadowed regions, put up a plume of debris, and then it flew through it.  And they did detect water, and so we do have some direct evidence, but -- so that's a different kind of water.  So, I'm talking about water that came from the interior of the -- of the -- of the planet.  And the water that's at the poles probably is from comets and meteorites slamming into the surface over time.  And the ice that's in that, sort of migrating along the surface, and then freezing down in these cold areas.  And so, I -- you know, I'm talking about intrinsic water to the moon versus external water.  The external water might be more interesting for like refueling spacecraft someday.  Intrinsic water, it's very minor and so it's always going to be of geologic interest, but probably not economic importance.    Host:  I see.  So, when you say that you were looking at rocks and using these instruments to find little -- you know, use a different type of method to discover the water inside the rock, that was here on Earth, right?  That was here --    Ryan Zeigler:  All of that was done on Earth.  In fact, the -- in Apollo missions -- I mean you see the Mars missions now and they have Rovers and they do all these cool measurements on the -- on Mars, they didn't do that on Apollo.  They had some surface experiments where they did some geophysical experiments on the surface, but that was on the moon, as a whole, and not on the rocks.  The rocks were really not studied until they came back because anything they might have done on the surface could be done much better back on Earth.  And since they knew they were bringing the rocks back anyway, they didn't spend any mass, or time, or energy on that.  They just collected the rocks and brought them back.    Host:  Plus, you risk the chance of contamination.    Ryan Zeigler:  Exactly.  I mean we have a lot of talk now about, you know, what could be done on samples like on the way back and the answer is always like, don't touch the samples, just bring them back.  Just don't touch the samples.  We'll do it when you get them back here.  And we is not me, and we is not NASA.  We, is this -- the larger scientific community on the planet.  And so, I keep using the royal we.  And as my dad always asked, do you have a mouse in your pocket?  No, it's just, you know, it's a very large and active science community that studies all these samples.    Host:  Well, and the -- and one of the more important parts about that is there is a finite number of samples that you have, right?    Ryan Zeigler:  There is.  There is.    Host:  So, whenever they're bringing these samples back, the story from the Apollo days, what were some of the facilities that they were bringing them back to?  What were some of the methods to make sure that they were acquired safely and properly?    Ryan Zeigler:  So, they had designed Building 37 here at Johnson Space Center was the Lunar Receiving Lab and they finished that in 1967, so a couple years before it came back.  Because they had no real idea what lunar samples were like and because everyone has read War of the Worlds, they actually designed it as a quarantine facility.  And so, both the astronauts and the samples went into quarantine for 21 days after Apollo's 11, 12, and 14, to make sure all the bugs from the moon didn't kill all life on Earth.  And now once they got to the surface and they realized there was no water, and really no atmosphere, and they already knew that, they're like, there's no bugs in these samples.  But through an abundance of caution, for the first three missions, they kept the quarantine going.  And so, that was a facility designed to keep everything in, so everything leaked in.  And the problem with that is everything leaks in on the samples, and we're trying to keep the samples clean.  And so, once they realized, no, this isn't -- you know, this isn't a concern, we're not trying to keep the bugs in.  They redesigned laboratories in the building next door -- in Building 31.  And within about three or four years, they moved over and put most of the samples there in a positive pressure laboratory, where everything leaked out and everything leaked away from the samples.   And the samples were stored in glove boxes surrounded by nitrogen and no one ever touched them, no one ever breathed on them, or coughed on them, like me.  And so, yeah.  So, that was -- that was a pretty quick change they had to make.    Host:  Okay.  So, some of the later Apollo missions -- the samples collected from those I guess have some of the more pristine samples that you have here because of this method?    Ryan Zeigler:  Sort of.  I mean there's more of them and so some of them were able to be held in reserve.  But all of them originally came back and were open and then -- and initially analyzed in their lunar -- in the LRL, in the Lunar Receiving Lab.  And then it wasn't till like '73, '74, when all of the samples got moved over to the next -- to the next thing, so yeah.    Host:  So, then the actual study of -- or the actual process of studying, what's that like?  What is -- what do you do to actually figure out what's inside?    Ryan Zeigler:  Wow.  There's so many different studies.  So, I've been the Apollo curator for about six years now and I've had almost 400 individual requests to analyze sample.  So, I'd like to go through them one by one -- no?  Okay.  So, yeah.  Yeah.  No, it could be a long podcast.  You know, if you -- if you look at all of the collections in total, a lot of effort goes into dating the samples.  And you would think, yeah, we already know the date of them.  Well, as instruments and scientists get better -- oh, man -- the way they age date the samples has been refined over time.  And there's a couple different camps still trying to figure out exactly the age of the moon.  A lot of study has been on the new water they found.  But there's even esoteric things.  Like a guy in the UK wanted samples to do spectroscopy to figure out if he could see life on planet -- on exoplanets.  And so, all life on Earth has a chirality, it's all left-handed or right-handed, and I'm not a biologist, so I don't remember.  But if you look at the light that reflects off an atmosphere with that light in it, can have a chirality to it.   And so, they're from orbit and Earth, they're trying to do that.  And one of the main sources of contamination for them is light bouncing off the moon.  So, he needed to see what light bouncing off the moon looked like to put into his equations to understand whether they could see life on exoplanets from their atmospheres -- from spectroscopy of their atmospheres.  And so, every-- I mean everything in between.  It's just crazy how diverse Apollo samples and samples, in general, can be used.    Host:  So, it's fair to say you're still studying them though, right?    Ryan Zeigler:  Oh, absolutely.  This year, I -- you know, we have -- a new batch of requests just came in and we have 36 new requests for the -- to be considered by the committee that reviews all of these and they'll do that next month, so.  I -- they might find out about it on here.  They don't know how many we got, so they might be a little dismayed at how much work they have to do.    Host:  We'll put this out a little bit later, so we don't have any spoilers.    Ryan Zeigler:  No, that's okay.  They wouldn't listen to me anyway.    Host:  Okay, so when you're cracking them open -- and some of the -- some of the first times you were actually -- you -- now you have scientists that have their hands on these lunar samples -- the first time.    Ryan Zeigler:  They better not.    Host:  Well, oh, okay.  They have -- they have protective gloving -- gloves and --    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.    Host:  Proper equipment to analyze the samples for the first time, first time humans have ever done that.  What were some -- was some of the first things that they wanted to look at and some of the first things that they found?    Ryan Zeigler:  So, some of the very first measurements that were done, after the Apollo 11 samples came back, were actually done here.  So, the LRL was both the containment facility and the curation facility, but it also had a certain number of built-in instruments to do some of these initial preliminary examinations.  And one of them was to look at the radiation in the sample.  Now everyone hears radiation and thinks, Chernobyl or -- no, what they're trying to see is the natural radiation that every rock has.  And so, they built a special pit underneath Building 37 that was lined with dunnite, a special type of rock from Earth, battleship armor from pre-nuclear tests.  So, the -- it could drive down the low levels of natural background radiation.  Put the samples in front of a detector and then see just how much radiation was coming off of these.  And so that was one of the very first things done.  They had a gas lab to see what kind of gases came off it, whether there was a, you know, measuring the solar wind.  So, it was -- it was measurements like that that were initially done at Johnson Space Center.  And then almost immediately after those initial measurements were done, they went out to I think 50 or 60 different groups around the country who were pre-approved, and they all had different stuff they were doing.    Host:  Unbelievable.  So, I guess to work with this and to find out something specific, right, if you wanted to find out something more about radiation, there's something special that you have to design, something special that you have to do.  It's not just chiseling at it and looking at it and say, ah, there's the radiation.  There's like this huge -- this very unique type of experiment and facility that you have to design.    Ryan Zeigler:  Right.  And that particular facility was both expensive and time-consuming.  And so, that was the kind of thing that NASA was going to take on, where -- because they could use Apollo money on it.  And then other things that didn't require quite such specialized equipment, that could be done better by the experts in those individual fields at the different universities and other institutions.    Host:  There you go.  Okay, so I'm assuming that one of the main objectives, when you have these samples of moon rocks, is to find out what happened to the moon.  What was the formation of the moon?  So, does some of your findings support Giant Impact Theory?    Ryan Zeigler:  I think, at this point, pretty much all of the findings support Giant Impact.  Now there's still -- yeah.  I mean there's still a little bit of debate about how big the impactor was, or the exact timing, or -- but as far as I know -- and I go to all of these conferences, whether I like it or not, I'm -- and, you know, keep an eye on these guys.  And no, I mean everyone -- no one's arguing about -- at these science conference -- whether there was a Giant Impact.  They're arguing about the details of the Giant Impact.  I know there are one or two holdouts, but that they are being increasingly marginalized, just by the -- by the data that's coming off the samples.    Host:  So, we can pretty much sit down and say, yeah, it was some kind of Giant Impact Theory that formed it.    Ryan Zeigler:  At this point, yes.  I mean, although if you'd asked me 10 years ago if there was any water on the moon, I would have said absolutely not and everyone agrees on that.  And so -- but there's physics involved here and I don't understand physics because I'm a geologists.  But I mean the angular momentum of the Earth-moon system and the spin and all that, that's really hard to do any other way.  And that's not going to change, like we're not going to learn how to measure angular momentum better.  So, I don't think the Giant Impact is going away, yeah.    Ryan Zeigler:  Okay.  Okay.  That's fair.  So, kind of going back to some of the facilities that you have.  I'm imagining -- I'm imagining these guys in gloves and you said, oh, no, they're not going to be touching it.  They're going to be wearing proper equipment and they're going to be using -- you know, they're going to make sure they're not -- nothing's going to get contaminated.  What does that look like?  What is this -- you say, bunny suit?    Ryan Zeigler:  Well, so in our lab, if you want to come and study the samples -- so, yeah, you would put on a full bunny suit.  Think white polyester suit head-to-toe.    Host:  Okay.    Ryan Zeigler:  Basically, a pair of coveralls, cloth gloves, a hat.  Not -- we don't have to wear masks most of the time.  And then over boots.  And then you go into a laboratory that's sterile -- not sterile because they're -- that's very clean.  And then the samples are inside the cabinets.  And then you put your hands through neoprene gloves and then if you needed to handle the samples, themselves, on the inside of the neoprene gloves -- excuse me -- you would put Teflon gloves.  And so, you can only touch the samples with Teflon, or aluminum, or steel.  So, you would have to actually handle the samples in our laboratory through three layers of gloves, inside of a controlled atmosphere cabinet.  Yeah.  And so, now not everyone in their own lab has to do that because we have to keep the samples ready for anyone to do anything, as near as we can.  If somebody knows that they're not going to contaminate the samples by handling them in air, what -- when I did this at Washington University in Saint Louis, before I came here, we had a clean flow bench.  We would take the samples to JSC [inaudible].  We would open them, we would pour them out, then you rinse them off with acetone, you get some of the dust off.  Picked them up with tweezers, never touched them with my hands, despite what the pictures show.   And then we would get them ready and when we send them off to the reactor to do -- to do -- to do measurements and stuff like that.  So, clean space, controlled atmosphere, but not a controlled atmosphere -- sorry.  Not inside of a nitrogen glovebox.  And that's -- most people don't have the glove boxes we have.  They cost a quarter of a million dollars each and there's all this infrastructure that goes into it, so.    Host:  Wow.    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah.  No.    Host:  Take your moon rocks very seriously.    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah, well we spent 24 billion dollars to bring them back, we ought to -- we ought to keep -- you know, okay, we're trying to keep them safe for long term.    Host:  Exactly.  And like you said, you're still studying them and there's still a lot of things to be discovered.  So, the last thing you need is to -- is to waste any of the samples.    Ryan Zeigler:  You don't get to have two bad days in curation.  You have one bad -- you can't un-contaminate a sample.  If something goes wrong and water got on the samples, it's always going to have had water on it and it will eliminate certain number of measurements.  And so, no, we -- yeah, you're right.  We do -- we have procedures -- I mean I used to make fun of procedures before I came to NASA.  Now I really make fun of procedures, but I understand why they're important and why we have them.  And so -- and we have like 160 of them to run the lab and all the different things we have to do to them.  Yeah.    Host:  Wow.    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah.  Auditors love us because we've got everything written down.  It's great.  Yeah.    Host:  Okay.  So, then that brings me to the thought that there's a finite number of -- or finite amount of moon rocks that you have.  So, how do you keep track of it?  How do you make sure that you have -- that you're taking advantage of this finite amount?    Ryan Zeigler:  With great effort.  So, every sample that we loan to a scientist to do study on -- to do a study on, we keep track of.  And everything's a loan and they have to return it.  So, if they destroy it, as part of the analysis, then great, then they have better have had permission to do that.  Then that's great, we mark that off.  But anything else, they would study, and they would come back.  And so, once a year, I send them all an inventory, and they have to check off and they say, yes, I have all these samples or no I don't, in which case bad things happen.  And no one ever says, no, I don't.  They're very, very conscientious.  And so, 125 inventories a year gets sent out and I have to -- you know, we all - we all take care of it.  Now we do in -- an internal inventory with JSC security where once a year -- or once every other year, they come by and they ask us to find every sample for them.  And so -- yeah, no.  And so, we have to meet the same bar as everyone else, just every other year, because we have 100,000 samples and most scientists have 50 or 100, so.    Host:  So, the interesting thing about the moon rocks is that you're still -- you've collected them so long ago but you're still finding stuff out, right?  And so -- so what are the -- some of the more recent findings that you've been having?    Ryan Zeigler:  Well, one of the more recent findings that has come out and in the last five or six years was that perhaps the Solar System didn't form the way we originally thought it did.  People noticed that there was a preponderance of samples on the moon that are 3.9 billion years old.  Now the age, itself, doesn't matter to you or me.  But within the Solar -- and they were all formed by giant impacts.  Now 600 million years after the Solar System formed, there shouldn't be a bunch of giant impacts.  Everything should have quieted down by that.  So, for -- to explain the lunar samples, they had to come up with a new dynamical model for the evolution of the entire Solar System.  So, originally, it was -- the new one was called the Nice Model because it was formed by a bunch of scientists in Nice, France, which I hope is true or I'm going to get phone calls.  And that said that Jupiter, and Saturn, and Uranus, and Neptune all formed in much closer to the Sun.  They gravitationally interacted and then they spread out 3.9 million years ago.  And when they did that, they took all of the asteroids and comments and spun them around the Solar System and that caused the Giant Impacts.  Now people don't like the Nice Model anymore.  Now they have something called the Grand Tack Model, but it doesn't matter.   Any of the models for planetary formation actually have to explain the ages that we see in the Apollo samples.  Now the ages, themselves, are actually old.  They figured that out early on.  But no one noticed how many ages were 3.9 and put two and two together with what it meant for the Solar System, as a whole, until more recently.  And so -- you know.  So, when people ask me what moon rocks can tell you about, I say, well, where Jupiter formed.  And they always look at me like I'm lying.    Host:  Well, it's kind of amazing how we can find so much about our Solar System, just from studying so close to home.  I've had a couple conversations with some -- some of the meteorite sample curators and like --     [ Inaudible ]    Host:  Yeah, I've had conversations with all of them and just the stories that you can find from analyzing these rocks are fantastic.    Ryan Zeigler:  And it's really nice because the meteorites are all really old.  So, almost all the meteorites are older than all the Apollo samples.  And all the Apollo samples are older than the Earth.  And so, each of them gives you a different window into how the Solar System formed.  And if we only had one, we wouldn't know the whole story, or even if we only had two.  Having all three is really important to understanding how things work.    Host:  So, looking towards the future, are there missions that you are kind of planning for for possibly extra curation missions or anything that is going back to the moon to analyze something new?    Ryan Zeigler:  Well, I mean there was just a big announcement yesterday, obviously, that, you know, NASA is refocusing on the moon and I think want to send people back to the moon.  And there was some talk about robotic missions, both to do in situ science, science on the surface, but also to hopefully bring back some samples.  I stayed at Wash U to be part of the Moonrise Team, which was a new frontiers mission, so a billion dollar mission, to bring back samples back from the far side.  We came in second twice to Juneau and OSIRIS-REx, I'm not bitter, especially while I was at the Juneau -- at the -- at the OSIRIS-REx launch.  No.  And then this most recent time, they just down selected Caesar and Dragonfly as the finalists for the next round of New Frontiers, so Moonrise won't go either.  But within those two, Caesar is a sample return mission.  It is a sample return mission from the surface of a comet.  So, there was a Rosetta Mission by Europe and it went and it -- you know, it went into orbit around a comet.  And then sent a lander and then studied that and I don't know that much about it.  And I don't know that much about Caesar yet because it's brand new.  But their plan is to bring back samples from the surface, both gas and ice, and I think rock samples, back from the surface of a comet, to Johnson Space Center, where we will curate them.   So, we're going to have to figure out how to curate gas and ice.    Host:  Oh, yeah.    Ryan Zeigler:  And it's not that we don't have an idea.  We do but we have never had to do it before.  And so, we're going to spend the next -- luckily, we have about 15 years to build up the capabilities to get ready for that.    Host:  Okay, so capabilities in terms of facilities.    Ryan Zeigler:  Right.  So, I mean keeping ice cold is easy.  There's lots of ice labs around the country.  But if you want to treat that ice like we treat rocks, where you're going to subdivide it, and that's different.  If you want to work on it cold, that's harder.  And also, there's cold and then there's cold.  So, minus 20, great, that's easy.  We can do that with a freezer.  Minus 80, oh, that takes robotics and [inaudible] minus 160, like do you really want to keep it like the temperatures on the comet, itself?  And these are things we still don't know all the answers to and we don't even know the requirements yet.  But this is going to be what we spend the next decade figuring out.    Host:  Okay.  All right.  Well, best of luck to you.    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah.  Yeah.    Host:  It's going to be a long process.  Ryan, thank you so much for coming on.  That was -- that was fantastic to learn about everything -- all these moon rocks.  I've been dying to have this conversation.    Ryan Zeigler:  It was my pleasure.    Host:  Fantastic.  And it's crazy what the moon rocks can tell you, just from looking at these and that we're still finding stuff out and just, you know, the story of water that has to -- you have to rethink these thoughts that -- and findings from decades ago because there's something new that we found.  So, it'll be interesting to see what comes up in the future.    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah.  Absolutely.    Host:  All right.  Very cool.  Thanks for coming on.    Ryan Zeigler:  All right.  My pleasure.     [ Music ]    Host:  Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So, today, we talked with Ryan Ziegler about moon rocks and the facilities that are keeping them.  And honestly, we're still hurting so much from these rocks.  If you want to know more about the rocks, you can go to the ARES site, that's our Astromaterials group.  It's ares.jsc.nasa.gov.  You can go to that site also to find out how to get your hands on a meteorite sample if you actually want to study meteorites or moon rocks.  On social media, you can follow the NASA Johnson Space Center accounts or the Astromaterials accounts, they have their own on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.  You can go to any one of those accounts and use the hashtag ask NASA to submit an idea or question for the show or for I guess any other reason.  But if you want it to be brought right here on Houston, we have a podcast, just make sure to mention the show, and then we'll actually bring it on, maybe answer it, or dedicate an entire episode to it.  We have done in the past.  This podcast episode was recorded on February 14, 2018.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, and Tracy Calhoun, and Jenny Knotts.  Thanks again to Dr. Ryan Zeigler for coming on the show.  We'll be back next week.",

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 163, “Next Gen STEM.” I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. This one is for the students and teachers out there that want to get involved with NASA, even getting some experience with NASA before you hit college. NASA has some exciting ways to get involved in America's space agency and get real hands on experience. An, initiative called Next Gen STEM is doing just that. And, there are some incredible challenges to get involved with, where students can contribute to NASA missions directly. On this episode we're bringing in Jamie Semple and Mike McGlone education specialist and coordinator, respectively, based here at the Johnson Space Center to talk about some of the more recent challenges and how you can stay tuned for some upcoming opportunities. Let's get right into it. Of course, after our opening music. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Jamie and Mike thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.  Jamie Semple: Thanks, Gary. It's great to be here.  Mike McGlone: Thanks, Gary. Very glad to be back on again after a couple years ago we did a fun one, looking forward to doing it again.  Host: Yeah. Mike, it's been a while, that’s right. We did Microgravity University, MgUE was the last thing we talked about. This one's a little bit different. It's called Next Gen STEM. There's a lot of really cool challenges coming up in the very near future and some that have already taken place. And, we're going to recall some of the ones that have been, I guess, just recently passed. So, this is very exciting. Some of the opportunities that can be for students. I want to get a little bit of a better understanding of who we're talking to here. Just some of your background so we know who are the people that are actually leading some of these activities that get students to participate in actual real-life NASA missions. Jamie we'll start with you.  Jamie Semple: Sure. So, I actually started my career doing research. I was actually part of the team that did the nutrition science research out of the University of Alabama Birmingham. I originally graduated from Stanford University with a biology degree. And, while I was working in the laboratory. I really was interested in actually moving on to teach and actually coached, coached basketball specifically. So, I went ahead and actually completed my masters in secondary education. And, then from there went on to teach high school and middle school science as well as coached football and basketball. So, I really enjoyed that. And, in 2006, I had the opportunity to come to Houston to join the Space Center Houston Education Team at the Official Visitor's Center for Johnson Space Center. And, I was there for about six years. Really enjoyed working with the team there and the programs. And then I had the opportunity to come to Johnson Space Center and specifically the Office of STEM Engagement, which at that time was actually the Office of Education. So, was there for about six years as well. And, really enjoyed just being part of the NASA family and being able to serve and you know, to provide education programs to people around the nation. I did go ahead and explore some different opportunities in 2017, but I made my way back to Johnson Space Center at the end of 2018. And, I've been working on the NASA App Development Challenge ever since. So, looking forward to sharing some information about that today.  Host: Well, very good. And, so nice to have you back. I'm zooming in here on the part of your career where you were going for a science degree and then somewhere in there you got passionate about teaching others. Was it, was it a moment, some event that you went out and you were teaching, and something just clicked where you're like, “oh wow, this is awesome, I can actually influence other people's careers? This is what I want to do.” Was there some moment that, that made you want to change your career path?  Jamie Semple: I wouldn't say a specific moment. I was always a big fan of NASA and was really interested in what was going on with the agency. I actually grew up west of Houston, Katy, Texas. And, I remember coming to Johnson Space Center as a little kid. So, I always enjoyed the, you know, seeing what's going on and very interested in the space program. I also like working on teams where I can help others be successful. So just as I was thinking about those things and enjoying coaching basketball. And, just wanted to try to, you know, bring all those things together. So, been very lucky, like I said, I was lucky to be able to come over in 2006 and actually join the Space Center Houston team and actually come onboard with Johnson Space Center and the Office of Education. So, it's been, you know, close to I would say 12 years now in space science education. But I really have enjoyed the opportunities to be able to just serve the community and obviously teach as many as people as possible.  Host: Very good. I'm very excited to get into some of those things that we're doing here at NASA. But first, let's go back over to Mike. Mike, a little bit about yourself.  Mike McGlone: Sure, you bet. My background is in STEM education and training. I've been a classroom teacher, teaching mostly high school sciences. I also worked in the nonprofit career for a while doing informal education and training of volunteers. I came to NASA first in 2004, working with a group at the time, Aerospace Education Services Project, which did teacher development programs, teacher education throughout the United States, also did student programs, etcetera. Had to leave for a while. There was the shuttle program, some cutbacks. So, I spent some time then doing online education and developing science curriculum and activities. Then we had everybody come back few years ago and now to the Office of Education now Office of STEM Engagement. And, I've been working on these new student challenges, which is our purpose for today, you know, about getting kids excited about NASA and getting them actually involved in the missions.   Host: Well, let's go right into that Mike. Both of you mentioned starting in the Office of Education. Now it's called NASA Stem Engagement. So, Mike tell me a little bit more about this. What is, what is STEM engagement?  Mike McGlone: You bet. I guess it started about two years ago, but about 18 months ago it became official, we moved to the Office of STEM Engagement. And, what it was, more than just a name change. We really wanted to focus on engaging students. And NASA's mission, I mean, that's actually, kind of our tagline to inspire, engage, educate, and employ. Go out and talk to folks about the STEM pipeline. You know, kids, students out there that are working towards STEM careers, which of course NASA employs hundreds of those and through our contractors, thousands of those. And, we need to keep people moving along that pipeline to get involved. So, what we want to do is focus on those activities that actually engage the students in our mission. From the simplest things of, you know, watching an eclipse or watching a launch and doing some things to, in fact an activity we're going to talk about today where students are actually doing some basic research and designing of materials and software that may actually be used in future missions.  Host: Oh see, that's very significant. It's not just like a random exercise, this is actual, practical research and experience. Someone can lock on to it and then find that there's actual use to some of this. And, if they find it fun and interesting, perhaps dedicate their careers to it. As per that last thing you mentioned, Mike, that was the purpose and the goals of STEM engagement, that last one, being employed, getting more people to go into STEM fields.  Mike McGlone: Yeah. Most definitely, just touched on that. You know, it is one of those things we keep hearing about from Congress, national leaders is we need more folks involved in the STEM fields not only at NASA but across the country. Of course, we're interested in the NASA folks, but yeah, it's definitely something very important to the country.  Host: And, you're talking about a whole range of programs. How do we do this? How do we engage students and get them to this point where they're actually considering or at the very least participating in STEM activities, being science, technology, engineering, math? What's the whole, if you were to take a whole snapshot of STEM engagement and all the activities that's being done within that office, what kinds of things could you expect to do?  Mike McGlone: Oh wow. It's a long, long list, which we don't have time to cover it all today. But I can give you a brief overview. And, I think Jamie will jump in with a few of the, some specifics. But we have programs that are designed everywhere in both the formal and the informal education world. You know, we focus at students that are K through 16, so it's not just your elementary, middle, and high school students. We have, there are programs out there for college students, even graduate level, even some post doctorate things. It includes internships for those students. And, it could be as simple as activities that teachers can use in the classrooms about Artemis, like the SLS or the Orion, to very simple things such as, during a launch, we put together education kits that teach students about like, the recent Commercial Crew launch that we had back in the end of May, first of June. Some of the more in-depth things are such as, the challenges and that Jamie and I are going to talk about just a little bit more here today.  Host: Yeah. Let's go right into that then. Jamie, so the topic of today's discussion is Next Gen STEM. That's one of the many, I guess, activities that fall under the umbrella of STEM Engagement. Tell me a little bit more about this. What's Next Gen STEM?  Jamie Semple: So, Next Gen STEM is actually a project composed of a variety of different items. And, Mike touched on a little bit of those. But, pretty much is an integrated portfolio of everything from activities to educational products, grants, partnerships, and then student engagement opportunities. Primarily focused on the idea that we want to be able to provide an opportunity for K through 12 students to directly contribute to our NASA's project and mission goals. So, that development challenge and the word challenge are actually under that project umbrella. And, within Next Gen STEM, there's quite a few different things. And, Mike talked a little bit about those. But they're really focused in the four key areas, our mission driven focus areas. There is Commercial Crew, Aeronautics, Moon to Mars, and STEM on Station. And Mike and I actually work on the Moon to Mars team. And, within that specific project, there are actually five student challenges. There are educator guides. There are a lot of different resources available in regards to current projects that are going on. Like, Mike talked a little bit about resource kits for upcoming missions. There's actually a Mars 2020 toolkit that is available online. So, there is a wide array, excuse me, there's a wide range of different activities and opportunities for people to get involved with. So, if you look at some of the other focus areas, there's virtual reality fieldtrips, there's a citizen's science guide, and there's videos. There's actually opportunities for professional development through the Educator Professional Development Collaborative. So, there's a lot of different things. But the main goal here is to get, get people excited and spark their interest in STEM. Really focus on showing them that there are ways to be involved in STEM Careers. And, then just giving them that opportunity to contribute to what NASA is doing. So, that's exactly what that development challenge and the WEAR challenge fall in place.  Host: There's so many elements to this, Jamie. It can be a little bit overwhelming just diving into the list that you were going through. I'm trying to think about myself. If I was a, if I was a teacher, if I was a student and I had general interest in participating in some of these. I know a lot of people engage with the Commercial Crew Program, with the Demo-2 mission, Bob, and Doug launching to the station and returning home to Earth. A lot of people engaged in that. But, now there's actually a chance to participate in some of that program. And, you guys are part of the Moon to Mars, so some exploration initiatives. Very, very exciting stuff. But, if I were to look at that, I'd be kind of overwhelmed right off the bat. Oh man, there's so much. There's all these different resources that I can go. Where do I start? Jamie, if you were to, if you were to say this to either, either a teacher or student or someone that was eligible or I guess interested in investigating some of this, where would you tell them to start? To at least get their toes in the water here.  Jamie Semple: Yeah, great question. So, kind of depends on which group you're in. But definitely go to the Next Gen STEM website. And, that will give you an opportunity to obviously see what, they can click on the different mission focus areas and see all the resources that are available. Like you said, there's just a lot of great products out there, great activities and things that people can participate in as well. So, another way to get involved and actually get updates on what's going on, more current updates, is the NASA Express. And, you can actually sign up for that email. And, you'll get updates on what's going on as far as projects, challenges, live events, kind of like what you were talking about with Demo-2 and of course the upcoming Crew-1 mission here in a few months. So, you definitely want to sign up for that, especially if you want to get those, you now, specific up to date opportunities via email and see those as they're coming out. And, then also NASA social media. I know that both Mike and I, for our student challenges, we actually utilize that to get information out about information sessions or in the case of our challenge start date or our kickoff events. So, we definitely utilize that as well. So, there's just a, like you said, there's a lot out there and there's a couple different ways that you can actually find out what's going on in regards to the office of STEM Engagement, in this case Next Gen STEM.  Host: Now Mike, I'm listening to some of these resources that Jamie's pointing out. And, I think what's nice about this is we're in this interesting time where COVID-19 has a lot of us working from home. I know NASA, us specifically at the Johnson Space Center, many of us are at a work from home status. But, seems like a lot of these different resources that you can access are online and available, either if you're going into the office, performing jobs there or school. Or if you're like us and you're stuck at home. There's a lot of these, there's ways to access this information even during COVID-19.  Mike McGlone: Oh, most definitely. If you go to the webpage that Jamie mentioned, at NASA.gov/STEM, it'll take you to our page within NASA that breaks down all the activities. And like you were talking about, what do we have for students? What do we have that will be of interest to educators? And, even for students it breaks it down to their age range. And, a new product that we actually did, as COVID-19 actually, you know, took off back in April, we went through a lot of our activities and pulled them together in a product we call NASA at Home. And, these were activities that, as a group of our educators went through to actually review and said, “hey these are things the kids actually could do at home. They fit in their curriculum. Where does it fit?” Either to help supplement what the teachers are having them do for classes or just something to do for the fun of it. So, and that's all pulled together like you were saying it is a plethora. Trying to keep up with it will drive you a little bit crazy. But there is plenty of stuff there to look at. And, it's broken down, like I said, in a really nice way. You can look at it, you know, by grade. Are you a student? What are you looking for? You know, do you want to be a NASA intern? Do you want to be, are you in kindergarten and looking for something to do or looking at it with your parents? It's just a great site to go and find what you're looking for.  Host: This is perfect. And, I know this can be overwhelming. So, I'm lucky to have both of you on today because you are leading specific challenges that we can dive into now. So, going beyond this cloud of information, all of these different resources that you can access, let's dive into -- these, some of the specific things that can be done through this program through Next Gen STEM. Jamie, I know you're the lead for the App Development Challenge. This one sounds interesting. I know you had some experience with the App Development Challenge before. Tell me a little bit about this.  Jamie Semple: Yes. Very excited to launch year-two of App Development Challenge. All the information that we've talked about today is actually available on our ADC website. And, that's NASA.gov/education/appchallenge. But this is year-two. Our pilot program year, last year, we actually collaborated with the Ascent Abort-2 team, or the AA-2 team to actually have students build an app out of visualized flight data for the flight test that took place in July of 2019. So, it was a great pilot program year for us. We had the opportunity to bring a couple teams down to the, to the flight test at Kennedy Space Center. And, we're actually building off the success of that pilot program year to launch the new challenge, which is actually open for registration right now. And, in just a few days we will actually have our live virtual kickoff event on September 30th. So, this year's challenge, we are collaborating with the NASA Space Communications and Navigation Team. Their acronym is SCaN, so we'll refer to them as NASA SCaN. So, we are partnering with SCaN to have student teams create an app that will visualize the South Pole region of the Moon. So, as everyone talks about the Artemis program and us returning to the Moon, this is a direct tie into exactly where future exploration will be. So, we're very excited that we can offer this to the middle school and high school students throughout the nation. So, we're looking forward to getting the challenge up and running on September 30th.  Host: You know, if I'm a middle school and high school student, I'm trying to remember myself back in the day. And, I'm hearing this, right. I'm hearing, “hey you have an opportunity to come up with this great way to map the polar region and to do all these fancy space things.” I mean, the first thing that comes to mind is I'm immediately, Jamie, I'm immediately overwhelmed. I'm like there's no way that I have the skill set to do this. I mean this sounds pretty cool. But, how can I contribute to something like this? I don't have any experience. I might not be the right person to do this. Tell me about the, you know, the whole challenge and the ways to make it accessible to those that might be interested and take this opportunity to learn how to do it, for those that may want to participate but, at this point, are kind of scared to.  Jamie Semple: That’s a great question and comments regarding the challenge, we have worked very hard to make it more accessible to the students. This is a highly rigorous challenge, you know, seven weeks, it's a very short time frame that you have to create an app. So, teams that are registered to actually build the app, actually have to have a minimum of five students. They also have to have a lead teacher. And, there's more information on the website regarding eligibility and actually, how to register a team to participate. We do, we'll provide a lot of resources along the way to help teams be successful. On September 30th when we have our live kickoff event, we will actually have on our website, the ADC guide. And, that guide will give you all the specifics and details on how to participate in the challenge. And, exactly what we hope to see with your team’s lunar South Pole app. So, in addition to that, we will also provide a lunar data file. That’s the actual data, it’s the position and slope data from the area that we want you to visualize. So, you will actually have both of those components. And, then during our live kickoff event, we'll talk about how to get started in developing your app. So, if you have an interest in coding, computer science, obviously you're going to have to work with some other folks. But, a minimum of five students makes up a team. There is no maximum team size. So, you can have as many folks as you’d like to participate in the first phase of developing your app. And, then along the way, we're also going to provide live virtual connections, where we actually have subject matter experts from NASA, talk through how to develop an app. So, we'll be supporting teams that way throughout the entire challenge.  Host: See, that's a great way to kickoff. If you have a basic interest in space and you have a basic interest in coding and software, which I know is a very big field and with a lot of opportunities. This sounds like an amazing opportunity. I wanted to zoom in, though, on this Ascent Abort-2 App Development Challenge that you had. This is something you already did. You have a, you have a case where you tried something new and you saw it through to the end with results. Can you tell me more about that challenge? How the students engaged with the Ascent Abort-2 and some of the things you saw at the end of this whole process?  Jamie Semple: Sure. Yeah. So that was our pilot program year. So, we were trying to obviously figure out how to navigate a new challenge and provide it to students at the same time. So, it was very interesting. But we do have a technical advisor from the Ascent Abort-2 team. We have to do this same thing with this year's challenge. We actually have a technical advisor from the SCaN team. And, last year, with the Ascent Abort-2 challenge, we were able to provide resources and best practices along, I think it was a seven-week time frame for teams to develop the app. So, we had a great response, a lot more teams involved in the challenge than we thought. And, honestly, we received some great videos of the team’s apps and then honestly, we were just thoroughly impressed with the work that they did. Making this a team-based challenge is something that very closely mimics what NASA teams do throughout their work as they seek to collaborate, to successfully complete a project. So, having that same dynamic will help them understand the challenges and how you overcome those as you're actually, in this case, building an app. But, it's tremendously successful. We did take two teams to the flight test in July of 2019. And, they were actually able to see the flight test live, see the launch. They got access to the mission control room where they got a chance to talk to some folks that were working on the mission. And then, we were actually able to use some of the data from the flight test, some altered data from the flight test and actually run it on the students' apps. And, it was great to see because the flight test ended up actually exceeding, I think the height for the test, the launch itself for the elevation of that, that AA-2 actually went to. So, we were actually able to see that on the students' apps. So, it was really cool. They did an excellent job. And, like I said, we've used that model and expanded on it a little bit to offer this year's challenge.  Host: What a cool thing. Not only do you get to actually participate in some of this stuff. But I bet you that you had a bunch of eyes lighting up just walking around mission control and actually seeing the Ascent Abort-2 mission, seeing a rocket go off the pad. That must have been such an incredible experience. There was something, I know, I have here called the Culminating Event. Was that, was that it when they actually went to go see it or am I thinking about something else here?  Jamie Semple: No. You got it. That's exactly it. The Culminating Event was five days. And, the students went on VIP tours. They got to present to NASA leaderships. And, we really just had a great time getting them immersed in the NASA culture. They also had the opportunity to present to the general public. So, after the flight test, there's a time for community engagement and outreach. And, they were able to talk to people of all ages and share some of their experiences. This year we're looking to do the same thing. Like I said, the challenge starts on September 30th, it'll actually wrap up on November 18th, with student team video submissions. So, the teams actually don't submit their apps. They actually show a similar video and they post it to YouTube for our teams to review. And, we just obviously, are looking at the video and going through the app requirements. And, then based off of review of those videos, we'll down select interviews. That's where a smaller group of selected teams, we'll actually interview with the SCaN and ADC teams. So, that's a chance to actually talk to the people working for SCaN and learn a little bit more about the team and the app that they've created. After that, we will down select again. We might take one, we might take two or more teams. But those will be our top teams for our Culminating Event. Right now, we're looking at February 2021 for our Culminating Event, that hopefully, will be at a NASA Field Center. But, if not, if we have to do some sort of virtual student symposium, we will definitely do that. But we definitely want to highlight obviously, the students and their work, and that Culminating Event does that.  Host: Now this, yeah, we're still, some uncertainty here with COVID-19. But I'm sure, you know, if we have the COVID, if we have the Culminating, or sorry, the kickoff event, my apologies, coming up here in just a few days, September 30th. I'm assuming, you know, you're going to have students from, is it all over the United States? And, then would they be paired in teams across the United States, so all this work will be done virtually, I guess, for the Fall period of 2020?  Jamie Semple: Yeah. So, teams can be from the same school, different schools. We really have opened it up to formal and informal U.S. educational organizations. So, that really means across the nation, but could potentially mean internationally, if it's like a military base overseas, a school that wants to participate. Science centers can participate. So, you can actually form a team with students from different schools. And, the team is registered by a lead teacher. It has to be a certified and practicing K through 12 educator. But, once the teams are formed, then they can go ahead and obviously start working on developing their app. It's going to be interesting to see how they do that. This challenge is very well set up to be a virtual challenge. They can post their apps online, obviously, and share those from different resources. Most of the software that they're going to use will be online. We don't require them to have a specific operating system or use specific coding language. They determine all that. So, they can find out who has strengths in different areas, and they'd formulate their team that way. So, it's really an open ended and, in regards to what we require. But the main focus here is it's all a student led challenge. And, as students begin to navigate how to build that app, we'll provide those resources and suggestions and different presentations during those live virtual connections. So, we're looking forward to see, you know, obviously how this second year of the challenge goes. We're very excited it ties directly into Artemis. And, more specifically, these students are going to contribute to future mission planning. So that, these apps could actually help the SCaN team train new staff members on, you know, what's the best route for exploration on the Moon. But the main thing is when our astronauts get to the South Pole of the Moon, they need to be safe, they need to be able to communicate with Earth. And, this app brings all those things into play. They will visualize the Moon South Pole region. But they also have to do two additional things. They actually have to plot a path for explorations. So, the astronauts are not always going to land in the place that they're going to explore. So, there's a landing site and we have a destination site. And, they have to plot that path for exploration. And, then the last thing they have to do is they have, actually have to identify ten communication link checkpoints, so places that we can maintain that communication with Earth. So, a very exciting challenge. We're looking forward to getting things rolling on September 30th.  Host: Maps, adventures, communication, what a cool way to participate in returning humans to the Moon. Very, very cool. We'll make sure to put this information about the kickoff event at the very top. For those who are listening and thinking “oh man this is really cool,” we'll have some links and some information in our show notes here where you can go and explore these. So that's just one example of the many things going on in STEM Engagement. This is the App Development Challenge. Mike, I know you're the lead for something called NASA WEAR, the NASA WEAR Challenge. Can you, can you talk a little bit more about that?  Mike McGlone: Yeah. I'd love to. NASA WEAR and believe it or not, that's not an acronym, even though the word NASA is, this one is not an acronym.  Host: Gasp. [Laughter]  Mike McGlone: But we have a challenge very similar in set up to the App Development Challenge that Jamie just talked about. But we have a totally different focus in what we're working on. When our astronauts go into deep space, and we define deep space as anything, really beyond low-Earth orbit, which is where the International Space Station is at. As you go beyond, as you go beyond that low-Earth orbit, you leave Earth's atmosphere, you get beyond or into the much weaker parts of Earth's, magnetosphere. So, we don't get protection from radiation, especially the radiation that's coming from our, from the sun, what we call solar particle events. It's constantly coming, but there's also these larger, makes the explosions, radiation from the sun. You know, you hear about solar flares or coronal mass ejections. That's what one of the outcomes of that is, a lot more radiation from space. And, the human body is very much susceptible to that. And, it's, and it's not good. So that's one of the key hazards that astronauts face going on deep missions back to the Moon or on to Mars. And, in spacecraft design, you know, they did their best to harden the spacecraft to protect the astronauts. But, these larger events, they need more protection. So, we partnered with a group here at Johnson Space Center, the RadWorks Team, who also has team members at Glenn Research Center, in Cleveland, Ohio and Langley Research Center, in Hampton, Virginia, that look at wearable technology that the astronauts could dawn during these large events to provide more protection. Then that's where we got the name NASA WEAR. So, what we were asking students to do, and again, we're focused on middle and high school teams. So basically, grades 5 through 12, is asking them to design garments and or headgear that the astronauts could put on inside their spacecraft, to give them added protection. And, of course to do that, they have to understand what kind of materials are good for protecting against radiation. You know, while it might be nice to have a lead suit, you really can't put that on a spacecraft. It weighs too much. So, what are some lightweight materials that protect you well. They have to, you know, learn about some material science, you have to learn about radiation. And, then they have to get into design process to what would be the best design to protect the human body? And, we're looking at the upper torso, basically the blood forming organs in the upper torso and the head, that's where the headgear comes in with the brain and especially the eyes. So, that's what we challenge students to do. We give them several weeks to learn about that. We work with our RadWorks partners that are at Langley that are a group of material scientists and space scientists there, space physicists that we share with the students. You know, what they're working against in terms of the radiation, talk about human factors. You know, you may put this thing on, but you still got to fly that spacecraft, you still got to do all the things that you got to do to remain safe, keep everything operational. So, you got to be able to move. You got to be able to do all those kinds of things, you know, we talk about protecting the eyes. But you still got to have vision to look at the dials, so to find switches, find things in the spacecraft. So, finding the best materials and how to put that together. And, then we allow them to submit their design process. We select those, ask them to build a low fidelity prototype, low fidelity in that we know they're not going to have all the materials available, you know, in that middle school or high school or even find at home that would be the real thing that we'd use on a mission. But they get to use a good facsimile of the material to design what their prototype will look like. And, then we put it in front of that team from RadWorks and other NASA scientists and engineers and we have them actually present their findings. You know, this is what our, this is why we did this design, this is how it works. And the folks at RadWorks have actually taken some of those design ideas and put them into some of the new prototypes that they're working on. So, the students, in our first go around is, we're in our second year now, but our first go around actually, some of the ideas, like I said, the team has used. They did 3D printing, they did, they used water, these, all sorts of things that the team had not thought of or even some things they had thought of but hadn't had time to investigate. They love the ideas that the students came up with. So, that's the gist of what we're working on is wearable technologies.  Host: Yeah. Like, very fancy space fashion, almost, wearing, you know, headgear and I'm thinking like plated armor. But, I'm sure, I'm sure the students came up with some really, really unique ideas there.  Mike McGlone: They really did. The first year we really focused on just the garment. And, we had students that did biomimicry, they used ideas from nature to come up with one. We had one that did a, the name has skipped me, but basically, it's an African aardvark that's got these, like you said, plates, almost look like armor, they mimicked that. We had those that used ancient, I mean like medieval armor ideas, chain mail, but they did printing 3D using polyethylene, you know, plastic that were interchangeable to actually provide that kind of protection that we're looking for. So, they really came up with some great ideas. And, we did it again this year, the activity and this is the year that we added the headgear. And, I'm looking forward to seeing what they do. Because we're still in the middle of wrapping it up for this year. We just earlier, just selected our final teams for our Culminating Event.  Host: Oh wow, that's a big deal. Yeah, you're going to see some really cool ideas hopefully there. That's amazing. Another example of coming up with unique, unique ways of solving these challenges. I love the 3D printed chain mail idea. That's so cool, instead of shipping something up, you just print it one piece at a time and maybe come up with something, something that can help you out. Very, very cool.  Mike McGlone: Yeah. That was actually something that hadn't been discussed. You know, they had limits on what they could, how much weight of course, that they could use. They gave them a 50-pound maximum for the, for what they could send up. But yeah, the 3D printing, that was one of the first things that the RadWorks folks said is, “hey this is, it's fixable.” You know, either you could print new, new scales if you need them or, it's there because we do have 3D printing capabilities in space. So at least we have hopefully when we go on future missions. So yeah there's so many things that go into this. And, the human factors, it's amazing to me. This is, in a way kind of a set crowd sourcing, using the design process, using students as the idea generators. And, it's really the amazing, different ways that they think and all the different ways that they come up with to address a problem. It's really amazing to watch.  Host: Very cool. And, you say this Culminating Event is coming up very soon. And, I'm assuming that's virtual Culminating Event. What are we, what are we looking at doing for some of the winners here?  Mike McGlone: Yeah. Most definitely. Yeah. COVID definitely had an impact on us. We were originally going to do some of what you heard the App Development Challenge did and we were able to do our first year, which was to take our top teams and have them present live at Langley Research Center to the team, the RadWorks team that works there. Unfortunately, this year, circumstances are not allowing that. So, we are going to a virtual, what we're calling a virtual student symposium, where they're still going to get to hear from NASA experts. And those are what I consider the most important part, their opportunity to present their ideas and findings to our panel of NASA experts and get that review and questions asked and really get that feedback from the experts about their designs.  Host: Very, very cool. You know, I think one of the things that really jumps out to me listening to some of these challenges is, well, the first thing that comes to mind is. Man, where were these things when I was in school? And, maybe it was just my own failure of just not looking in the right places. But, there's so many, so many different opportunities for people to participate in real space challenges and maybe get more exposure to science and engineering than they would in the typical classroom. I think one of the best things about the education field, something you guys both get to participate in, is working with students, you've got to find, have some memories of times where these students are going through these challenges and there's just something in their face, there's something in the way they say something that you can tell that this activity or process has changed them in a way that maybe they weren't considering a STEM field before, but they sure as heck are now. Jamie, I'm sure you have something that comes to mind that, just a memory of a student or maybe just an event where you saw a measurable change in someone's behavior and possibly their career path.  Jamie Semple: Yes certainly, yeah. For the Ascent Abort-2 App Challenge, we had the opportunity to actually set up before the flight test launch at one of the viewing areas. And, so the student teams actually brought their laptops, set them up. So, as everyone from NASA was coming in, these people that had worked on the projects, you know, for months and years. They're coming in, they're actually getting a chance to see, you know, what’s about to happen with the flight test. And, it was just a great opportunity for us to sit back and watch students realize that these are some of the people or the careers that they want to be a part of as they, as they go throughout, you know, their continuing education and obviously and choosing their career. So just watching the engagement and how impressed the folks were that were actually talking to students and just seeing the students light up in terms of, you know, this is, this is what they're interested in doing. And, these people are doing the exact same thing. So, that was just an awesome opportunity for both the students, and it is for us to see kind of everything come to a fruition when it comes to, you know, how we design these challenges, and the impact that we hope they have.  Host: Very cool. Now Mike, what are some of the things that we can look forward to? I'm sure, you know, we're going to keep this episode up here for a while. And, we have these challenges coming up in the very near future. So, we hope people tune in and get a chance to participate in some of those, in the near term. But Mike, some of those things coming up, coming up in the future that maybe, if they don't, if they miss this opportunity, they'll have some more, sometime down the road.  Mike McGlone: Yeah. Thank you for the question about what's coming up next. First off, NASA WEAR, we're getting ready to put together a new iteration of it for the 2020-2021 school year. So, you'll be hearing more about that soon. Keep an eye, Jamie mentioned earlier the NASA Express, which is a weekly newsletter about opportunities. So, look for that specifically. But other things that are coming up, there are lots of them. Like we mentioned earlier, there are lots of different things that are coming out. There's a new opportunity for undergraduates at the university level called SPOCS [Student Payload Opportunity with Citizen Science] that actually put experiments on the International Space Station. There are, there'll be new career opportunities around the upcoming crew launch in October. There are all sorts of things. And, even in the future there are things that are planned. Can't say too much about them yet. But always looking for those opportunities to connect to a mission and bring that excitement to the students. And, as mentioned, the best way to keep up with that is check our NASA STEM website quite often and or sign up for that NASA Express Newsletter, which will give you a weekly update of what's out there.  Host: There you go. Have the opportunities come right, right to you. Perfect. Jamie and Mike, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today. What exciting challenges that we have coming up here in the near future. A lot of ways that people can engage in STEM activities even from home, depending on where you are. All these opportunities are available to people and there's a lot more coming up. We've listed a ton of resources here. So, if you didn't catch them all or you don't have a pen and paper next to you to write them all down, don't worry, we'll have all these links and notes in our, in our episode show notes. So, that's for our listeners. Jamie and Mike, thanks again for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast.  Jamie Semple: Thank you so much, Gary.  Mike McGlone: Thanks, Gary.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. Really hope you enjoyed this conversation with Jamie and Mike. For the students and teachers, I hope you listened to the whole thing.

        description: "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 125, \"Deep Space Healthcare.\" I'm Pat Ryan. On this podcast, we talk with scientists, engineers, astronauts, and other folks about their part in America's Space Exploration Program, and today, that includes doctors. Because this is the next part in our series about how NASA is preparing to safely send human beings on future missions to space, from missions to the International Space Station, to the Moon, and eventually to Mars. NASA's Human Research Program is working to learn how the human body is affected by being in the spaceflight environment, so we can figure out how to keep the bad things from happening and be prepared to fight back against those effects if and when they do happen. The HRP has divided that work up into five elements, and we're learning about them in our current series of podcasts that started with Episode 123, \"Humans in Space.\" Today, we focus on developing the plans to take care of those future astronauts. As HRP says on its own website, \"Identifying and testing next-generation medical care and crew health maintenance technologies.\" We have two guests. Nancy Fleming is Element Manager for Exploration Medical Capability, which you'll hear us refer to as ExMC. She began her career at NASA as an avionics and systems instructor for International Space Station and space shuttle astronauts, and for flight control team members, and she's worked in program management, and in mission operations. And Dr. Kris Lehnhardt is the ExMC Element Scientist. Lehnhardt is board certified in emergency medicine in the United States and Canada. You'll find out why. He also works in clinical shifts in the emergency department at Houston's Ben Taub Hospital. That's a top trauma center in our city. He has appointments as a senior faculty with the Baylor College of Medicine in the Center for Space Medicine, and in their Department of Emergency Medicine. So, here's part three of six on NASA's Human Research Program, Exploration Medical Capability. Here we go.  [ Music ]  Host: If you ask any astronaut, or engineer, or scientist, or flight controller around NASA, they will all agree that spaceflight is hard. And you add humans to the mix, and it makes it even harder. For example, we put any numbers of robots on Mars. They've got scientific instruments, and cameras, transmitting devices, so we here on Earth can see what they're doing. But so far, zero people. When you add people to the equation, it becomes very much more complicated, because protecting people from the environment outside the protection of Earth's atmosphere is really hard. It's much harder than fortifying robots for work in outer space. Well, NASA has been working on this human problem since the very beginning of human spaceflight. The Human Research Program coordinates a wide range of studies, and experiments, and projects. They group it into five elements, including one called Exploration Medical Capability. And if you've been listening to the podcast, you're hearing about all of the others in great detail, too. But for today, Nancy Fleming, the element manager for Exploration Medical Capability -- I'll start by asking you, so that we're properly focused here. What is the work of your element, ExMC?  Nancy Fleming: Thanks. I'm happy to be here, and happy to tell you about the work of ExMC. I'm here with our element scientist, Dr. Kris Lehnhardt, and the work of our element -- we work hand-in-hand together to solve the problems associated with long-duration spaceflight to Mars, and how we will address if an astronaut gets injured or sick during that time frame, and the best way to address that.  Host: What is an element manager at this element do?  Nancy Fleming: As an element manager-- I'm part of the leadership team. I work in concert with Dr. Lehnhardt, and together, we set the technical direction of the work of the element. And as a manager, I manage the resources. I make sure that we get the people that we need to do the work, the scientists, the engineers, the physicians, the clinicians in order to accomplish that work. I manage the budgets. We do a lot of communication together. We, together, steer the ship of the work, and ensure that the taxpayers are getting the best bang for their buck.  Host: What was your career that led you to this? Because I think you've been at NASA for some time in other kinds of jobs, right?   Nancy Fleming: I have. My career to NASA is kind of circuitous. It's not kind of circuitous. It's really circuitous, and when I was young, my dad was an electronics technician. And I had this propensity for solving problems, and he recognized that in me. And when I was in sixth grade -- so I think that's -- you're about 12 in sixth grade. My dad sat me down one afternoon, because I was kind of a curious kid, too, and he taught me what hexadecimal was.  Host: Why were you being punished? [laughter]  Nancy Fleming: I thought -- I found it absolutely fascinating.  Host: Really? OK.  Nancy Fleming: What I was excited about was, I had no idea that math and numbers could be manipulated in a creative way that could then be used to solve complex problems. And thus, started my curiosity down that path, and wanting to learn more about math. And I think when I was about 14, I decided I wanted to be a mathematician when I grew up.  Host: Oh, nice.  Nancy Fleming: And as life takes different routes, it did for me, but eventually, I got back to college, and I became a mathematician. And that gave me -- what was exciting about that is, again, solving problems in a creative way, and using a variety of techniques -- mathematical techniques, and things that you don't really normally think of, because they're happening behind the scenes in machines. And that gave me a step -- a foot in the door to be introduced to the work that NASA is doing. So, I moved to Clear Lake, and as you know, Johnson Space Center is in Clear Lake, in Houston, Texas. And I had a professor who was solving problems here for NASA, and he said, \"Hey, do you want to solve some problems with me?\" I said, \"Absolutely. Let me go do that.\" And while I did that, I met folks at NASA, and then I was hired in. And my first job here at NASA, 20 years ago, was training the first International Space Station crews.  Host: Nice.  Nancy Fleming: So, the very first crews for the ISS -- I trained them on the computer systems, and the environmental control and life support systems, and the communication systems.  Host: Nice.  Nancy Fleming: 20 years later, I am now a manager that works with an amazing team of very talented and gifted scientists, physicians, engineers that are working to solve problems in creative ways.  Host: I remember doing an interview with Bill Shepherd, who was the Expedition One Commander, who was fascinated by the fact that, unlike other spaceships or ships that he'd been on before, the International Space Station all was on computers. He was -- told me, \"There isn't a light switch to turn things on and off. It's all on the computers.\" And you --  Nancy Fleming: I trained him on those computers.  Host: -- were teaching on the computers.  Nancy Fleming: Absolutely.  Host: Nice.  Nancy Fleming: We -- I spent a lot of quality time with Shep.  Host: Kris Lehnhardt, what does an element scientist do for ExMC?  Kris Lehnhardt: The job of the element scientist is, as Nancy said, to be part of a team, a leadership team that -- I try to describe to people -- we're sort of the conductors of the orchestra, if you will. So, if the orchestra are all of our clinicians, and physicians, and scientists, and engineers who are helping to design medical systems to go to Mars, we provide them with guidance and direction for what they're going to do. And a lot of our work -- a lot of my work is focused on really trying to dig deep into the problem of providing medical care for space exploration and developing concepts or solutions for that problem. And then our team goes off and actually develops and builds those solutions.  Host: As Nancy mentioned, you're a doctor, but give me the thumbnail of your background.  Kris Lehnhardt: So, mine is equally circuitous to Nancy's.  Host: You guys that competitive, that you're arguing about [laughter] who took the longest route to get here?  Nancy Fleming: We are not competitive. You will find that we are very much a team. We are very much a -- and we have other people that are part of our team as well, our leadership team.  Host: You're -- go ahead, Kris.  Kris Lehnhardt: So, if my accent hasn't given me away yet, I'm originally from Canada, and I grew up as a space nerd. But I also had an intense love of biology. It was in high school that someone encouraged me to think about going into medicine, and I saw that there were astronauts who had been physicians previously. And in fact, there was a Canadian astronaut who was an emergency physician.  Host: Dave Williams.  Kris Lehnhardt: Dave Williams, exactly right. And so, I said, \"Well, maybe I'll go be an emergency physician, and then I can be involved in space.\" And so, that was my initial path, and what I learned as I was doing that was that there was this entire field in medicine called aerospace medicine that I knew nothing about. But what it was, essentially, was the study of medicine in extreme environments, and there's no more extreme environment than space. But there's a lot to learn from all these other environments, as well. So, I studied about wilderness medicine, and diving medicine, and flight medicine, and space medicine, and all of that was focused on how do you provide medical care to people in these terribly difficult places where they don't have any of the stuff that they would otherwise want to have with them? And that path is what brought me to NASA.  Host: You went to some of those extreme environments on your own, didn't you?  Kris Lehnhardt: I do enjoy taking some smart risks, if you will. So, I learned to fly planes. I'm a reservist in the military in Canada, in the Royal Canadian Air Force, as a medical specialist, and I learned to be a scuba diver as well. And so, what I realized as I was training and learning about how to provide medical care in these environments is that I had to actually understand the environments. And these environments, like spaceflight, are what we refer to as operational environments. And so, if you don't understand the challenges of being in those places, it's very hard to think about the problems of providing care in those. As a doctor, most doctors think about hospitals, and large teams of people, and lots of equipment.  Host: Right.  Kris Lehnhardt: And these environments preclude all of that.  Host: There's something you said there a moment ago that struck me. You're talking about how to provide care to people who are in these environments, but not necessarily because that environment impacted them, but it sounds like because they're in a hard place for you, the physician, to get to.  Kris Lehnhardt: Yes, to both. The environment itself, frankly, is trying to kill you, so that is part of the problem. Another part of the problem is that even the healthiest and most fit people in these extreme environments -- we're all still human, and the human system inevitably breaks down. Like your car, various components break down over time. So, treating the human system in that environment is challenging, but changing the mindset of the physician or the clinician who's providing care to people in these environments is essential as well. Because if they are reliant upon their equipment, and their facilities, and their ability to consult with other people, once you take all of that away, can they still do their job?  Host: What can they do? In getting ready to talk with you today, what seemed to filter out to me, as I was thinking about it, was that what you're trying to develop now for future spaceflight is the hospital, or the clinic, or the sick bay capability for taking care of crews on future missions who are farther away, much farther away even than they are on the International Space Station right now. Is that a good analogy, or a valid one?  Nancy Fleming: The sick bay is a great analogy. As you know if you're a Star Trek fan, there's a sick bay in Star Trek, and as you also know if you're a space fan at all, you know that spacecraft are incredibly small. And so, the problem to solve about creating a sick bay for a spacecraft is just how do you get all the things that you need in that to be small and efficient, and we are working towards that.  Host: Yeah, you don't have -- you don't have a warehouse.  Nancy Fleming: We don't have a warehouse, no, and things need to be integrated, and they need to be multi-functional -- that they have the ability to be used for the highest probability of illness or injury that we're anticipating.  Host: And I wanted to -- to touch on this later, but I think what we're -- we want to realize -- and I learned this only just recently -- is that as you're trying to put this all together, you don't have unlimited resources. And you can't supply everything that might possibly be needed, because that spaceship is small, and there's no room for it.  Nancy Fleming: That is very correct.  Host: And the fact is, in the cases of going to the Moon, or going to Mars, they're going so far away that you can't even send it to them.  Nancy Fleming: That is true. You can't send things, and you can't -- you have no resupply, which is sending supplies up. And you can't send things back for analysis, or care.  Host: At least not in a timely fashion.  Nancy Fleming: Right, not in a timely fashion. So, the way that we work for -- with the ISS right now, and even for the Moon, because they are so much closer to the Earth than heading to Mars and Mars is, we have those luxuries of return and supply, and constant communication. And as you get further from the Earth, when you're headed out towards Mars, you lose those luxuries.  Host: As you're working with some of those concepts in mind, you're also working with the other people in the Human Research Program who are working on other focused areas. Give me a sense of how your element works in coordination with the others to tackle this whole big problem of taking care of human bodies outside this safety umbrella.  Kris Lehnhardt: We have to work really closely with the other elements of the Human Research Program, because as you just said, our resources that we're going to have for these missions are extremely limited. And what we're going to have to do is, we're going to have to make tough decisions about what we can actually take with us. And so, as a result, if we each -- if each group does their own individual research, and comes up with their own solution, but we don't look at how that -- all those different solutions combine together into an integrated system, then we're going to end up with a bunch of disparate stuff. And the ultimate goal of the Human Research Program is to help NASA to provide a crew that is both physically and mentally fit to accomplish the mission. And the way that we do that is by developing a crew health and performance system for Mars that integrates all of the work of HRP, to make sure that we can keep them safe and healthy while we do the mission.  Host: It has struck me in talking and hearing you -- some of your colleagues talk, too, that overall, HRP is looking at finding ways to keep people well and safe in this environment, and your element is looking at how to take care of them when they get sick or injured anyway.  Nancy Fleming: That is true. We always like to tell folks, \"We're the tail end of the dog.\" We'd like -- prevention is the best cure, but we're also realists. And we know that people aren't healthy 100 percent of the time, regardless of how well you take care of yourself. Even here on Earth, you may be the epitome of taking care of yourself in all of the right ways, but eventually, your body is a machine, and it's going to break down at some point. And we know that that will be the case in space, and so, we must plan for those contingencies.  Host: Let me get you to help educate us a bit about space medicine, or -- and taking care of people in space. I have heard -- and in the past year, while we've been hearing about anniversaries of Apollo missions, there have been references to things that are even older than that. And back in -- before Mercury flew, it's like doctors were concerned that if they sent people to space, they weren't going to even be able to swallow, because of -- because of the lack of gravity or such. Give me a sense of how space medicine has evolved from those days, through Mercury up to where we are right now, and the ways that we are now able to care for people that we send to space.  Kris Lehnhardt: The space medicine, in the beginning, as you described, was really about how does the human body even work in space? And if it does work in space, can we try and anticipate what types of events are going to occur, and then treat them? And so, from the beginning of space medicine, that's what people have been studying. When we started out with Mercury, they had a very small kit of stuff that they took with them. In fact, I think it fit in a pouch, or a pocket on their leg, and it was like the kind of thing you would take if you were going hiking for a day. And it was really about managing immediate problems, and taking these very healthy people, and giving them some very simple solutions for if they had any ailments that would impact the mission.  Host: And on a very short mission. They weren't expected to be gone for very long.  Kris Lehnhardt: Yes, absolutely. The short mission duration for all of Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo meant that the medical kit was relatively small and didn't have a lot of capability. As we evolved from there to the space shuttle, and then to the ISS, we started developing more robust capabilities for taking care of people. So, for example, on ISS, right now, there's an ultrasound machine that allows us to diagnose medical problems in spaceflight. That ultrasound machine in the future -- our vision of medical care when we go to Mars, and the transition from current-day ISS operations to the future, is this integrated system, where we have all of these amazing capabilities -- laboratory analysis for blood and urine, imaging analysis for ultrasound, all of the medications we're going to need, all of the equipment we're going to need. We're going to have that all as an integrated system, and we're going to try and move past the days of the medical kit, the kind of thing that you take when you go hiking, or you go on a camping trip, to something that's going to be taking care of people for years at a time.  Host: The Swiss Army knife of medical care?  Kris Lehnhardt: That'd be a nice -- it'd be nice to have one of those. I'm sure that we would find some uses for that, but it would be very important for us to know how that piece of equipment worked with all of the other equipment as well.  Host: As we said, in early days of human spaceflight, people were not gone for very long, and they weren’t leaving their spacecraft. And the -- I think that, realistically, the chances that they become injured were probably pretty small, but doctors were concerned that they didn't know how the people were going to be able to even function in that environment, right?  Nancy Fleming: That's what 50 years have brought to us. The human body is -- in space has been studied over that time, and we've learned a lot. In fact, over just the last 20 years, with continuous presence in the ISS, you've had people in space for 20 years, and we've been collecting data on those bodies for 20 years. And we are using that data in ways to inform how we design the next system.  Host: You doctors, and engineers love you data, I know [laughter]. So, you've --  Nancy Fleming: Scientists, too. [Laughter]  Host: -- been -- you've been -- but you've been keeping track of all 200 and -- I think it's 39 right now -- different human beings who have been onboard the International Space Station in 19-plus years. I take it that's been useful? [Laughter]  Kris Lehnhardt: We are putting that data to very good use. That information is going to help us to try and predict the kind of medical events that are going to occur on the way to Mars, and it's through that prediction -- we do a risk analysis, and we essentially come up with lists of conditions, and the most likely conditions. And that helps us to scope a medical system. We would love to take a hospital emergency room on the way to Mars, but that is simply not feasible. And so, what we have to do is, we have to use the data to help us to make evidence-based decisions for what we are going to take to go to Mars. Because the worst-case scenario is that you take stuff that you don't end up using, because that means that that stuff took up space that could've been used for something else.  Host: Else that was needed.  Kris Lehnhardt: Exactly. And so, the -- at the end of the day, this is actually a -- believe it or not, this is an economics problem, which is called the backpack problem.  Host: OK.  Kris Lehnhardt: And it's based all upon maximizing benefit and minimizing risk, or cost. And so --  Host: Which sounds thoroughly reasonable, yeah.  Kris Lehnhardt: -- right. How can we get the best stuff that takes up the least amount of space, that gives you the most bang for your buck.  Host: On the -- studying the astronauts on the space station, you're familiar with the data, and I'm not. Can you give me some sense of things that you've learned after 19-plus years of people in space? What do we know now that we didn't know then?  Nancy Fleming: Well, something that we know now, but we kind of knew before then, was the human body is really just a bag of water with some bones in it. [laughter] And that becomes more apparent when you're in space. [laughter]  Host: Yeah. In -- whoops -- in the -- in what sense?  Nancy Fleming: And what that means is, is in space -- while on the ground, everything your body -- how your body works is used to the gravity pulling it down towards your feet, and so all of your fluid functions get pulled towards your feet. And your body knows how to counteract that with gravity. When you're in a zero-gravity environment, it all equalizes out, no different than when you're diving. You know how you equalize, or you get into a neutral position? That's what happens to your body in space. It becomes a sack of water, and all of those fluids just float. They don't -- they aren't pulled anywhere, and so, your systems have to work differently to push and pull them. You get more fluid in your head, and you're not used to that fluid in your head on the ground, because it all goes towards your feet. And so, that fluid in your head can have different effects on your vision, or depending on how that is, it could have an effect on the way that you're thinking about problem-solving.  Host: It effects your thought processes, too? Is that what you're saying?  Kris Lehnhardt: So, the spaceflight environment -- the lack of gravity, the radiation associated with it, the isolation and confinement on the space station -- all of that affects the performance of the people onboard and has the ability to affect their thinking as well. And so, when we talk about health, we often talk about medicine, but in this case, the health and performance of the crew is as equally -- is equally important.  Host: You take what you've learned from this data, studying these astronauts over this time -- have you had an opportunity -- or, not you personally, but NASA had the opportunity, then, to try to use these astronauts on the space station as -- to test out ways to counteract those things?  Kris Lehnhardt: The space station is the perfect environment that we have -- the best available environment that we have right now to study how humans are going to explore the rest of space.  Host: And I make -- I'm going to stop you there, but first, how do we compare the microgravity environment on the space station to the environment that crews on the way to Mars would experience? Are they very comparable, or very different from one another?  Kris Lehnhardt: They are more similar than they are different.  Host: OK.  Kris Lehnhardt: And so, the spaceflight environment --  Host: On the station -- even better for studying.  Kris Lehnhardt: -- on the station is a great analogue for studying what we need to learn to go to Mars, absolutely right. So, the microgravity that you experience on the space station is essentially identical to the micro-gravity that you're going to experience on the way to Mars. The -- we have no way of simulating that for an extended period of time on the ground. So, we need the space station in order to study microgravity deep space has a different radiation environment than the space station does.  Host: OK.  Kris Lehnhardt: So, there are some elements of deep space on the way to Mars where the radiation is going to be substantially different, but the ISS is still exposed to that same space radiation, just in different ways, and is still a better place to study that than we can do on the ground. We have the ability to create or mimic space radiation on the ground, but nothing beats the real thing.  Host: Mm-hmm. And so, using the space station, as we were saying, is a way to test ideas, or theories about how we are going to take care of those future astronauts. And some of those things have worked out. Tell me about some of those -- those ideas that have been tested.  Nancy Fleming: So, in Exploration Medical Capability, we do a lot of technology demonstrations on the space station. We do medical technology demonstrations. We want to try to find out if -- how fluids work in space, if we can put an IV in in space. We need to find out if we can do -- how we can analyze blood in space. We've done analysis on -- we have done technology demonstrations on imaging, different type of imaging equipment, and if they can be extended to be used for more different types of things. Do you want to tell them about IVGEN?  Kris Lehnhardt: Sure. So, we, a number of years ago, developed a system that would be able to take the water on the space station and generate fluids that can be used intravenously, in case an astronaut were sick or injured.  Host: Is that what the IB-GEN you mentioned is?  Nancy Fleming: IV, yes.  Kris Lehnhardt: IV Generation.  Host: Generation. OK, go --  Nancy Fleming: Like you have an IV in a hospital.  Host: -- yeah, got you. Go ahead, Kris. Continue.  Kris Lehnhardt: That type of system would allow future astronauts to develop and use IV fluid at the time that they need it. Right now, what we have to do is, we fly bags of IV fluid to the space station. Those bags all have expiry dates on them, so if we don't use them, that was mass and volume that could've been used in some other, better way.  Host: Yeah, that trade-off you referred to a few minutes ago.  Kris Lehnhardt: Exactly. So, an integrated system in the future has an environmental control and life support system that's already providing water to the astronauts to drink. We want to take that same water, transform it into IV fluids, and be able to use it in case someone gets sick or injured. That's the kind of system integration and technology development that we hope to continue to do on the space station, to prepare for Mars.  Host: Not to go too far off, but how do you transfer -- transform regular water into IV solutions? What do you -- do you have something you have to add to it?  Kris Lehnhardt: You sterilize the water, and then you add certain solutes to that water to make it -- essentially, you're adding salt to the water, and the technology that is developed there is one that has applications for spaceflight, but also has applications on the ground.   Host: And I guess similar to the way they do it on the ground, except that they -- as you can see, I'm pointing up to the station -- they don't have the benefit of gravity to help mix those components, right?  Kris Lehnhardt: Correct.  Host: The next step in testing -- he thinks -- is going to be when the Artemis program puts astronauts on the Moon, which is further away than the space station, but not nearly as far away as Mars is. Is that the next step in this process, that -- Nancy's shaking --  Nancy Fleming: Absolutely it is.  Host: -- eyes all lit up. Yes, we want that.  Nancy Fleming: It is. You know, the purpose of Artemis is not just the boots on the Moon, but it's also to have a Moon base, and explore more on that Moon -- on the Moon and see what you can get -- what the Moon can provide to us. If there is a Moon base, once that is there, that is -- that will become the best analogue. It will supersede ISS as an analogue for Mars, and it is a stepping stone to Mars. And the reason for that is you will be there long -- long duration, and as Kris mentioned earlier, the galactic cosmic radiation is more similar on the Moon to what you will experience going forward.  Host: On Mars, but not as similar to what they get on the space station.  Nancy Fleming: On ISS, because the ISS is still within the atmosphere, the protection.  Host: The Moon also has some gravity that the space station doesn't have.  Nancy Fleming: Absolutely, and --  Host: And Mars has gravity, although they're not the same as each other, right?  Nancy Fleming: -- correct.  Kris Lehnhardt: So, we refer to that, in most cases, as partial gravity. And so, if Earth is one G, and the space station is zero G, then the Moon is about 1/6th G, and Mars is about 1/3rd. And so, the partial gravity environment of the Moon is something that is very important for us to become more familiar with, and to study in depth. We know that the human body changes significantly on the space station because of the lack of gravity. What we don't know is whether or not -- what amount of gravity the human body needs in order to function in a way that's most similar to Earth, and it may be that the gravity on the Moon is actually sufficient for us to be able to function more like we do on the ground, on Earth, than we do on the space station. And so, being able to study people for long durations on the Moon is going to give us invaluable data.  Host: Longer than just the couple of days that they were there in the Apollo program.  Nancy Fleming: Sure, mm-hmm.  Host: What other things are you thinking that you can do at a -- at a sustainable Moon base that you need to do for the -- for future Mars missions?  Nancy Fleming: So, one of the key things that we've been studying is how medications change in space, in the zero-G environment, and in a radiation environment.  Host: You mean like become less potent over time, or --  Nancy Fleming: Yeah, maybe become less potent, and if they become toxic.  Host: -- oh.  Nancy Fleming: Yeah, so we're very concerned about that.  Host: Not good.  Nancy Fleming: [Laughter] Right. And so, we're actually working with the [Food and Drug Administration] FDA on -- to gather data associated with that, and then we fly medications to the space station, and bring them back, and studying them as well. We'd like to do that on the Moon because of the different environment, and because it is more analogous to heading to Mars for us, to find out which medications can be safe and effective for that longer-duration trip to Mars.  Host: I know that, because I did stories on it a long time ago -- that on the space station, they were touting what was called a telemedicine capability, the ability with two-way video for doctors on the ground, for flight surgeons here in Houston to talk to and to see the astronauts on the station back and forth, and to diagnose them. And that sort of thing is even used on the planet, for people in remote locations, too. Is that not something that you could employ for crews going to Mars?  Kris Lehnhardt: It is, but it's going to look different.  Host: Is, but.  Kris Lehnhardt: But. [laughter] They -- the communication challenges we're going to have going to Mars are significant. So, because we are stuck with the speed of light as it is, we can't get information back from Mars faster than ten minutes, which means that back-and-forth communications between here and Mars will take 20 minutes. And so, trying to have a conversation --  Host: Or more.  Kris Lehnhardt: -- or more. Trying to have a conversation with somebody where you're waiting 20 minutes for their response is a very boring conversation.  Host: And let's be really blunt about this to everybody. The reason for that is because Mars is so far away.  Kris Lehnhardt: Absolutely. If you consider the ISS, and the Moon, and Mars, the Moon is about 1000 times further away from Earth than the ISS, and Mars is about 1000 times further away from the Moon. So, the distances are immense that these communications have to transit, and one of the challenges that we're going to have, even beyond the delay in the communications for Mars, is that during a mission to Mars, there's going to be a period of time where the sun is in between Mars and the Earth. And the sun is going to prevent all communications from going back and forth. So, there's going to be a period of time where we are going to have people on the surface of Mars, probably about a week and a half to two weeks where we can't see or talk to them at all.  Host: At all, wow.  Kris Lehnhardt: So, the ability to provide telemedicine or remote medicine support is something that is very useful but is limited by communications. So, one of our jobs at ExMC is to start trying to develop ways for our crews, our astronauts, to become more Earth-independent, so that they can do their job and take care of themselves if we can't help them.  Host: Sounds like they're going to have to do that for everything, not just their medical care. But yeah, how do you do that? Do you just -- do you send crews who are made up entirely of doctors?  Kris Lehnhardt: As a doctor, that sounds fine to me.  Host: I know you're in line. [laughter] I know you're in line, but that -- [laughter] I mean, do they have to be medical professionals, or is the training that they can get over the course of getting ready going to be sufficient to let engineers and scientists go, too?  Kris Lehnhardt: In order to accomplish the mission, we have to send more than doctors. That's for certain. Right now, NASA intends to send a doctor on a mission to Mars, but there's always a chance that that doctor is the one who becomes sick or injured. So, you have to have a more robust capability than that. So, what we need to do is, we need to find ways to not only train and prepare people on the ground to deal with medical emergencies and maintain health and performance. We need to give them all the tools that they need in-mission to try and help themselves. And so, that includes different things like procedure support. So, we are developing a module right now, software module that we're going to fly to the space station in the spring, and what that module is going to do is, it's going to guide astronauts to perform their own ultrasounds on each other without talking to the ground, and without medical training. So, we're looking at trying to develop all of the tools they're going to need to take care of themselves that will augment whatever their training and preparation was on the ground before they left.  Host: As you think about the fact that they're going to be gone so far away, which also means they're going to be gone for such a long period of time, and they're going to have to learn how to be more self-sufficient, entirely-self-sufficient, because Houston -- Earth can't talk to them. That -- you really have to have them fully prepared to -- as if it were going to be a one-way trip. They've got to be able to take care of themselves.  Nancy Fleming: They have to be able to take care of themselves. Absolutely, they do. And so, again, one of our approaches is enabling them to take care of themselves with a training module, so that they can do refresher training, or just-in-time training. And software will lend itself very well to that, just like with our ultrasound technology that we're developing for them right now. But we are. They will have to become self-sufficient. They're going to become more like explorers that we think of from the past, like Shackleton, or those types of folks who really did go exploring and were in hostile environments. And they had to depend on themselves for their health, and maintenance, and survival, and we are expecting them to thrive, not just survive.  Host: Sure, sure. Now, we referenced this before, and I wanted to get back to it. You talk about the planning that you're doing, and the trade-offs that you're trying to work out about what things you -- they -- you can bring, you need to bring, are most important to bring, are vital, or just luxuries. What kind of variables do you guys have to weigh in this equation to figure out -- to figure out what fits there? I mean, one thing, I realize, is the size of the spacecraft, and you're not building the spacecraft. But they're saying, \"Here's the size of the closet that you get to fill up.\" What do you have to -- give me a sense of the discussions that you all have, and the variables that you look at in trying to determine what goes and what can't.  Kris Lehnhardt: You're absolutely right that when most people talk about the constraints, we talk about the mass, and the volume, and the power that each individual device or piece of technology's going to have. But the other things that are less talked about, but equally important -- one is data. How are we going to manage the flow of all of this information back and forth? If it requires huge amounts of data to be transmitted to Earth, for people on the ground to interpret, and then send back to the astronauts what to do with that information, maybe that's not the best solution. The other thing that we are also looking at are the -- what are going to be the knowledge, skills, and abilities of the crew? If we send a piece of equipment that is designed to be used by a highly-experienced physician, and that person is the person who is sick or injured --  Host: And then not capable of doing it.  Kris Lehnhardt: -- and not capable of doing it, how are the other crew members going to be able to use that equipment? And so, we don't want to send something on a mission to Mars that people are not going to be able to use effectively, because that, again, is a wasted resource. So, we have to weigh the mass, power, and volume, which are the typical things we talk about on spacecraft, but the data, and the knowledge, and the training are equally important.  Nancy Fleming: And the way that we're doing that is, we're building a tool, a model. As you know, a lot of science relies on models to calculate and predict, or capture trends and patterns, and weigh probabilities. And so, one of the key areas of focus that we are doing is building a model that can run all of these complex computations to make the trades even with inputs. So, we can give it a mass constraint, or a power constraint, or a volume constraint, or a data constraint, and we can have it run through a variety of algorithms. And it will help us define what our options are for an optimized medical system. So, we're using math to do that.  Host: Yeah. It's a good thing you have some mathematicians that are available. [laughter] But what are the -- what are the variables that you're considering, that you're building into these algorithms? What are you trying to protect against, or ensure?  Kris Lehnhardt: That's one of the hardest challenges that we have, is trying to predict what's going to occur. And so, the best way that we do that is not only using previous spaceflight data -- so the last 20 years of people on the ISS has given us lots of great information about what kinds of conditions may occur. But we're also trying to use other information that we can get on the ground, from analogues, from similar situations. So, we look at how people provide medical care in remote locations like Antarctica, what happens on a submarine that can't surface and is under the water for weeks at a time. How do they provide medical care? There are also analogue populations on the ground of people who are similar to astronauts, and we can study what happens to them over time and use that information to extrapolate what's going to happen to our astronauts. So, we're trying to take all of that data and incorporate it into our models and perform our risk analysis to come up with a list of the most likely conditions that are going to occur, and we use that list to help define what our medical system is going to be able to provide care for.  Host: I would assume that you're trying to design a system that could provide whatever medical care they need.  Nancy Fleming: Absolutely. [laughter]  Host: We're not drawing a line that says, \"We'll be able to take care of you up to this point, and if you get something worse, too bad.\"  Kris Lehnhardt: One of the challenges that we have is that, at the end of the day, we are going to be constrained in what we can take, and we're going to have to make some hard decisions. But we want our astronauts to be able to use parts of our system in flexible ways. We want them to improvise, and be prepared for the unexpected, because one of the things we have learned on the space station is that things occur that we were not predicting.  Host: Yeah.  Kris Lehnhardt: And the more time we have people spending in space, and the more people who go to space, the more data we get to tell us about that.  Host: Right.  Kris Lehnhardt: And a great example is a recent paper just came out that was published that talks about an astronaut who had a blood clot. No one was anticipating blood clots in astronauts. We did not have a capability to treat that problem within our models. So, the more time we spend in space, the more people we send to space, the better the data is that we can use to make our predictions going forward.  Host: I'm aware that Human Research Program is involved with running a lot of different analogues -- not just natural analogues, like Antarctica, but ones that have been built here to try to gather some data. Have they been fruitful for you?  Kris Lehnhardt: Those analogues -- one of the great things that we can study in those environments is how different people work together. And one of the things we know for an exploration crew, like the astronauts going to Mars, is that they are going to have to be a highly effective team. And if a medical emergency is going to occur, how are the people in that environment going to respond to that emergency? How are they going to know what to do, what procedures to follow, and how are they going to execute on that training that they've had to take care of their sick or injured crew member? Because those folks -- they train for years together. They become like family to each other. So, if you could imagine what it'd be like, trying to provide medical care to someone in your family if they have a medical event, and you do it in a really difficult environment -- we need to know how they're going to respond. And so, using these analogues on the ground to study how people respond in these kinds of circumstances are going to help us to develop better procedures that the astronauts going to Mars can use.  Host: I think it's important to point out, too, that NASA's not doing all this work on its own. You guys are involved with a lot of people outside the gates here in trying to build this up. Tell me about that.  Nancy Fleming: Sure. We have agreements with other federal agencies. As I mentioned earlier, we're working with federal drug administration to help us with our pharmaceutical studies. We have been -- we've asked the Mayo Clinic for -- we're working with the Mayo Clinic to gather incidence rates for conditions. We also work with international partners. We have agreements with Canadian Space Agency, and HRP as a whole works with the European Space Agency. We were working with them on a technology demonstration coming up soon, in the next year, for a medical device as well. And so, as with anything, the more diverse minds and capabilities you bring to solve a problem, the greater outcome you get of that solution. And so, we have partnerships -- in fact, our teams of scientists, and clinicians, and engineers are stationed all over the United States. We have virtual teams that are part of our element.  Host: They're not all just working here in Houston.  Nancy Fleming: They're not here. They're not all here at Johnson Space Center. They're at other space centers, and they're at just remote locations.  Host: As you do this work, try to figure out what is needed, what sort of communications are you still having with the people who are building the spaceships, in order to make sure that plans that -- you know, I have a genius plan, but it won't work on this vehicle. I mean, you don't want to get into that position. So how do you still work with the spaceship builders?  Kris Lehnhardt: We have a team that works within our element that is focused on systems engineering, and what you're describing is exactly that. What we are trying to do is develop the information that vehicle designers and mission planners are going to need early on in their plans, so they can incorporate a crew health and performance system into their spaceships, essentially. And so, the model you described earlier, where someone says, \"Here's the closet. You can fill the closet with whatever you want\" -- we are actually trying to change that paradigm to one where a crew health and performance system is integrated into the spacecraft, like every other system is. So, if the spacecraft provides oxygen to the crew members, which it hopefully does in order for them to live --  Host: It does. [laughter]  Kris Lehnhardt: -- then --  Host: As I understand it --  Kris Lehnhardt: -- why, as a -- on the medical side, should I have to have separate oxygen for medical purposes? If the vehicle already does that, I need to leverage that capability from the vehicle. And all I need to do is provide an interface between the vehicle and the patient. So, the integration and the systems engineering functions that our group is doing is trying to influence these programs early on in their development, so that we can have those systems, that crew health and performance system, as part of the spacecraft.  Nancy Fleming: And one of the ways that we do that -- our systems engineering team -- is using model-based systems engineering. And in fact, our systems engineering team is working -- is part of an agency initiative, headquarters initiative that is trying to infuse model-based systems engineering in all of the future programs. And so, we are working at the forefront of the agency towards that goal. Our team has created -- has a model, and has created requirements, concepts of operations, functional decomposition of those requirements, so that when any -- a program like Artemis comes online, that they have something to start from for the requirements to build their spacecraft.  Host: In general, if it can be said, when you think about crews on two-year-long, three-year-long missions, are you thinking that they are more likely to get a cold, or, you know, have an old back injury flare up, as opposed to break an arm or something? Is there a certain kind of thing that you've come to believe is more likely to happen?  Kris Lehnhardt: As I said before, the biggest challenge is probably trying to predict the unpredictable. But we also know, as I said before, that these are all normal people, and we try to send up as healthy of people as we can. But at the end of the day, they have a lot of the same problems that we have. They have backaches, and headaches, and rashes, and we have to be able to manage those kind of more minor problems to prevent them from becoming more serious problems. The other kinds of issues that they are -- that they could have, that we people have on the ground, we try to prevent or screen out before we send them. So, we ideally don't want to send someone to space that's going to have a heart attack, or a stroke, but at the end of the day, because we can't predict everything that's going to occur, we need to have a list of capabilities that we can take with us, that are going to manage a wide variety of conditions. So, our goal, ultimately, is to develop that list of conditions and capabilities so we can design the system necessary to treat them. History has shown us that lots of different things can occur. Apollo 13 is a great example of someone who became sick and was completely unpredicted from happening.  Host: Right.  Kris Lehnhardt: And it turns out that, even when that person did become sick, we didn't have the capability onboard to effectively treat them. So, it was a good thing they were already on their way home again. We don't want that to happen on the way to Mars.  Host: Right, and -- but it's -- you know, it certainly could, and you're trying to come up with a way to -- that those people can take care of themselves. Because once they take off for Mars, they can't turn around and come back for years, literally years. In an earlier podcast segment, Jennifer Fogarty, your boss, talked about not only developing things that people will need, but also a decision support culture. And that strikes me as being really important. You're sending some people out there on their own to take care of themselves, and this is a way that we can help them after they're gone.  Nancy Fleming: That is true, and for ExMC, we have just started our decision support research. We want to ensure that the crews have the capability to be able to rely on the information from the ground, and the technologies that can help them decide between two illnesses or help them decide which pieces of equipment are the best things to use to solve this -- to help with this illness, or this injury. And so, we have kicked off research to develop decision support. That is a key component to having crews being able to take care of themselves on their way to Mars.  Host: And it struck me, too, that it's a way to give them some confidence that what they're doing is the right thing to do --  Nancy Fleming: Yes.  Host: -- as they take care of themselves. This is fascinating, and I wish you luck as you continue to do it. Nancy Fleming and Kris Lehnhardt, thank you very much.  Nancy Fleming: Thank you.  Kris Lehnhardt: Thank you.  [ Music ]  Host: If you're like me, and you watch some science fiction movies and television, and you can come away thinking that most of the problems of human spaceflight are pretty easy to solve -- once you get better shielding technology and artificial gravity locked in, and then I think we'll find that a lot of the medical questions will pretty much solve themselves. But until then, hearing Nancy Fleming and Kris Lehnhardt talk about working through the real problems facing humans trying to live out from under the safety of our atmosphere is terrifically interesting.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host):  Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 57, Hazard Number One: Radiation.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  On this podcast we bring in the experts -- NASA scientists, engineers, and astronauts -- all to let you know the coolest information about what's going on right here at NASA.  So today this podcast, this episode is part one of a five-part series on the hazards of human space flight.  So a human mission to Mars is extremely complex and challenging and has hazards such as radiation, isolation and confinement, distance from Earth, gravity, and hostile and closed environments.  And they're being studied in ground-based analogs here on Earth, in laboratories, and of course, on the International Space Station.  So today we're going to talk about that first one, radiation.  We're talking with Zarana Patel, a portfolio lead scientist here at the Johnson Space Center.  Zarana is responsible for management and scientific oversight of degenerative tissue risk for the space radiation program element.   So if you missed it, I talked with Dr. Mike Barratt last week.  He's a NASA astronaut.  And he gave a nice overview of all five hazards, including radiation.  And as a space traveler himself and a medical doctor, he gave a nice two-minute overview of why we're concerned about radiation in the first place and what we know so far.  What exactly -- you said, you know, from small effects to, you know, lethal effects of radiation, what exactly is radiation doing to the human body?    Mike Barratt: So when we think about space flight radiation, we're mostly concerned with charged particles, which with electrons and protons and some heavier particles that are basically stellar products coming from supernova explosions and energized gas clouds.  And I'll have to caveat that by saying we also have issues with neutrons because those can be formed by interaction of these heavy particles with structure.  But these are traveling very fast and they possess a lot of energy.  And so when they hit something that's of value to us, such as macromolecules like DNA, they can actually induce direct damage.  And if you get a large enough dose, they can actually kill cells.  It's some of those smaller doses that we're a little bit concerned about because they can damage DNA in such a way -- in fact, many different ways -- that can potentially cause cancers, cause lethality from cancers many years after your exposures.  And there's a lot of uncertainty about what dose of what charged particle will affect -- will cause what effect on the human body.   And so that's one of our major areas of interest in our research.    Host:  Do we have radiation studies on the International Space Station?    Mike Barratt: Absolutely.  So just like a radiation technologist or a nuclear energy worker, we have a very highly-monitored environment.  And every crew member wears a radiation badge, just like any of those people in those industries that I mentioned.  We have area detectors which map out the radiation exposure of each area of the Space Station.  We have furthering our suite of detectors, charged particle directional detectors, which tell you what the charges are and from what direction they come.  And those are the particles that come in from the sun and from galactic cosmic rays.  And, of course, we have our ground observations.  We composite all those together along with satellite data as well and we get the best picture we can of the radiation environment for low-earth orbit.    Host:  So that clip was from last week's episode.  It was called Dr. Spaceman, where we go through Dr. Barratt's story and an overview of the five hazards.  But today we're diving deep into the first part on radiation with Dr. Zarana Patel.  So with no further delay, let's go right to it.  Enjoy.     [ Music ]    All right, Zarana, thank you so much for joining me today to talk about radiation.    Zarana Patel:  You're welcome.  Thank you for having me.    Host:  You're welcome.  This is an interesting, interesting concept.  Because it's something that I think is one of the main concerns, I would almost assume, whenever people talk about, \"Well, what do we need to be worried about whenever we go out into space?\"  Radiation is just always one of those things that comes up.  But I want to start with a question of why is radiation such a concern?  What do we have to be worried about?    Zarana Patel:  Yeah.  And the real -- the pretty significant thing there is that -- the type of radiation you're going to encounter in space is different than the types of radiation we encounter here on Earth.  In space you're exposed to this thing called HZE radiation, so that stands for high-Z, which is atomic mass, and high-E, which is energy.  So these -- these heavy ions, they have a lot of mass, they have a lot of energy.  And in that way they are very different from gamma rays or X-rays that we're going to see on Earth.  They're densely ionizing, which means that as they move along their target volume, they have the ability to cause a lot of damage within this one core track.    Host:  Wow.    Zarana Patel:  And they also have these little offshoots from the core track called delta rays.  So these delta rays can also go off to neighboring cells or volumes and causes additional damage.  So for something sensitive like DNA where one hit can be a point of failure, right, one hit can causes a mutation that can propagate into further damage, it can propagate into cancer.  When one hit is a point of failure and you have a lot of complex damage that you can't repair, it becomes a big problem.    Host:  And you're talking about the human body, right?    Zarana Patel:  Mm-hmm.    Host:  You're talking about when this heavy -- this space form of radiation hits a living organism?    Zarana Patel:  Exactly.  The other difference is that in space, there's a type of dose rate that is in space -- it's different.  It's a lot of chronic exposure, ever-present but at low doses; however, as on Earth you get single X-ray or CT scan, you know, it's a single 15-minute exposure or an hour exposure and then you're done until the next time.    Host:  Hmm.  Yeah, so when I go to the dentist and they do the snapshot, it's really just a quick second there.    Zarana Patel:  Exactly.    Host:  Yeah.  But this long form -- and that's why, you know, when I go to the dentist, they put on this big lead vest, right, and then they shoot me with radiation.  And the dental hygienist is going around the corner because they doesn't want to be a part of it.  So, you know, even just that little bit, everyone's, like, real nervous about.    Zarana Patel:  Yeah.  And I think it is important to note that on Earth we have radiation protection standards.  So likewise, we would have radiation protection standards for any astronauts we send into space.    Host:  And the hard thing would be controlling and keeping those standards with such a persistent presence of it.  That's got to be pretty challenging.    Zarana Patel:  The monitoring of it is actually fairly straightforward now.  It wasn't always like that.  But now that we've developed newer technologies, newer dosimeters, things that measure the radiation, things like the MSL rad tool on Curiosity Rover went from here to Mars.  And on its way there, it took radiation -- it took measurements of the radiation environment.  So now we have a really good idea of what's happening from here to Mars and on the surface of Mars.  So a lot of this data we're compiling and keeping track of so we understand what the space radiation environment's going to be like when we actually send humans there and back.    Host:  So you understand the environment.  I guess where the questions lie is what happens to the human body, right?    Zarana Patel:  Yeah, there is huge uncertainty in terms of the biological responses for these space radiation exposures.  So that's where a lot of our research within the Human Research Program focuses on, quantifying the biological responses and then doing what we can to mitigate them.    Host:  Right.  Yeah, and if I'm going to the dentist and they're going around the corner when I'm getting blasted with X-rays, I'm sure no one's really going to sign up to get blasted with radiation to find out what happens to the body.    Zarana Patel:  Yeah, no one's -- unfortunately, we cannot irradiate people.     [ Laughter ]    Host:  You say that from a scientific perspective.    Zarana Patel:  Yes, yes, of course.  So we rely heavily on animal and cellular models to gather the evidence we need to characterize a risk from space radiation and to do -- evaluate countermeasures.    Host:  Okay.  So what's the technique there?  What are we doing to find out?    Zarana Patel:  Yeah, that's a great question.  Most -- most of the elements here at NASA rely on some form of ground analog to do a lot of their testing.  And we have a similar one called the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory.  It's housed at Brookhaven National Labs, and it's basically the top of the line facility, probably the most sophisticated facility in the world where you can simulate space radiation exposures.  It also has a nice facility onsite for biological experiments, which is essential since we are using animal and cellular models.  So it combines this capability to do long-term animal studies and cellular work along with a heavy ion accelerator.    Host:  Hmm.  So what do -- what do they show us?  What are we beginning to understand with these tests?    Zarana Patel:  So to date there are four health risks from space radiation exposure that we identified.  The first one is cancer.  The risk of radiation-induced carcinogenesis, and that includes epithelial cancers and leukemias.  And this is actually the biggest contributor to this permissible exposure limit that -- that's the standard we set for our astronauts.  The next one is the risk of in-flight and late CNS decrements.  So CNS is central nervous system.  And basically it's the risk of behavioral or cognitive decrements either in-flight or late post-mission, which can manifest in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's.    Host:  Oh, wow.    Zarana Patel:  And this one we're targeting pathology that can have commonalities between those disorders and cardiovascular disease, which brings me to the next risk, which is the risk of radiation-induced cardiovascular disease.  But it's not just cardiovascular disease, it includes things like cataracts and other degenerative tissue effects, such as immune decrements, respiratory and digestive dysfunction, early aging or premature aging.  And finally, the last one is the risk of acute radiation syndromes.  This is a really specific one for solar fares or what we call solar particle events.  So this one is a more intermittent but large dose exposure from a solar flare.  And you have things like skin burns, prodromal responses, nausea.  This one is fairly effectively shielded against.    Host:  Really?  Okay.  And is it -- nausea, it sounds like a short-term thing.  It would be like you would go through this blast and it would be sort of a short-term thing.  Whereas this sounds like, you know, cancer and cataracts, they seem like very long-term effects.    Zarana Patel:  Yeah.  There's these acute effects and there's these late effects.  And the latency between the two can vary, you know, in terms of minutes to decades.  So for acute radiation syndrome, you will manifest immediately and over a period of months.  But the radiation exposure you get initially will also contribute to your late effects of cancer, [inaudible], and cardiovascular disease.  Because your radiation exposures are accumulated.    Host:  I see, I see.  Now, this is -- this has got to be related to a lot of other effects, too.  Because, you know, looking at radiation specifically, now there's all these other hazards that we're going to talk about in this series, the isolation, distance from Earth, the fluid shifts and some of the effects of the altered gravity that are going to compound based on these radiation.  Because radiation -- are you looking at other areas as well beyond radiation and how radiation might amplify these effects?    Zarana Patel:  Yes, for sure.  The chief scientist always likes to say that the body is experiencing this whole body outcome in space; you're not really experiencing any one of these hazards as a stand-alone.  So you have to account for the fact that there might be additive responses, or synergistic responses, or antagonistic responses.  So does radiation simply add on with microgravity or altered gravity, or are they synergistic in that they can cause an even larger effect in either two alone or combined?  Or do they, when combined, cause a decreased effect?  So these are things that we definitely have within our knowledge gaps for these four risks and we do have to evaluate whether or not they're acting in any kind of interacting manner with these other hazards.    Host:  Well, let's start with kind of what we know starting from the beginning.  You know, we're starting to venture farther into space in the '60s, especially during the Apollo Program.  Apollo 8 was the first time that astronauts actually went past low-earth orbit and now we're going towards the moon.  What is the radiation environment that they sort of went on?  And a lot of the other Apollo astronauts after them, too?  What was the radiation environment like for them?    Zarana Patel:  So with -- with the early programs, they were obviously very short durations and they were at relatively lower altitudes.  The radiation exposures there were fairly low and their concern was mostly solar particle events.  But as the mission architecture changed, you're going to higher altitudes, longer durations and now beyond low-earth orbit, you do have to account for the galactic cosmic radiation that's going to be omnipresent.  And basically, with increasing time, you have increasing exposure to GCR.  So you are going to have a lot of deep space radiation exposures on your way from Earth to Mars and back.  You're going to have to account for that.  And then for a three-year Mars mission, it's going to be about an order of magnitude higher than the current levels of exposures we're seeing right now on the ISS.    Host:  Do we know if the radiation levels would sort of plateau after a certain point and they've done their damage and that's as far as it's going to go?  Or will it be seriously keep being worse and worse the longer that they're out there?    Zarana Patel:  That's an interesting question.  I don't know if there will be a plateau or not.  But I think the question right now of whether or not there's a threshold dose is important for things like the risk of heart diseases.    Host:  Oh, okay.    Zarana Patel:  So the heart and cardiovascular system is a fairly -- what they call a resistant system.  It can take some damage and still output in terms of function normally.  So this is called a deterministic risk.  There's a threshold dose at which you will start seeing effects.  So current evidence to date suggests that the risk of heart disease has a threshold dose, and right now it might be about half a gray.  But as people are reanalyzing the epidemiological data and more data's coming in, there are suggestions that there actually may be lower and lower thresholds or no threshold at all.  That makes it go from a deterministic risk to a probabilistic risk like cancer, which means that any radiation exposure accounts for -- includes some level of risk.  So, for example, on a Mars mission when you are nearing half a gray levels of radiation exposure, that's -- that's at the level of a threshold dose of radiation-induced heart diseases.  That's when we become concerned.    Host:  Now, what's a gray?  A half a gray, what's that?    Zarana Patel:  So the gray is a standard unit of measure for radiation, how much you're actually absorbing in your body.  But that can be translated in terms of biological effects using some kind of quality factors.  So you might absorb half a gray in your body, but biologically your body might feel like it's one -- you might absorb half a gray in your body but biologically your body might feel like you're getting 1.2 sieverts of damage.  And a sievert is sort of this scaling factor or ends up being a scaling parameter to account for quality difference from a space radiation and other Earth exposures.  So if you absorb half a gray of radiation exposure, it might feel like one gray of gamma exposure, and that's what the sievert sort of translates into.    Host:  So is -- from your perspective, you know, studying radiation and sort of kind of understanding these thresholds, these limits, is there a limit to how long we can spend out in space before we have to come home?    Zarana Patel:  Yes, so NASA sets the permissible exposure limits.  Right now the limit is at 3% excess read.  So it's 3% excess risk of death from cancer.  And this -- this excess career limit is the same for both men and women, but the risk function, it's a function of age at exposure, sex, and smoking status.  So we know that the older you are, the less likely you are to have an increased risk of cancer from radiation and exposure.  We also know that there's some evidence suggesting that women are more sensitive to radiation exposure and certain types of cancers as a result than men.  So yes, your career limit is going to be the same for all crew, but depending on your age, sex status, and smoking status, the number of safe days that you can spend in space will vary.    Host:  Hmm.  So I guess Mars missions are going to be pretty tough.  That's several years?    Zarana Patel:  Yes, three years is a long time.  And the accumulated dose there is going to be pushing the permissible exposure limits that we have right now.    Host:  Wow.  So what do we know based on some of our studies on the International Space Station?  One of the best parts is it's a platform for understanding how the human body reacts to being in space.  Now, there's a little bit of extra shielding from the magnetic sphere, right, then maybe when we get further out in space.  So radiation -- I guess we're still learning a little bit, but I guess not as much as we would in space travel.  So what do we know now?    Zarana Patel:  In terms of the ISS, the -- it's in low-earth orbit.  So like you mentioned, it is protected by the earth's magnetosphere from a lot of GCR -- not all of it, but a lot of it.  And the six-month missions and the one-month missions that we're currently doing, you're going to receive a fairly low amount of radiation.  Of course, if you're flying multiple missions, they will accumulate, like I mentioned.    Host:  Right.    Zarana Patel:  So with low-earth orbit, your risk is still within the limits that we set.  When you go to the moon and depending on the mission architecture for the moon and then the deep space -- deep space sorties, you will be pushing the limits that we set for both men and women.  As far as these studies on the ISS, like I said, because these doses are so low, within the human cohort -- the human astronaut cohort -- you really can't distinguish a single signal from radiation versus the noise that you're going to get.  So, for example, if you take a look at radiation-induced heart disease, the entire astronaut cohort is probably 350 give or take.  If you look at -- if you try to identify is there an increased risk of space radiation-induced heart disease in that cohort, you won't be able to find a signal that is statistically significant.  So we know there's a risk because in epidemiological studies these are human ground studies from terrestrial exposures.   These cohorts sizes go from tens of thousands of people.  So when you consider a cohort, that's 350 to tens of thousand of people, you can better distinguish the signal from the radiation-induced heart disease compared to the noise.  So we know that there is a risk, we just can't identify it in a smaller cohort like the astronaut cohort.  So we have to rely heavily on the terrestrial data as well as all the data that we're going to compile at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory.    Host:  Right.  Are you doing different sorts of tests in the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory, or are just doing the same tests with a lot of samples?    Zarana Patel:  Yeah, we rely on animal studies mostly.  And we have the development of this GCR simulator facility, which will have the capability to cycle through multiple ions and simulate the reference field which is basically what you would experience in space.  The GCR reference field in space is very complex.  You can have a number of ions represented in that field, you know, maybe up to 20 ions.  But on the ground we're not going to use 20 ions.  Maybe we'll simplify it to five and cycle through them repeatedly to expose animals to that kind of field.  You also have to account for the dose rate.  You have to give the animals the small dose over a large period of time to simulate the Mars exposure.  So those are the kind of tests we're going to be doing.    Host:  So how well do these tests -- you know, we're talking about cells, we're talking about animals -- how well do they translate to what's going to happen to the human body?    Zarana Patel:  Yeah, that is a very good question and one of the biggest challenges that people who use and rely on animal models have in general: How well do these animal and cell data that we're going to collect translate and how can we translate them to the human condition, to the astronaut condition?  So we have to rely on this vertical and horizontal transition paradigm.  So vertical translation just means going from bench to bedside.  Going from the lab bench, including biologists, chemists, and including all the way up to the top, the clinicians that are going to be implementing this kind of work and interacting with the humans.  And then the horizontal translation just means going from different -- just being interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary.  We're going to talk to physicists, we're going to talk to modelers, we're going to talk to epidemiologists, we're going to talk to biologists and chemists.  We're going to talk to managers and vehicle design people as well.  So you have to include basically this whole entire field to account translation from a cell or an animal to a human.    Host:  Right.  Because you don't want to be isolated to just your perspective.    Zarana Patel:  No.    Host:  This grander perspective really helps you understand what's going to happen, right?    Zarana Patel:  Exactly.    Host:  Yeah.  So you said you're mostly from the biological perspective, but, you know, having someone that understands physics maybe a little bit more can help you understand?    Zarana Patel:  Exactly.  And I think that's where my bioengineering background really comes into play here because I was able to experience not just biological aspect but working towards the engineering aspect.  And the final goal for bioengineering is to apply it to the human condition.  So in that sense it was really helpful for me to sort of bridge the gap between, for example, the way -- the language a physicist might use compared to the language that a biologist might use, compared to the language that a modeler might use.  In that case sometimes people are talking past themselves and they don't even realize it because they're not talking in the same language.    Host:  Right.    Zarana Patel:  So it helps to sort of communicate between these different kinds of mindsets.    Host:  Right.  You guys are experts in your fields, and so you have kind of your own jargon.  Then expert with his own jargon is trying to tell you, that person, you know, his or her perspective and maybe kind of you're not speaking the same language.  That makes a lot of sense.    Zarana Patel:  Yeah.  And, of course, at NASA we use -- on top of that we use acronyms to confuse people additionally.  But, you know, I think a great example of just how complex the radiation issue is, is if you think -- if you go back in your mind to this very small ion, that's a physics level here.  So you're involving physicists -- both basic and applied physicists.  And as it encounters DNA and is doing all this damage, you're looking at chemistry, radio chemistry.  So now you have a radio chemist come into play here.  And then you propagate your damage into the cells into multiple tissues, you're at a biological level here.  And then these multiple tissues are interacting in the whole body system.  You're at a clinical level.  And you have to take all of these things into consideration when you're, you know, doing vehicle design, doing mission architecture, doing radiation mitigation and countermeasure planning.    Host:  Well, let's go back to your expertise, which is in bioengineering.  That's something that's a little bit over my head.  What does bioengineering kind of -- what's that field look like?    Zarana Patel:  I chose bioengineering because it is -- it is this attraction of being able to do whatever it is you want to do.  Bioengineering really takes biology and then aspects of any kind of engineering.  So if you're really interested in computers, you could do data informatics.  You can weed out data -- and data informatics is actually a huge field right now because there's a lot of data that people are collecting and we don't know how to weed it out in terms of genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics.  And we have to have people who are smart enough to take these datasets and weed out data that is important versus data that is noise and so on.  So that's computer systems engineering.  If you want to do something like mechanical engineering -- for example, let's take 3D printing.  If you want to 3D print a thumb or a hand for someone, that requires not just mechanical engineering but ideas for -- that requires not just mechanical engineering but the concept of biomechanics as well.   How do you fit this mechanical thing you've created to the human that you're going to need to use it for?  So that's mechanical engineering.  Electrical engineering is also a huge, huge field with bioengineering.  And these memory chips things you can plant in yourself or on yourself, right, to do telemetry, to do telemetry diagnosis for yourself.  For example, if I wanted to slap a sticker on myself to measure my sweat -- saline concentrations or my sugar levels, they're developing things to do that as well.  Bioengineering has this huge potential that you can target it to whatever it is you want to do.    Host:  Yeah.    Zarana Patel:  As long as you apply it to the human condition.    Host:  Right, yeah.  It seems like how does -- that's exactly it -- how does technology fit with biology?  That's really -- that sounds like kind what it is and meshing those two field.    Zarana Patel:  Yeah.  And how can you use technology that's available and modify it to advance the human condition?    Host:  So how -- how does this help with your understanding of radiation and how that affects the human body?    Zarana Patel:  I think it's just in the sense that I had a perspective of the multidisciplinary nature of things that you can apply to the radiation problem, which does span this huge gap, not this huge spectrum from physics to clinic.    Host:  So then -- so you're field in bioengineering really kind of helps you to understand the effects mainly it sounds like the human body.  That's really -- that's really the focus here.  Now, I'm sure radiation has impacts on some engineering components, too, and structure and whatever.  We'll focus mainly on the human body.  Now, as we're going to destinations like the moon, like Mars, what is the radiation environment like?  Let's go -- let's skip the moon for now and go to Mars; what is the radiation environment like on Mars?    Zarana Patel:  So on the surface of Mars, actually the dose rates are going to be similar to what the crew on ISS will see.  The composition will be a little bit different, but the dose rates are very similar.  So ISS, you're getting a lot of shielding from the Earth's magnetosphere, so you don't get the lower energy GCR, but you do get a potential for solar flares and you get some higher-energy GCR.  If you move outside of ISS orbit to the moon, your dose rates are about one and a half times that of the ISS.  Then you go to deep space, that's where you don't have any protection from the magnetosphere or a planetary body.  You have risk of solar flares and you have GCR, which is always present.  So your dose rates can range from two to three times that of the ISS.  That is where you're accumulating a lots of the dose.  Once you get to Mars, Mars has an atmosphere that can provide some protection.  It can also provide protection just by its planetary body system.   So it can shield some GCR in that sense, which is why the dose rates, again, come down to approximately the same as the ISS.    Host:  So it's mainly -- that's interesting.  I always thought that the radiation environment on Mars was much worse.  But I guess if you take all of these different things into perspective, one thing that I thought was curious was just being on a planetary body or even the moon -- being on the moon gives you a little bit of protection.  How's that working?    Zarana Patel:  Exactly.  It's called planetary shielding because you have a sphere and the GCR is just always present.  It's omni present.  So it's surrounding the sphere.  But if you're on the surface of the sphere, wherever the planet is building you from the GCR is where you're getting protection from it.  So the ground itself provides some protection from GCR.  And that way you're only getting GCR from maybe 180 degrees.    Host:  So I guess what's nice about Mars is that it is a planet.  So I guess there is that element of being a planet and you don't have that radiation coming from the other side.  Could you maybe burrow underground and use more of the planet to give you more protection?  Will that work?    Zarana Patel:  Yes, for sure the planet dirt -- I think it's called regolith -- you can use that as a shield around yourself.  But you also have to account for these things called secondary particles.  So any particles that make it through and impact the dirt that your surrounded by will fragment in that volume and create additional secondary particles.  So they interact more and more whether it's shielding or the structure of your house or the dirt that you're surrounded by.  They're going to generate secondaries that can still impact you biologically speaking.    Host:  Regolith, though, is regolith -- I thought that was on airless bodies.  Is that just the moon or is it -- is it -- I guess Mars, is that soil?    Zarana Patel:  Yeah.    Host:  Is that how it works?    Zarana Patel:  There's Martian regolith, there's lunar regolith.    Host:  Regolith.  Okay, okay.  Yeah, so that -- that just gives you just that little bit of protection.  So maybe, yeah, would that -- if you're let's say a mission to Mars, let's just say around three years in a mission profile.  You're going out, say, nine months transit.  You have to stay there for upwards of a year.  I guess using the planet around you to reduce that amount of exposure, now that buys you a little bit of time.  Because, you know, you said as you're out in space, the clock is ticking for how much exposure -- radiation exposure you're getting.  Maybe that will get you a little bit of extra protection.    Zarana Patel:  Yes, for sure.  The problem is when you go and come back is where you're getting the largest dose.    Host:  Yeah.    Zarana Patel:  And the shielding there is going to be difficult on the vehicle.  Because it will require a large mass of shielding and it is not likely to be cost efficient.    Host:  Yeah, so okay.  So let's go there.  Let's go to the interplanetary part.  This is where the -- you're getting three times the amount, I guess, of -- is it three times the amount of Earth or three times the amount of ISS?    Zarana Patel:  Three times the amount of ISS.    Host:  Of ISS, okay.  So three times the amount.  So this is where you're going to have that largest impact.  What sort of technology can we look at?  Let's say -- let's take away realistic technologies for a while and just say what is the technology that's required, that is going to provide you radiation protection?    Zarana Patel:  Well, if you can get there faster, that's probably the biggest thing.    Host:  Sure.    Zarana Patel:  Because that minimizes the time you have to spend in space.    Host:  Propulsion.    Zarana Patel:  Propulsion is going to be the big one.  There's also been talk of magnetic shielding.  Maybe I didn't mention, but GCR is not on the electromagnetic spectrum.  So on the electromagnetic spectrum you have wavelengths that -- on one end you have very large, long wavelengths with low frequencies, things like radio waves and microwaves that you mentioned.  And then you progress to higher and higher energies and higher and higher frequencies.  So the light that we see is on the visible length spectrum -- visible light spectrum.  And then you have UV spectrum.  And within this UV spectrum you have delineation between non-ionizing and ionizing radiation.  So basically, ionizing radiation just means that the radiation has capability to excite an electron and to knock it out of its -- out of the orbit of the whole nucleus.  And non-ionizing radiation doesn't have that capability.  So within the UV spectrum, UVA and lower-energy UVB wavelengths are considered non-ionizing.   And then the higher-energy UVB and all of UVC is considered ionizing.  And then after -- after beyond the UV spectrum you have X-rays and gamma rays, which are the highest energy, highest frequency wavelengths.  And those are definitely ionizing.  But GCR, galactic cosmic rays, aren't even on electromagnetic spectrum.  They are technically not even rays.  As I mentioned, they're heavy ions.    Host:  Right, right    Zarana Patel:  Electromagnetic wavelengths carry their energy in these little packets.  They carry their energy in these little packets called photons.  And photons can act as both light and wave particles.  But GCR is a ion, it's a particle.  And it has a mass, it has an electric charge, and it can be affected by magnetic fields.  So it is definitely ionizing, but it is not an electromagnetic wavelength.  So if you consider shielding, if you -- if you want to have some kind of magnetic shield, it could potentially disrupt the GCR field around the vehicle and in a way that sun does or our Earth magnetosphere does to protect us.    Host:  Ah, okay.  So generating sort of like a small, I guess, magnetic field.    Zarana Patel:  I'm not sure that there -- I'm not really sure about the details of it.    Host:  Oh, okay.    Zarana Patel:  But when you -- when you project a magnetic field around a vehicle, that in turn will disrupt the GCR flux that comes in.  So I don't think it's -- the interaction is generating the field.  I think you have to generate the field and then that protects you.    Host:  Okay.  I heard that water was a really good one, too.    Zarana Patel:  Yes. So things like water or polyethylene are really good shielding.  And the good news is you're already going to have water on the vehicle.  You're going to have to carry your water.  So there are -- there are schematics where, for example, for a solar particle event you would go into one -- one area and surround or repack the water bladders around your habitat so that you could provide temporary shielding that way.    Host:  Ah, okay.  So a solar flare has happened.  We can detect it a little bit early.  We got a little bit of time before we know it's going to hit the spacecraft.  Then they get word, \"Hey, shelter.\"  So they go and surround themselves with water.    Zarana Patel:  Exactly.    Host:  Okay.    Zarana Patel:  The problem is that it's probably -- the water shielding is not sufficient to protect from GCR.  So you would need a lot of -- a lot of depth of water or polyethylene, which just isn't going to be realistic.    Host:  Right, yeah.  You're not going to be a bring a pool with you to Mars.    Zarana Patel:  No [Laughs].    Host:  Okay.  So -- so let's go back.  We kind of mentioned I think briefly some of the effects that we know that are the cause of radiation or at least have some sort of impact.  Going down the list, one of them was the cardiovascular system.  What's happening there?    Zarana Patel:  So that -- that is a great question.  What we think is happening is that radiation in general, whether it's gamma rays or GCR, is causing endothelial dysfunction.  So your vessels have different layers within them, and one layer is called the endothelial cells.  And this is the layer that interact with the blood.  And when you have dysfunction of this layer, you can start creating barrier dysfunctions within it.  You can also start creating adhesions of macrophages and immune cells, and that's the first step in atherosclerosis.  Basically, you're laying down plaque into your arteries.  And when you have the endothelial barrier disrupted, you start this process.  So this is what we think is happening with low levels of space radiation, but the research program we have in place is doing a lot more work to characterize if that's exactly what's happening.    Host:  Now what about -- you said there was some effects on the brain, too?  You mentioned Alzheimer's.  But one thing I was thinking of is, I guess, more of a real-time effect, I guess, if you're getting blasted these particles.  Could it potentially affect your mood and your emotions or the way that you interpret information?  Anything like that happening in the brain?    Zarana Patel:  Yeah, there is a risk for in-flight CNS decrements to happen.  And so the research to date that we've had in animals suggests that, you know, at low doses similar to what you might see in the Mars missions, you can potentially generate these kinds of decrements that can then go on and translate to mission-affecting behaviors.  Whether or not that's actually going to happen is something that the research still has to play out.  And I think that Dr. [inaudible] can talk more about that.    Host:  Okay, okay.  Yeah, he'll be next in our series, so that will be great.  Thinking about some of the -- we were talking a little bit about the ways that we can protect from radiation.  But like you said, this is a phenomenon that's all around us.  It's, you said, omnipresent.  Is there a way that knowing that radiation might have -- it's going to have an effect.  You know, if we send astronauts below low-earth orbit, it's going to have an effect.  Is there something we can do to maybe reverse the effects or anything to sort of help reverse the effects of radiation?    Zarana Patel:  Yeah.  So within our research, we've noticed that the commonality among these risks is -- there is one commonality, and the commonality is chronic inflammation.  So something that targets inflammatory pathways would be a good first step to identifying countermeasure.  Right now we're looking at things like aspirin and antioxidants.  Those are the first tier.  These are -- these are categories of drugs that have already been clinical proven on the ground for safety and efficacy and in clinical trials.  So there are FDA-approved drugs that you can use in case of these large accidental exposures for acute radiation syndrome.  And that's a tier two drug that we can also consider.  The third type of drug is drugs that are being investigated to mitigate radio toxicities after cancer therapy.  So in the clinic when people are getting radio therapy, they are going to experience heart disease later on in their life.  They're going to get secondary cancers from that radiation.  And there's a huge field NIH is currently funding to develop mitigators for those radio therapy-induced toxicities.   And the fourth is very specific to space radiation: Are there drugs that we can use to target mechanisms or pathways that are space radiation-specific versus gamma or X-ray radiation-specific?    Host:  These heavy ion ones?    Zarana Patel:  Mm-hmm.    Host:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, one thing was talking about -- we've talked a little bit about the effects, you know, cardiovascular things that are happening to the human body, and these interdisciplinary efforts.  You know, looking at not just radiation.  One of them you mentioned was cataracts and eye damage.  I know just from talking with a lot of other experts that there is a -- there is a challenge with vision problems in astronauts just from being exposed to, I guess, the microgravity environment.  There's this fluid shift that happens, and there's a lot of other factors that may contribute to this.  Now, radiation sounds like it's kind of an effect of its own.  What are we learning there of how these disciplines are crossing and affecting the eyes?    Zarana Patel:  The thing about cataracts and astronauts is that it's been long established as an effect of space radiation.  And it's actually the one biological effect we know and we can see and identify and point to as a space radiation effect in this small astronaut cohort.  They get it, we know it's from space radiation, and we know that we can mitigate it very easily.  It's a simple -- relatively simple surgery.    Host:  Surgery.    Zarana Patel:  So it is a known space radiation effect, but NASA quantifies it as a acceptable risk because the surgery for cataracts is fairly simple.  It also manifests later on in life.  And so it's not an in-mission risk.  So the thing with the SPANS risk, which stands for space flight-associated neuroocular syndrome, is that it's been only identified recently.  Now, there's still a lot of data to be collected from that.  They're not sure if it's caused by microgravity, if it's caused by fluid shifts, if it's caused by something else -- elevated intercranial pressure.  So the -- there may or may not be some kind of interacting with radiation as well.  We just don't know yet.    Host:  Yeah.  Now, one thing about being a scientist and, you know, you're working in the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory, trying to get data points to understand what is happening, we're looking forward to going beyond low-earth orbit new.  You know, we're talking about missions on the moon, missions to Mars.  Let's go to the moon for a second and let's assume we're in the middle of a long-duration stay on the moon; what scientifically from a radiation perspective and a biological perspective are you looking forward to?    Zarana Patel:  So a lot of the samples, the data we get from astronauts and crew involves blood samples.  And what we can gather from those samples is are there any chromosome aberrations within those samples?  What kind of DNA damage is happening?  So I think that is a, one, very useful tool.  We call it biodosimetry.  So it's a biological measure of the dissymmetry, the radiation dose that you're going to get.  I think the biodosimetry from a long-duration mission -- long-duration mission on the moon would be really useful.  We don't have that data yet.  Other things that would be interesting to look at are same thing in the blood samples, looking at biomarkers that are of interest for all four of our risks.  So cancer, CNS, and cardiovascular disease.  Other things that we could look at would be the cardiovascular morphology, doing an echocardiogram on the heart.  Or doing an MRI on the brain or even on the heart itself to look and see if there are early markers -- subclinical but early markers that we can use to identify potential downstream effects and mitigate them earlier.    Host:  Yeah, so a lot of data that we can get, really, and to help us understand the environment.  So can you tell us about some of the more recent studies that you've been doing for in terms of radiation, maybe in the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory?    Zarana Patel:  Yes.  We are planning -- so NSRL actually has three runs a year, spring, summer, and fall.  And this fall, 18C we're planning to do the first test of our GCR simulator.  So we're going to irradiate animals and test out this scheme that we have to simulate the space radiation GCR field.  We're going to irradiate them with -- six days a week we're going to irradiate them with this schema, these five ion beams because hydrogen and proton, and we're going to see what happens to these animals over varying lengths of time.  And in that way we hope to simulate a three-year Mars mission and the endpoints that we might see in the human cohort.    Host:  Hmm.  Okay.  So yeah it's coming up this fall.  Where -- where is it again?  Is it on -- here at NASA?    Zarana Patel:  Yeah, the Space Radiation Laboratory is housed at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  It's on Long Island.    Host:  Long Island?  Okay.  So you're going out to [inaudible].    Zarana Patel:  Yes [Laughs].  Yeah, they have a -- so Brookhaven National Labs has a very large linear accelerator.  And what they do is they pull off a little bit of the large beam and route it down to NASA Space Radiation Laboratory.  And that's a very simplified way of what's happening with all the aspects of it [Laughs].  But in that way that we can then sort of piggyback off the large lunar accelerator.    Host:  Yeah, it's not -- you know, when you say, \"Oh yeah, we have to simulate this galactic cosmic ray, this galactic cosmic background radiation\" that's not an easy thing, it doesn't sound like.    Zarana Patel:  No, it's not easy at all.  And as I said, this is probably the only facility in the worlds that is capable of doing it to date.    Host:  Wow.  Yeah, we were talking -- we were talking [Laughs] a little bit about everyone always asks us, you know, \"Where is your zero-G room?\"    Zarana Patel:  Yeah [Laughs].    Host:  [Laughs] Like we have a room where you can just sort of flip a switch and oh yeah, we're in microgravity.  It's so much more complicated than that when you get into it.    Zarana Patel:  Yeah, you have to take every ground analog with a grain of salt obviously.  But you also have to use what you can with the limitations of only being able to send a limited number of people for a limited number of times into space with a limited budget.    Host:  Yeah.  Now, I know there's a lot of ground analogs here.  There's -- you know, some are sort of simulating a Mars habitat.  You know, you're living in space, I guess, simulated for X number of days, whether it's, you know, HERA does 45-day missions now, there's the Mars 500, you got Antarctica.    Zarana Patel:  Yeah, things like HERA where they take a crew of three or four people and they isolate them in a similar vehicle type format for varying numbers of days, you know?  I think they started at, like, something like five days and now they're up to 45 days.  You can really get a feel for how does -- how do some of these other hazards like isolation and confinement affect the human?  And not just the human but their interactions with other humans.    Host:  Oh.  Is that [Laughs] -- this kind of goes back to that what's happening with the radiation and how it affects our mood; can you imagine if you're in this closed box with, you know, five other people on a journey to Mars and all of a sudden this radiation is making you [Laughs] antsy or anything like that?  That would be -- that would be unfortunate.    Zarana Patel:  Yeah, so the risk of radiation versus the risk of behavioral health and performance, it's going to be a really difficult issue.     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Zarana Patel:  For me, I got sucked into NASA very early on because I love to read.  And my brother sort of introduced me to sci-fi.  And in that moment I was hooked.  So I read all the sci-fi greats.  I read Asimov, Bradbury.  And for me it is really this long-term goal of manned space flight and exploration to the cosmos.     [ Multiple Speakers ]  That is worth the risk.    Host:  Yeah, there's still a lot to explore.  I mean, just recently, Scott Kelly spent a year in space more than any other NASA astronaut before him.  And that -- he gave us a good perspective of the [inaudible] missions and the time that we're I guess allowed or supposed to spend in space [inaudible].  Is there anything you know based on that study [inaudible] longer period of time in space will do from a radiation perspective?    Zarana Patel:  Yeah, there was a lot of discussion about how Scott, when he came back, the whole event changed his genes.  And I think it's important to note that his genes weren't actually changed.  Him and Mark are actually still twins [Laughs].  But what did change was the gene expression.  So what happens when you live for a year anywhere is that you have the environment that you're surrounded by change you and then sort of the nurture part of nature versus nurture.  So nature is genes [inaudible] change.  The nurture part is the environment [inaudible].  It did affect him.  So even if you spent a year of your life and you went on a diet or you had sleeping habits change, you had a baby or you changed jobs, you would experience epidemiologic change in that year of life.  So when he came back, actually, the level of change that we saw was fairly similar to something like a human might experience in a stressful environment, like if you went scuba diving or if you were climbing Mount Everest.   So nurture is the environment, and within the space radiation environment you've talked about these five hazards.  There's isolation, confinement, distance from Earth, radiation.  And the whole body outcome is that you're exposed to all five of these simultaneously.  And it's really difficult to say that one is responsible for these genetic expression changes in Scott.  You're not going to be able to tease that out based on one person.  He had a whole body response and it's similar to someone spending a year of their life in a stressful situation away from family.  But with the levels of -- actual levels of changes he saw within six months of returning to Earth, most of them went back to pre-flight levels but only 7% persisted to date.  So that means that 7% of the gene -- the ways that his genes are expressed is changed.  And that's considered fairly minimal.  Now, that's only a year on the ISS, which is a fairly low-dose radiation environment.   You know he's close to Earth.  There are return options.  With the three-year Mars missions, there's going to be increased risk.  But I think -- I think the risk for -- obviously the risk for these crew is worth it.  They are willing to go and do these things.  And it is hard, but I think we should enable them in every way we can.  I think that is the whole point of our Human Research Program.    Host:  Yeah.  A lot of the guests I talk to is there's so much that we don't -- that's, like, a big theme, is there's so much that we don't know.  So you got to have the bold astronauts that are willing to be, like -- you know, raise their hand and be like, \"I'll do it.  I'll be the person where you can study me and figure out what happens to me.  And that way we can understand what happens and more people can go.\"  Because I feel like a lot of people do want to go.  There's a lot of people already signing up.  They're like, \"Yeah, I'll go to Mars.\"  [Laughs]    Zarana Patel:  Yes, for sure.  Because the risk is worth it.  And if they're willing to take that risk, then we need to do our best to mitigate the risk for them.    Host:  And I'm glad that you're on the front lines, helping out from the radiation perspective.  Zarana, thank you so much for coming on and sharing this perspective of what happens to the human body in the radiation environment.  Thank you.    Zarana Patel:  You're welcome.  Thank you guys for this opportunity.    Host:  Of course.     [ Music ]    Host:  Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So today we talked with Dr. Zarana Patel about that first hazard, radiation.  So we have four more to go.  Do you want to see the overview again?  Again, the last episode that we did was with Dr. Mike Barrett.  And he went over all five hazards.  Otherwise you can go to NASA.gov/hrp.  We're working with the Human Research Program here at NASA to put these five episodes together for you.  And while we are releasing these episodes, you can go to that website and check out some of the products that they have that are associated with some of these topics.  So you can go there right now and check out some of the stuff they have on radiation.  Otherwise you can see what we're doing at the International Space Station realtime research going on at NASA.gov/iss.  And then, of course, the social media accounts on the NASA Johnson Space Center and the International Space Station.  Go to any one of those accounts.  Use the hashtag #AskNASA, mention Houston we have a platform and ask a question [Laughs].   Houston we have a platform -- Houston, We Have a Podcast on your favorite platform.  There it is.  And then [Laughs] ask a question and we'll put it on the podcast.  We've done it a bunch of times before and even made whole episodes out of it.  So this episode was recorded on June 29th, 2018.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, Pat Ryan, Bill Stafford, Bill Pulaski, Judy Hayes, Isidro Reyna, Mel Whiting, and Natalie Gogins.  And thanks again to the radiation expert, Zarana Patel, for coming on the show.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a birthday.  Welcome to the official award-winning podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center.  This is Houston, We Have a Podcast, and we just won the Silver Excalibur Award from the Public Relations Society of America just recently.  So yes, we're an award-winning podcast.  Thank you for joining us.  This is episode 52, our annual anniversary.  Because one year ago -- I guess tomorrow -- from the release of this podcast we just started with episode one of Houston, We Have a Podcast, and what a ride it's been.  So we've brought in so many different scientists, engineers, and astronauts to talk about a huge variety of topics and share their incredible stories.  So to celebrate a year of Houston, We Have a Podcast, I brought in the podcast team to go in front of the mics this time.  So today I'm talking with producer, audio engineer, and I like to call audio wizard, Alex Perryman.  And then we're also bringing in Dan Huot, who's been a guest, co-host, and a host for the show.   We'll talk about how the podcast got started and reflect on some of our favorite moments.  So if you're new to the show, this will give you a nice snapshot of some of the conversations we've had so far.  So with no further delay, let's go light speed once again and jump right ahead to our talk with the podcast team of Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Enjoy.     [ Music ]    Host: All right, guys.  It's been a year.    Alex Perryman:    Host: Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  We got a cake in the middle, it says Houston, we have a birthday.  You're welcome.    Alex Perryman: Thank you, thank you.  Since Dan's not going to say anything, thank you.    Dan Huot: I'm just -- I was just thinking, like, we were so close to starting the podcast on Alex Perryman scholastic achievement day, but we just missed it but, like, a week or so.    Alex Perryman: Yay.    Host: Wait is it -- oh, it was last week?    Alex Perryman: Yeah, it was June 12th.    Host: How did I miss that?  Was I away?    Dan Huot: It was on the work calendar.    Alex Perryman: No, you were here.    Host: I was here, but you thought I wasn't here.    Alex Perryman: Yeah.    Host: Okay, I'm sorry.  Happy work achievement day.    Alex Perryman: Thank you.    Host: I should know, I see you, like, multiple times a week.    Alex Perryman: Oh, yeah.    Host: Yeah, that would be cool.  Well, so today is the one-year anniversary.  One year ago tomorrow, I guess, by the time this releases it will be one year of Houston, We Have a Podcast.  I didn't think that that happened.  We were just kind of doing the podcast, and then next thing you know, a year goes by.  And so I thought this would be a perfect time to get all of us together, the guys that have been doing the podcast since the beginning, and just sort of reminisce and talk about the podcast.  End especially for new listeners this is a perfect opportunity to really get into some of the best moments and really -- if you're just tuning in, this is kind of the highlights, some of the moments that really got us started here.  But, you know, I always say, you know, thanks to producer Alex at the end of the movie or producer Alex, cue the music, you know?  But we don't know anything about producer Alex.  So let's start there.  Who is producer Alex?    Alex Perryman: Well, producer Alex is Alex Perryman.  I went to Full Sail University for audio engineering.  So I come from a music background.  So this is a little different for me.  But audio is audio [Laughs].    Dan Huot: I almost feel like we should caveat Alex has the coolest life ever, so strap in.    Alex Perryman: [Laughs] Yeah, the strap in.  It's not as extravagant as Dan is making it seem.    Dan Huot: Yea, now live up to that.    Alex Perryman: Gary Jordan: Yeah, yeah, thanks, no pressure here.  But I just -- you know, I have some pretty cool friends, know some cool people.    Host: Wow.  Okay, I won't just leave it.  Do you want to talk about who it is or you want to just leave it there and remain --    Alex Perryman: Well, I mean, I do know some Grammy-award winning producers and engineers in the music industry.  So it's kind of cool to have those as your Facebook friends so they can brag all day on Facebook about working with Beyonce here recently, which was what I saw.    Host: What?    Alex Perryman: And so -- yeah [Laughs].    Host: Man, you got the connections.    Alex Perryman: Oh, yeah.    Host: So wait, you were into music first, what kind of music were you doing?    Alex Perryman: Any kind.  It didn't really matter as long as it had a beat.    Host: That's really good music, then.    Alex Perryman: Yeah, there you go.    Host: All right.  So what's some of the favorite music that you've actually produced?    Alex Perryman: I do a lot of music for games personally.  So I love doing, like, gaming music and driving music.  Not the, you know, elevator music that will put you to sleep, but the music, like, \"Oh, I'm on a road trip.  It sounds like I'm on a road trip,\" that type of music.    Host: [Laughs] All right.  So Dan added that you have one of the coolest jobs ever; what is it that you're doing here, here at NASA?    Alex Perryman: So here at NASA, outside of being the audio wizard for the podcast, I work with the ISS on a lot of their live in-flight events.  I'm the voice that gets to talk to them at the end of the live event.  So I say my one awesome line and then I sign off.  But it's cool because it's heard in space.  So I get to go bed at night knowing that.    Host: Let's do it here, what's the line?    Alex Perryman: Station, this is Houston ACR.  That concludes the event.     [ Applause ]     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Dan Huot: Literally chills right now.  It might be because the room's 30 degrees.     [ Laughter ]    Host: That is the voice, that's awesome.  So you're constantly -- like, you're doing events, and your voice is in space.  And you have -- I mean, the audio control room, I've been there before, it's awesome.  It's so cool.    Alex Perryman: It's like a spaceship.    Host: It is, you're getting feeds from space all the time.  You actually get to communicate to and from -- well, to space, right?    Alex Perryman: Yeah.    Host: This concludes the event.  Right?    Alex Perryman: Yeah, I don't get to communicate from space.  That would be cool, though, if I could go up there and just end the event there, that would be nice.     [ Laughter ]    Host: Just float by the camera, right?    Alex Perryman:  Yeah.    Host: That concludes the event.  [Laughs] All right, Dan, you have been on the podcast.  You were the first guest I had.  We kind of sat down for episode one, and it wasn't -- actually, it wasn't planned to be episode one when we first did it.  It was, like, let's just see how podcasts could go.    Dan Huot: Yeah, we set bar low.    Host: [Laughs] And I was host and you were the guest.  And we talked about the International Space Station and just had a conversation.  And I think it's the most popular episode, I think, to this day.    Dan Huot: That sounds about right.  [Laughs] You know, I remember after we finished walking out and thinking, \"Man, that was so much fun.\"  Because at the end of the day our job is to talk about space.  And that was -- hey, Dan, sit in front of his microphone and talk about space for 45 minutes to an hour and don't shut up the entire time because that's what we actually want.  And that was fantastic.  It was such a blast to do.  And I still don't listen to too many podcasts, but I can tell you making them has been a lot of fun.    Host: Yeah.     [ Music ]  It has been described as one of the greatest engineering feats in human history.    Dan Huot: Not to toot our own horn, but we would certainly -- I would certainly argue that building a football-sized million-pound spacecraft in space is definitely up there.    Host: Yeah.     [ Music ]  Oh, yeah.  I listen to a ridiculous amount of podcasts.  That's actually how it got started, is I moved up to the city and my commute -- well, you know, my commute started when I was really close to here, in Clear Lake to NASA I was 15 minutes.  So that was --    Alex Perryman: Lucky.    Host: Yeah, just -- yeah, right?  Turn on the music or whatever.  It doesn't have to be anything -- I did listen to my own music, but it could be the radio because it's really, really short.  But when your commute goes up to an hour both ways, you know, you need to fill that time.  So I just started listening to podcasts because there's so many of them.  And obviously the first thing you do if you work at the Johnson Space Center is, like, what kind of space podcasts are out there?  So you start looking.  And NASA had a few, but they weren't, like, I don't know, podcasts, right?    Alex Perryman: They were more like shows just put in audio.    Host: Highlight shows almost.  So, like, two-minute recaps.  So I thought -- I was like, \"We should make one.\"  I think the only one at the time was NASA in Silicon Valley.  That was the only true podcast.  Everything else was just, like, highlights or they took space-to-ground and they just took the audio from it, the two-minute highlight show that we do every week.  And I was like, \"I bet you we could do this.\"  So I researched the industry and found out that lots of people listen to podcasts.  Who knew, right?  This industry is enormous.  It's been growing exponentially every single year.  So I thought it was almost prudent for us to enter into that space.  And here we are.  It took us a while to actually get off the ground just because we had to -- we had to build it from scratch and I had to figure out how to do a podcast, how to create weekly content, and how to make sure we did everything right.  Because NASA has a particular way of doing things.   We got to go out through NASA.gov versus any other sort of podcast feed or anything.  But yeah, so that's kind of how it --    Dan Huot: And we had to explain what a podcast was to a lot of people.    Host: Yeah, yeah, that was a huge part of it, was I had to research the industry and come up with statistic and present to management and say, \"We should do this.\"    Dan Huot: But then it was all the fun stuff.  What are we going to call it?  What is it going look like?    Host: [Laughs] What are we going to call it was fun.  Do you remember us coming up with the huge list of names?    Alex Perryman: Oh my gosh.    Host: It was enormous.  And it was actually Kelly Humphreys who came up with Houston, We Have a Podcast.  So props to him.    Dan Huot: Knocked it out of the park.    Host: Yeah.    Alex Perryman: [Multiple speakers] perfect.    Dan Huot: Because coming up with the name, it's almost like you hear it and you're like, \"Dibs, band name,\" because it's so hard to come up with something that just sounds almost natural.  You always do the test, like, \"Hey, did you listen to insert X hear last week?\"  And that was, I think, the first or really the only one that got pitched that it was like, \"Yep, that's it.\"    Host: That's the one [Laughs].    Dan Huot: Lock it down.    Host: Honestly, at that point there was no other options.    Dan Huot: No.    Host: It was just -- it was too perfect.    Dan Huot: Yeah.    Host: And originally to hear.  Well, actually, it was Houston, we've had a problem I think is the original quote.  But we couldn't say we've had a podcast because we have one.  We have one right now.     [ Laughter ]  So we had to do that.  All right, Dan, I want to know a little bit more about your background.  How did you get here to NASA?    Dan Huot: I was poor and I needed money.     [ Laughter ]    Alex Perryman: Join the club.    Dan Huot: No, so that is kind of the genesis of it.  I was in school, I was in college still and my roommate and I were sitting around.  And we had just gotten done with week three of eating hotdogs bought in bulk.  And we were like, \"We should probably try and make some money.\"  So we figured let's go get internships.  And so thankfully I went to school that had a really well-set up student employment program where -- a co-op program where I walked in and was immediately presented with a list of companies.  And they said, \"Pick which ones you want and you'll get an interview.\"  And I was like, \"Oh, that's easy.\"  And NASA was on the list.  And I was a business major in school.  So my first thought was, \"What the heck am I going to do at NASA?\"  I went to school with nothing but engineers.  So I was constantly reminded I am not an engineering.  And so then I saw this and I was like, \"Why would I go to NASA?\"  And they said, \"No, they're just like any other engineering company even where you still have business functions.  You can go do budget and contracts.\"   And that didn't sound super exciting, but it was NASA, so I said, \"Yeah, sign me up.\"  So I interviewed and I got the position.  So I came in as an intern, as a student, and I spent an entire semester in a budget office.  To put it lightly, it was not for me.  I knew that pretty quickly.  But since it was a co-op program that NASA still does -- name drop for the co-op program if you're a student; go apply because it's incredible -- you get to come back for multiple tours.  And they always told us try to get outside your comfort zone, see what else the center has to offer.  And I said, well, I always loved writing.  I liked talking.  Let me go see if I can go do public affairs.  That sounds like fun.  So they brought me in.  It was super intimidating.  They made me do a writing test and, you know, we need to see if you're up to snuff.  Pat's laughing at me.  [Laughs] But I passed.  And I got to come out, and I was a student.  And I mean, I came out, we were still flying Shuttle at the time.   And so I spent a summer in public affairs and it was during -- STS-125 was the first Shuttle mission that I vividly remember.  And that was -- Pat was probably doing commentary.  You were doing Orbit 2.  So that means Pat was one of the people in mission control, you know, giving live in on orbit 2.  So that was the exciting one probably when they were doing space walks and stuff.  So that mission was the last time we fixed Hubble.  And that was the last time we did space walks out of the Shuttle airlock.  So it was a really exciting mission.  There was a big IMAX movie that was made out of it.  I mean, it was incredible.  And that got me hooked.  And then I just kept coming back and refused to leave [Laughs].  And thankfully, they offered me a job by the time I graduated.  So it worked out.    Host: That's true.  That's one of the good things about the co-op program, right, as long as you do refuse to leave, you keep coming back --    Dan Huot: Chances are good.    Host: -- your chances are pretty good.    Dan Huot: That you might be here at NASA.    Alex Perryman: He's got to weigh them down a little bit, it's all right.     [ Laughter ]    Host: You know, that was actually -- that was my thing, too.  I started off as a business major myself.  And I knew pretty early I wanted to do marketing.  So I joined the marketing association.  And I loved films, so I was making a bunch of, like, commercials and stuff for the marketing association.  But I was having sort of a, I don't know, some moment where I was kind of second-guessing myself that maybe marketing wasn't for me.  And so I was thinking about switching to supply chain.  And the career fair was coming up for my sophomore year, and I decided not to go.  So I went to my morning classes.  And it was college, so I went to my morning classes and I was done by, like, 10:30 [Laughs].  I went to home and I changed and just sat on the couch.  And I was watching TV.    Alex Perryman: Very productive.    Host: Very productive, yeah.  I was a good student.    Dan Huot: Career fair, future?  Nah.  TV.    Host: Yeah, right.  And so two of my friend, Nick Penos [assumed spelling] and Chris Walton busted into my door, both suits, and they say, \"Gary, what are you doing?\"  [Laughs] And I go, \"Nothing.  That's what I'm doing.\"  And they said, \"Get your suit on, print out your resume, and come to the career fair.\"  And I was like, \"I don't really want to go.\"  And they said, \"But you're going.\"  And I said, \"Okay, fine.\"    Alex Perryman: Peer pressure.    Host: Yeah, right.  So I went to the career fair.  And they printed out my name, and it said business administration on it because I didn't even declare my major yet because I was only a sophomore.  I had my resume in hand and just everything that I was doing with the Penn State marketing association.  And I circled the career fair.  It was in the Bryce Jordan Center of Penn State, which is just a big -- it's their basketball stadium but it's a stadium and it was completely filled.  It was, like, one of the biggest career fairs.  So I just circled it and that took me an hour.  But I didn't see anything that really stuck out to me except for NASA.  Everything -- you know, because I was already second-guessing what I wanted to do.  But NASA had these banners that had, like, you know, people floating in the microgravity plane and working on robots.  And I was like, \"That looks cool.\"  And I was like, \"Well, I guess I'll just stand in line.\"  So I stood in line and so did a lot of other people.  And I was looking around at their badges and it said aerospace engineer, aerospace engineer, mechanical engineer, electrical engineer.  I'm like, \"I do not belong here.  What am I doing in this line?\"   And I was like, \"What do I have to lose?  I mean, I don't really want to interview with anyone else.\"  So I finally went up to the lady and I was just -- I mean, I had nothing to lose.  I was confident.  I said, \"Here's who I am, here's what I've done.  I make films.  I like marketing.  What do you have for me?\"  And they said, \"Oh, we have a public affairs office that we do -- you know, we make films and we broadcast live.  We write press releases and talk to the public and get them excited about space.\"  And I go, \"That looks fun.\"  So I came down here first semester, Public Affairs Office, sold.  Refused to leave.  Kept coming back [Laughs].  And here I am.  Yeah.    Dan Huot: So I would say shameless plug for Gary: He's responsible for one of the most viewed NASA videos of all time.    Host: Yes [Laughs].  That's right, NASA Johnson Style.     [ Music ]    Host:  NASA Johnson Style.    Host: That was my first co-op video project.  We just, I don't know -- Gangam Style was a hit at the time.  So we were like, \"We can make a parody of this.\"  And so yeah, we went through and I went behind the camera, directed it, edited it, and yeah, made it into this great, fun video.  And people are trying to beat the view count on that ever since.    Dan Huot: I just love we have people launching on rockets, gorgeous views of outer space, stuff you can't get anywhere else, but our best thing is NASA Johnson Style.  Which I think just speaks to the quality of that video, Gary.    Host: Thanks, Dan.  Thanks.  Yeah -- no that was --    Alex Perryman: You really know your audience.    Host: Yeah, I do.  That's what people -- give people what they want, you know?  It was good.  That was really fun.  I love making videos like that.  So that was my thing, as long as I can keep doing fun things.  And, you know, that was another reason I wanted to create the podcast is this is fun.  I get to sit down and have conversations with good people and then you guys, too [Laughs].    Alex Perryman: Thanks.    Dan Huot: Oh, feel the love right there.  My best to you guys.    Host: Yeah -- no, but just really -- I mean, astronauts, engineers.  I mean, just you hear these stories, and they get so passionate about what they're talking about.  And honestly, we can easily make this into a three, four, five-hour podcast episode, but it's just, you know, you got to think about who's listening.  But, I mean, it's just amazing to talk to these people.  So we already started with episode one.    Dan Huot: Well, clearly that was the best.    Host: Clearly that was the best.    Alex Perryman: That was the best.    Dan Huot: And it's been all downhill from there.     [ Laughter ]    Host: Yeah -- no, but that was good.  Because a fun thing about that episode is the first, I think, four minutes of the episode were cut.   Dan Huot: Was terrible.    Host: Because we didn't really know how to start a podcast.    Alex Perryman: Yeah.    Dan Huot: We tried to be witty.  We're not witty.    Host: Yeah, we tried to be witty and funny, and you're right, it was awful.  So yeah, the first three minutes are cut and we just got right into the good stuff there.  And then we went ever since.  It was pretty awesome.  The next episode was 2017 astronaut class.  I think we selected the class in June, first episode of the podcast came out in July.  So naturally it was just -- it was a hot topic at the time.  Brand new class, 12 new astronauts with great personalities.  And I got 20 minutes with them.  Twenty minutes with 12 astronauts.  So there was no way I was going to be able to interview them.  I mean, if you do the math, I don't even get two minutes with each one of them.  So I was like, \"Okay, I got to do something fun.\"  So we played two truths and a lie.  We played a game.    Alex Perryman: It was awesome.    Host: It was so fun.  And, you know, it was kind of a roll of the dice, too, because you have no idea how they're going to -- you know, they might engage, they might not.  But they were just a fantastic, fantastic group of people and engaged real fast.     [ Music ]    Robb Kulin:  All right.  So inspected a rocket booster while I had liquid oxygen on board.  Skied off the summit of Denali wearing a superman cape.  I went rock climbing with a broken ankle while wear an astronaut helmet.    Host:  Oh.    >> That was the second one?   Robb Kulin:  Skied off the summit of Denali wear a Superman cape.    >> I'll go with that one.    >> Yeah, I'd go with that.    Robb Kulin:  You guys are too easy.     [ Laughter ]    Host: So what kind of cape was it?    Robb Kulin:   That was the lie.    Host: What was the last one again?    Robb Kulin:  I went rock climbing with a broken ankle while wearing an astronaut helmet.    Host: Why?     [ Laughter ]    >> Why not?    Robb Kulin:  I didn't realize it was broken.  I just kept [inaudible].     [ Laughter ]    Robb Kulin:  So one of those padded astronaut helmets like you see in the costume store.  And my buddy's [inaudible] like we go climbing, having some sort of gag with you, whether it be some sort of silly costume, I guess.  And that day it was the astronaut helmet.     [ Music ]    Host: But I got to talk to Anne Roemer, too, on just the selection process and how difficult it is.  Because, you know, I think we in public affairs are partially responsible, but it was really -- it was a large effort.  But we really drove the application process really hard.  And [Laughs] the poor folks that had to go throughout application process --    Alex Perryman: I almost applied.    Host: Really?    Alex Perryman: Yeah, I was convinced.  I was like, \"I might can do this.\"     [ Laughter ]    Dan Huot: I think -- what was it -- 18,000 people applied, which was a record, and 12 got selected.    Host: Twelve.    Dan Huot: Which, when you look at the resumes for those 12 --    Host: It made sense.    Dan Huot: It makes a lot of sense.  [Laughs] It kind of makes you question what you've done with your life because they're just -- overachiever doesn't even start just because they've already done so much and now they're astronauts or now they're going to be restaurants.  It's -- it's insane.  So yeah, getting to play two truths and a lie with them -- that was a treat.    Host: I know.  That's funny.  Yeah, I mean, reading their resumes was insane because we did get to -- and Me and You Shared This was actually interviewing them on Skype before they came.  They were all stationed.  They haven't come to the Johnson Space Center yet to begin all the event.  But we were interviewing them, and it was just fantastic to read through their resumes.  And here I am telling stories about me sitting on the couch and not going to a career fair.  And I'm reading these guys and I'm like, \"My gosh, I really need to go back to school.\"    Dan Huot: That was so much fun, though.  That wasn't a podcast thing.  But as a random aside that was really cool because we got to talk to these people right after they got a phone call everybody wishes they could get in their life.  Like hey, \"Want to come be an astronaut?\"     [ Laughter ]  Let me think about it, no -- yes.  And so we got to talk to those people, you know, within days or a week of them finding out.  That was -- you could feel the emotion.    Alex Perryman: It was nice.  Like, you're smiling, they're smiling.  Everyone's just happy.    Dan Huot: Yeah, we're all just so happy together.     [ Laughter ]  Yeah.    Host: It was really exciting.  And it was well-timed, too.  That was the very next episode, actually, was good timing.  Shane Kimbrough came back.  He had just landed from space.  He flew back and was here the very next day.  And then the very next day after that, I got to interview him about how that landing experience -- so it was, like, as fresh as you could possibly make it for Here and Houston, like, we got to hear him talking about coming down from space.  And I was -- I only got ten minutes, but man, it was --    Alex Perryman: It was a nice ten minutes.    Host: It was, it was really good.     [ Music ]    Shane Kimbrough:  Oh yeah.  No doubt.    Host: How did that feel?    Shane Kimbrough:   I've heard it called, like, a really bad car crash, and now I can confirm that that is accurate.    Host: Wow.    Shane Kimbrough:   So you hit just really hard.  In our case we hit twice really hard.    Host: Oh.  And then you rolled around?    Shane Kimbrough:   And then we rolled some more, too, just for added effects.     [ Music ]    Host: I just -- I felt bad because I had, like, a script of questions that I needed to ask him.    Alex Perryman: You asked him about food.    Host: I asked him about food, of course.  But I forgot to ask him how he was feeling until the very end of my questioning.  I was like, \"Oh my gosh, that should be question number one: Man, how are you doing?  You just came back from space, are you feeling good?\"  But he was, he was talking about he was already back at the gym day two, you know?  Already back and starting to recondition himself.  So just to hear what these guys do.  And, again, I'm on the couch.  You know?  Just saying.  How about you guys?  I mean, I'm just going through episodes one through three, but do you guys have a favorite episode?    Dan Huot: Live from Space.    Host: Oh my -- how did [Laughs].    Dan Huot: We're not all is equally blessed as Alex to where we get to talk to space all the time.  It's kind of a rare occurrence for the rest of humanity.  And so when we got to talk to Jack Fischer, who -- my all-time favorite astronaut --    Alex Perryman: Yeah, that guy's awesome.    Dan Huot: -- we got to talk to him in space, that was pretty surreal.    Host: That was.  And that one was -- we did it live.  The whole thing was live.  We did a video.  So we actually get to see -- we had a special set for the podcast.  And, you know, we had this open air where me and you were kind of telling stories about who he is, and you told the stories the first time you met.  It's just, like, we know he's going to be engaging because he's just in the past has just been incredibly fun to listen to and he comes up with crazy stuff.  And right up front he goes, \"By the way, for every question you ask me, I'm going to switch walls.\"    Alex Perryman: Yeah.    Host: And so if you take snapshots from that episode, every single snapshot will probably be him on a different position, wall, orientation.    Alex Perryman: Just bouncing around like Spiderman.  It was awesome.    Host: It was so fun.     [ Music ]    Jack Fischer:  It's awesome like it is every day.  And what I was going to do just because, you know, it is your first guest from space, every single question I'm going to go on a different, you know, wall.  So I'll be on the walls, I'll be on the ceiling.  I'm going to -- I'm going to adjust orientation mid-interview at every question just because I can and it's cool.     [ Music ]    Host: We got to do it again -- not with you the next time, Dan, but we did it with Megan Sumner and I got to talk to four astronauts.  And that was --    Alex Perryman: Yeah, photography, right?    Host: About photography.  And it was great because all of them were really passionate about that stuff.    Alex Perryman: Oh, yeah.    Host: Paolo Nespoli actually took the red camera and pointed it outside and he was talking about taking 4K footage of the Earth, which we obviously love.  And then they actually took [Laughs] -- pulled out camera and started taking snapshots just randomly of the event.  But it was just awesome.  They were all fully engaged, all four of them.  It was -- yeah, it was Nespoli, Mark Vande Hei, Joe Acaba, and Randy Bresnik.     [ Music ]    Paolo Nespoli: Yes, so we do have -- for still photography, we essentially have a Nikon camera.  Right now we have several D4.  Each one of us gets his own, plus we have a couple placed strategically.  Some of them are dedicate for special photography like macrophotography.  We need to do a lot of macrophotography for equipment here.     [ Music ]    Alex Perryman: That episode that I really liked was Rocket on a Rocket.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Alex Perryman: Like, I feel like if there's ever an episode that I can quote to people to make myself feel as smart as other people feel that I need to be since I work at NASA, a Rocket on a Rocket is my go-to episode.  Because that's where things clicked like, from, like, you know, the catchy -- oh, it's a rocket on a rocket.  Really, we're talking about launch/abort system.  I was like, \"Oh my gosh, I get it.  I get it.  I can make [inaudible] references, I'm smart.\"    Host: Yeah [Laughs].    Alex Perryman: I love that episode.    Host: Wahab was such a great guest, too.  Because I asked him up front during the podcast, I said, \"You know, I want to call this a rocket on a rocket.\"  I was like, \"Is that fair, is that accurate?\"  He's like, \"You know, when I saw that, when you sent the script to me,\" he's like, \"I thought about it and yes, absolutely.  It is definitely a rocket on a rocket.\"  But it's just so funny because it's, like, his world.  But I don't think he would have called it a rocket on a rocket.  You know, he thinks about the launch/abort.  He's into the intricate details.  But if you pull back, yes, if you're launching on a rocket, this is something that is a rocket that will launch, like, from a speeding rocket.  It's crazy.  That one is -- it was definitely one of my favorite conversations, too because he did such a good job of describing of, like, how it all works.  And you're right.    Alex Perryman: I think that's the reason why it clicked with me so much.  And so I'm, like, walking around, I hear people talking about him like, \"Oh, you're talking about a Rocket on a Rocket?\"  And they're like what?  And I was like, \"Oh, no.  It's fine.\"  I'm right.  It's fine.    Host: Oh, yeah.     [ Music ]    Wahab Alshahin:  When you told me that you were trying to call it a rocket on a rocket, I thought about that, and then I thought about the specifications for what this thing actually does.    Host: Yeah.    Wahab Alshahin:   It's 30 feet tall, it produces 400,000 pounds-plus of thrust.  That is basically -- at that point, yes, that is a rocket that is sitting on top of an even larger rocket.  Yeah.  So certainly that's a fair assessment.     [ Music ]    Host: I think when we first started this, I was kind of -- I was kind of up in the air of how popular it was going to get, you know?  How many people are going to listen to this?  But it just so happened that, you know, like you said, July is when it first came out.  August was when the total eclipse over America --    Alex Perryman: Oh yeah.    Host: -- was coming across.  And that was such a huge event for NASA.  For those of you who don't know, I mean, the total solar eclipse went across the United States and only across the United States, right?  It was only in totality within US territory.  And, like, we just blew it up, right?  We turned it into this huge event.  We went across the country and just sort of did live coverage.  NASA.gov exploded in terms of viewership.  Unmatched viewership.  Like, we totally shattered any record of NASA.gov traffic before that.  It just so happened that Houston, We Have a Podcast was -- had a total solar eclipse episode that was on the front page of NASA.gov whenever the total solar eclipse was coming.  So that gave us a real nice boost.    Alex Perryman: Oh, yeah.    Host: And that was a good conversation, too.  I mean, he was an eclipse expert and came with this huge binder of material.  Do you remember that?    Alex Perryman: Yes.    Host: And he -- like, he actually had a setup right here.  But he turned to the side from the microphone and we gave him another table, and he spread out all of this information because he had so much he wanted to go over.  I barely got a question in because he was like, \"And the next thing I wanted to tell you.\"    Dan Huot: He was prepared.    Host: He was.  That was great.    Alex Perryman: But it was filled with really, really good information, especially the safety information, which was really nice.  I remember friends that listened to that, they were that saying oh, they didn't know they can't just go out there and look at it in normal sunglasses.  It's probably not a good idea.  But listening to the podcast, they can.     [ Music ]    Host: All it.  Let's do it.  However you want to start.    Mark Matney:  Let's talk about safety a little bit.    Host: Okay, safety.    Mark Matney:  Everybody has heard don't look at an eclipse, you'll go blind, right?  We've all heard that.    Host: Yeah.    Mark Matney:  And I remember as a boy puzzling and puzzling over that.  What is it about an eclipse that makes it so dangerous?  Well, is turns out you don't want to stare at the sun ever.     [ Music ]    Dan Huot: Did you guys actually get to see the eclipse, though?  Or were you here in Houston?    Host: I was here in Houston, so I only saw part of it.    Alex Perryman: Yeah, I stepped out and I was just like okay.  Because we had -- I had -- we were live.  We were live on air.    Host: You went out, though, didn't you?    Dan Huot: I did.    Host: How was it?    Dan Huot: I abandoned my fellow NASA colleagues and I went to [inaudible].  So I think Houston was about 70% or so?    Alex Perryman: Yeah, it was pretty decent.    Dan Huot: It looked like -- well, you say that, but you're wrong.     [ Laughter ]  Because it probably got a little bit shady or something maybe.    Host: Actually, no the sky -- I mean, if you really paid attention maybe.  But, like, it looked pretty much the same.    Alex Perryman: I only saw it for, like, 20 seconds and I had to run back upstairs.    Host: Well, I put on my glasses and I could tell.  But, like, you know, the sky kind of looked the same to me.    Dan Huot: So I went on a trip to the middle of nowhere in Kentucky.  And this is going to be kind of a long aside, but I think it's worth it because if you have the chance to see a total solar eclipse, drop what you're doing and go somewhere where you can watch it.  Because, I mean, I've seen rocket launches, I've seen Soyuz landings, you know, all this crazy stuff -- that was one of the coolest things I've ever seen in my entire life.    Host: Wow.    Dan Huot: I went with a group of friends out to the middle of nowhere.  I got a bunch of really nerdy friends who calculated, you know, exactly where it will have the longest viewing point and they narrowed it down using maps to this cornfield in this, you know, very small town in Kentucky.  And we showed up and a guy had already rented out a farmer's cornfield, gave the farmer $1,000 and didn't let anybody else come on the cornfield with him.  So we were right across the street in somebody's front yard.  But it's this really surreal experience where it -- colors start to change all around you.  And this is -- it gets a little bit darker and a little bit darker.  And there's this moment where all of the bugs -- you didn't realize but there's bugs and there's just noise and everything -- it all just went completely silent.  And it was totally eerie and kind of freaky.  And then when it actually goes into totality and you can finally take the glasses off and just stare at the sun safely, it's -- it's weird.   It's weird.  It's really hard to describe, but it's -- it's a totally cool moment.  It's a primal moment where you almost automatically start thinking, you know, what did people hundreds and thousands of years ago that this happened, look up at the sky and think the world was ending?  Because you almost get that feeling.  Like, this should not be happening.     [ Laughter ]  And then it lasts a couple of minutes.  And then it's done.  And we have another one coming up in 2024, I think?    Host: Yeah.    Alex Perryman: That's going to actually come through Houston, isn't it?    Host: I think it's more Austin, San Antonio.    Dan Huot: It will come through Texas, but it will come across the US again.  So anybody listening, start making plans for 2024.  Go out and see the total solar eclipse, you will not regret it.    Host: And I think that one's suppose to be longer totality.  I think yours was only, like, two minutes; I think this one's, like, four -- close to four or something.    Dan Huot: So it will be twice as cool.    Host: Yeah, yeah.  That just sounds surreal.  I think that was one of the stories was, like, two armies were, like, about to battle, and then a total solar -- this is, like, hundreds of years ago.  I'm going to butcher this story, by the way, because I don't really know all the details.    Dan Huot: Just start making up random fantastical stuff.    Host: Yeah.  But so total solar eclipse happened.  And they kind of looked up, the total solar eclipse passed, and they canceled the battle.  Like, \"Oh, that's a sign.  We're not going to fight today.\"  I wish I knew more information about that story.  But yeah -- no, it sounds surreal.    Dan Huot: This story brought to you by Garypedia.    Host: Yeah [Laughs].    Alex Perryman: I love it.    Host: So the very next -- the very next one after eclipse, this one was fun, was when Styx came.    Alex Perryman: Oh, yeah.    Host: Yeah.  They were on tour and they had a free day.  So we coordinated to bring them here on site.  And I helped out with the tour just like we do for many VIP tours.  But they actually sat down and we had a conversation.  And that was definitely one of my favorite conversations.  Because we just brought two members of Styx and then two I'll call them exploration experts.  Like, they actually study what it takes to go explore the cosmos.  And we talked about just that, you know?  So if we were to land on Mars, what kind of things will we need or the -- Styx was asking questions.  They were fully engaged.  We were talking about going to Mars, we talked about going out to Pluto and selfishly to the moon of Pluto, Styx.  You know?  Like, what would that even look like?  Just like these -- these kind of weird concepts of yeah, so if we did go out to the sort of Kuiper Belt are, like, what would a human mission kind of look like?   The answer would be very difficult.  But yeah, we had the experts there and actually had a fantastic conversation.    Alex Perryman: I ended up getting a guitar pick --    Host: Really?    Alex Perryman: -- as a gift.  And that was exciting.  I still have it.     [ Laughter ]    Host: Really?  That's so great.  Yeah, that was -- that was definitely one of my favorite episode for sure.  Because we sat -- it was different because we have -- right now we're kind of in a -- it's the three of us, right?  And we have this circular stables we have mics at three of us.  But this one we just sort of sat and you set up some booms, like, around.  And we just sat in a circle.    Alex Perryman: It was six people.    Host: Yeah, six people, right?  And we sat in a circle and just had a conversation.  And it was awesome.  We got another one coming up soon here where we're going to do that again.  But yeah, I mean, I love that kind of -- where everyone can just chime in.  Because you can tell it was kind of a rocky start because everyone's just kind of like, \"What is this going to look like?\"  And then eventually I couldn't get anyone to shut up, you know?  So it was great.     [ Music ]     [ Inaudible ]    Tommy Shaw:  If you were going to vacation and you were in the area, you'd go to Pluto and you'd take some snapshots.    Host: Yeah, see it from the surface.    Lawrence Gowan:  I don't know, I think with a little work, we could buff it up and make it a holiday destination.    Tommy Shaw:  It's a fixer-upper.  There's no doubt about it.    Lawrence Gowan:  Handyman's dream.    John Connolly:  It's about the size of downtown, Chicago, by the way.    Lawrence Gowan:  Is it?    Glenn Lutz: Yeah, it's not too big.    John Connolly:  Yeah, it's not that big.    Lawrence Gowan:  Chicago's nice.  [Laughs]    John Connolly:  Yeah, yeah.    Glenn Lutz:  A frozen Chicago.     [ Multiple Speakers ]     [ Music ]    Dan Huot: Did you guys do an episode during Harvey?    Alex Perryman: Gary did, yeah.    Host: So [Laughs] it was funny -- well, I wouldn't say funny because I couldn't get here.    Alex Perryman: Yeah.  Me, either.  I was in Dallas.    Host: Yeah, NASA was straight up closed.  And I live right off of Buffalo Bayou.  So when Harvey hit, it's kind of this river and all the floodgates dump into this river.  And so the floodgates got filled up.  So they let them loose on Buffalo Bayou.  And the whole thing flooded to levels I've never seen.  It's flooded once before since I've lived there, but not to this level.  And so the road that I usually take to get to NASA was completely under water.  So I wasn't going anywhere.  At that time, I mean, it wasn't long that we had started the podcast.  It was only, like, two months or something.  But was like -- I think it's appropriate to say something about it because just to acknowledge that this is happening.  So a couple days afterwards the levels started going down and people were kind of all over the streets just checking out the area because everything had been under water for two, three straight days.  And so I just kind of recorded, like, an update, just like, \"Here's what happened, guys.  A lot of things happened.  People lost their lives within Houston.   And, you know, a lot of people were affected, especially, you know, homes in one way or another,\" and just sort of just acknowledge that.  But I went out with a -- I had a portable audio recorder, my own personal one.  And I just recorded -- I wrote a script and printed out an update.  I mean, it was really hard to work, you know?    Alex Perryman: Yeah.    Host: Just because everyone was out of commission pretty much.  But I figured this was the right thing to do.  So I actually walked across the bridge to Buffalo Bayou and I recorded it on the bridge.  I was right -- and the water was right underneath me.  And the sidewalks -- where it was supposed to be the sidewalks were completely under water right next to me but I was on the bridge.  And I recorded it right there on Buffalo Bayou, so I recorded it outside.  But it was just, like, a two-minute update.  But I could successfully say that we never missed a week.    Alex Perryman: We did not, not even for a hurricane.    Host: That's right, we never missed a week.  That was crazy.     [ Music ]    Host: But if there's one good thing that came out of this disaster, it's learning that Houston is full of some incredible people and spaceship Earth is not such a bad place to live.  Local first responders and Coast Guard were helping those in need, and even Texas civilians grabbed their trucks and boats to aid in these efforts.  At NASA's Johnson Space Center's flight controllers braved the weather and camped out in mission control 24/7 to made sure the crew members aboard the International Space Station were safe and well.     [ Music ]  I think another thing was, you know, we had a lot of the changes just throughout the whole -- the whole time that we were here for a year.  We had -- first we were in Studio B, remember that?    Alex Perryman: Yes, the other studio.    Host: And the podcast setup was interesting.    Dan Huot: Where it was warmer.    Alex Perryman: It was warmer, but it was louder.    Host: But, you know, because we had never started a podcast before, we had very limited equipment.  We have these mics.  But actually, I can see the table right now.  It's this really small wooden table.  And we just clamped the mics to the side of that table.  There's barely enough room for two pieces of paper.  And we had our conversations in the back of Studio B because it was next to some sound buffers or something.  But I think we did a couple episodes there and they turned out okay, but the fan --    Alex Perryman: It just got ridiculous.    Host: Yeah, it got ridiculous.    Alex Perryman: The summer and it was trying to cool everything off.    Host: Yeah, I mean, it started getting a little bit annoying.    Alex Perryman:  It would just kick on randomly and it's like, \"Well, I hope we're done with this episode.\"     [ Laughter ]    Host: So that's -- that's when we went so the sound booth.    Alex Perryman: Yeah, it was a little bit warmer, cozy.    Dan Huot: Cozy's the operative word.    Host: You did a couple in there.    Dan Huot: Yeah, I did a couple in there, which I didn't mind it too much.  But I don't know if it's just me, but you almost start to get uncomfortable when you're in a sound booth after a while.    Alex Perryman: Yeah, it's just -- because it's totally quiet.    Dan Huot: It's too quiet.    Host: Yeah.  I mean, the levels are great, but the way our sound booth is situated, you got this big desk at the corner, right?  And we have interpreters sit there and they're looking at the screen And they have all their papers out.  It makes sense.  But for a conversation where you have to turn your head for the whole -- I mean, the mic is over here, you have to turn your head, I mean, the sound was bouncing everywhere.    Alex Perryman: There's a giant window.    Host: It was already pretty tight.  So now we're doing it in Studio A. And I want to bigger table.  This is a nice table right higher.    Alex Perryman: We're getting there.  We're slowly moving up.  It's a little cold in here, but it will even out.    Host: That's why for all of our guest now whenever we invite them, I'm like, \"Bring a jacket.\"     [ Laughter ]    Dan Huot: Trust me.    Host: But it's July.  I was like, \"Bring a jacket.\"    Alex Perryman: You'll want a jacket.  And you'll want July heat when you leave out of here.    Host: Oh.  Dan, do you have any guests that sort of stick out whenever you think about the folks that you've actually sat down and you've interviewed?    Dan Huot: A couple.    Host: Yeah?    Dan Huot: Probably the three most recent ones -- well, three of the most recent ones that I did which were in the booth.  I got to talk to Drew and Ricky before their flights.  And those were really cool.  Drew has this crazy, elaborate, reaching back to the early 1900 story of how he got to where he got.  And that was really cool to hear.  And then Ricky Arnold has taught in schools all over the planet and just shared his experience of what it was like getting off the plane for the first time in Morocco as a 20-something and just being --    Alex Perryman: Yeah, international band.    Dan Huot: Yeah, totally fish out of water in all these different places.  It's always cool to talk to an astronaut.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Dan Huot: Because they all have these super diverse, super unique backgrounds.  They'll have some of the same resume things, like, a lot of them are pilots or something.  But just the path that they took to become that is always unique.  And it kind of helps you realize, you know, no matter where you're starting, this is where you can end up.    Host: Yeah.    Alex Perryman: Right.    Dan Huot: The other one I really liked was I talked to Scott Smith, the nutritionist.  And as somebody who as horrendous diet [Laughs] you never really think about just all of the different aspects of your health that what -- the food that you're putting into your body can affect.  And just the level of what they're tracking for the astronauts in space is unreal, that they're able to track all of these individual aspects of the food just to keep the crew members healthy.  And then the stuff he was talking about for the vision changes is really cool.  Because vision changes, for anybody that kind of follows along, that's one of the big kind of gremlins out there for what happens to humans in space that we have to solve before we, you know, send people on to Mars for three years.  And there's a lot of theories out there about why it's happening, but they've actually been finding this genetic reason that could potentially, you know, give us an advance warning that hey, you might be susceptible to this.   And it will have effects for people here on Earth because it's linked to another disease.  And all this crazy stuff.  And coming in, like, his title is he's a bio -- bio what is it?  Biochemical nutritionist or something.    Host: Yeah, yeah.    Dan Huot: Something of that nature.  You wouldn't normally expect from the title to sit there and learn about that, but that's what he's working on.    Host: Right.    Dan Huot: And that was eye-opening.    [00:47:40] [ Music ]    Scott Smith:  Changes in some of their hormones.  There's a list of about eight or nine things that we had that we found a clinical population that had the exact same set of characteristics.  And that is women with polycystic ovary syndrome.    Dan Huot: Really?    Scott Smith:  Really.  Polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS as they call it is the leading cause of infertility in women.  It affects 10% to 20% of women which is a staggering incidence.     [ Music ]    Dan Huot: I'm jealous, though, you got to talk to Ginger.    Alex Perryman: Ginger is awesome.    Dan Huot: And Ginger is one of the coolest people on the face of the planet.    Host: You know, I mean, it would be a totally different story, but Alex and I were talking afterwards after we recorded that episode.  That was part of the Women's History Month episodes.  She was one of our four guests.  And I kind of wish we just -- the podcast, her segment was the 20 minutes, 25 minutes we spent after the podcast.    Alex Perryman: Yes.    Host: She was just -- first of all, her story -- I wish I included both, how about that?  Because her story was just incredible.  Just a roller coaster of emotion and start to finish, just incredible.  But oh yeah, afterwards it was so great because we put down -- we turned off the recording, right?    Alex Perryman: Yeah.    Host: And Ginger had actually attended because I say it's cold, but it's an audio podcast.  I was like, \"There's no specific attire.\"  She came in gym clothes.    Alex Perryman: Yeah.  She went straight to gym afterwards.    Host: She's like, \"I'm going to the gym right after this.  So this makes the most sense.\"  But we were just chatting and we were talking about -- like, she got an email notification while we were chatting, right?  And it was for a concert that was coming up.  And she's like, \"I really want to go to this concert.\"  And so she start texting her friend, \"Do you want to go with me?\"  And next thing you know, she's pulling up and she's buying tickets, right?    Alex Perryman: Yes.    Host: And then she's like, \"Have you heard of this artist before?\"  Like, I don't think -- and she's like, \"Oh, I love it.\"  And then she puts down her phone and we just start jamming for a couple minutes.    Alex Perryman: It's the best.    Host: It was great.    Alex Perryman: I was so mad I turned the recorder off.  I was like, \"I can't believe I did that.\"  I never turn it off when, like, normally I just keep it rolling and it's like I'll have buffer room at the end.  But I cut it off, and I don't know what I was thinking.    Dan Huot: Yeah.  She's one of the most, like, objectively cool people that you'll ever meet in your life.  But she's also insanely driven, insanely intelligent.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Dan Huot: And capable and was a flight director and all this crazy stuff.    Host: Yeah.    Dan Huot: And then she could sit there and introduce you to cool new bands.    Host: Yeah [Laughs].  Just super personable.  But yeah, her story was great.  And she never gave up.  She always just pushed forward.  It was an amazing story to hear.    Dan Huot: Go listen to Ginger's episode.    Host: Yeah.  That one was good, Stories of Her Strength is the name of the episode.    Alex Perryman:  Yes.     [ Music ]    Host:  Was it this goal that you had in the back of your mind that really helped you to kind of excel?  Because you graduated in the second of your class in high school, right?    Ginger Kerrick:   Yes, yes.  By one one thousandth of a point, not that I carry that with me to this day.  But --     [ Music ]    Host: You know, you were talking about Scott Smith, how -- you know, just learning his perspective and you're thinking about your own diet whenever you're thinking about nutrition.  And that was the same thing that happened whenever we had Andrea Hanson in here to talk about exercise.  That was a good one.  She talked about what the astronauts have to do to exercise and why they exercise, really to mitigate some of the bone and muscle loss that they have.  But I asked her, I was like, \"What do you take out of this?  Being a person, an expert, what are you taking out of this?\"  And she goes, \"Actually, because the folks on the ground are helping the astronauts so much, I have actually -- I actually have my own personal trainer because I realize how important that is.\"  It was an interesting perspective.  Because I was like, \"Huh, I wouldn't have thought that.\"  I thought it would have been a technique or a routine.  But it's, like, the whole personal trainer aspect.  She's like, \"I get that now.\"    Alex Perryman: That makes sense.    Host: Yeah, that makes sense to me.     [ Music ]    Andrea Hanson:  And so one thing I've taken away is I do hire a trainer to help me work out so that I'm make sure that I'm pushing myself and somebody's there to help keep me motivated along the way.     [ Music ]    Host: Poor Andrea, though, because that was the one where Greg -- oh my gosh.    Alex Perryman: The one time I take a vacation.    Host: Yeah, Alex took a vacation.  Where were you going?  You were actually speaking.    Alex Perryman: I was speaking at Full Sail University.  So I was -- I was down there for Hall of Fame Week.  And I got a lovely email from Greg [Laughs] explaining to me don't panic, I've handled it, but we're going to have to rerecord this podcast [inaudible].  We don't do that.  I mean, it's not live, but we get one take.    Host: But yeah -- no, that was -- the file came in corrupt the way that it was recorded.  That was another one we did in the sound booth.  And I felt so bad.  I was like, \"Andrea,\" I was like, \"You did a great job.\"    Alex Perryman: The odds of that happening are so slim.    Host: I know.    Dan Huot: You did so great, now come do it again.     [ Laughter ]    Host: So we had to rerecord the whole thing.  And she had no problems at all.  She was like, \"I understand, absolutely, thank you for coming.\"  She was really, really cool about it.    Alex Perryman: That's awesome.    Host: But that's not the only time that we've had a close call.  While that one was not even a close call, Greg just --    Dan Huot: That was a call.    Host: That was a call.    Alex Perryman: It was a call.  Close call was episodes being deleted that weren't released yet, close call.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Alex Perryman: That was --    Dan Huot: Who did that?  Gary.    Alex Perryman: Gary's like, \"Don't look at me.\"    Host: Don't look at me, I don't touch that.  Although I did have to record one episode.  I'll get to that after this story.    Alex Perryman: But yeah, so John was using our recorder for something.  And he reformatted the recorder.  I didn't know that he was going to reformat the recorder because we had just recorded an episode the day before and he wanted to use the recorder the next morning.  And I was like, \"Oh, that's fine.  I'll just pull the episodes off.\"  He's just going to record something.  I marked my numbers, I know where it's at.  I get the recorder back and I'm, like, \"Hey, John, did you pull everything?  Because there's nothing on it.\"  He's like, \"No, no, I reformatted it.\"  I was like, \"Oh.  Oh no.\"    Dan Huot: Oh, no.    Alex Perryman: And so I went panicking and it was -- I think it was, like, game two of NBA playoffs.  Throughout the entire game I literally have the recorder to some program trying to recover files.  And it took the entire game -- the entire Rockets game for it to find the files.  And it found them and I got the files back.  I'm still amazed that it happened.  I'm pretty sure that's where audio wizard comes from because that was pure magic.    Host: Yep, that is where it comes from.    Alex Perryman: The fact that every single file that we've ever record on there came back.  And that's hundreds of files.  And so I'm just, you know, I'm glad that software was there.  I would never like to go through that experience again.  I didn't know how to tell Gary.  Like, I was just sitting there because we recorded another episode, and I didn't want to tell him before the episode.  So I'm just sitting there look at him like, \"I am so sorry.\"    Dan Huot: Great job.  By the way, everything you did last week is completely gone.  Bye.    Host: Okay, bye.  Yeah, right?    Alex Perryman: I was like, \"Don't worry, I got a plan.  Hopefully this will work.\"    Host: Oh, actually, I don't think you told me until after you recovered them.    Alex Perryman: Yeah, that's right.  I did not tell him until after I recovered it.    Host: That was a smart move to do.    Alex Perryman: I just waited.  I was like, \"But I have the files now.  Don't worry [Laughs].\"    Host: That was the strategy I did with my mom whenever I went skydiving the first time.    Alex Perryman: There you go.    Host: I went skydiving, I went on the ground, and then I called my mom.  I was like, \"Mom, I went skydiving.\"  She's like, \"You did what?\"     [ Laughter ]  I was like, \"But I'm on the ground now, so you can't yell at me.\"  She's like, \"Oh, but I will.\"     [ Multiple Speakers ]  Some of the other folks that we have now.  So first of all, the shout-out to -- even though Greg lost that episode [Laughs] shout out --    Dan Huot: Not holding any grudges.    Host: Yeah, not holding any grudges, I definitely have forgiven him.  But he made the music for Houston, We Have a Podcast.  And that's great music.  The intro stuff?    Dan Huot: Oh, yeah.    Host: With the splashes of actual historical audio from missions -- really, really cool.  One small step for man, you know, he's got all that in there.  It's great.  Matt McKenzie, who actually was an intern for me back, oh my gosh, I think almost two years ago at this point.    Alex Perryman: Yes.    Host: It was two years ago.  Made the thumbnail.  So I'd like to thank him for that for sure.  And, you know, you were talking to Pat earlier.  Pat's off here to the side.  He's one of our new producers for Houston, We Have a Podcast, as well as Bill Stafford, who actually does all of the posting and --    Dan Huot: Click, click, click.    Host: Yeah, all that clicking.    Dan Huot: Taking awkward pictures of us [Laughs].    Host: So I'd like to thank them for joining the team.  Because for the longest time, I mean, Alex, it was pretty much just me and you just kind of running the show.    Alex Perryman: Yep.    Host: That was -- that was tough.  But yeah, here we are, 52 episodes later and a lot more to come.    Dan Huot: Pretty soon we'll get Pat to host one.    Host: That's right, the golden voice.    Dan Huot: Get that golden radio voice.    Host: Golden radio voice.    Dan Huot: Back out on the airwaves where it belongs.    Host: Yeah.     [ Laughter ]    >> Thank you.     [ Laughter ]    Host: Golden voice, everybody.  All right.  I'm going to open this.  It's probably going to make a lot of noise.  While we're doing that, I wanted to tell everyone that a lot of the episodes that we did throughout our 52 episodes were suggestions from you.    Alex Perryman: Yep.    Host: One of my favorites, actually, was spacesuits.  Someone suggested spacesuits, and I was like, \"Oh my gosh, of course we have to have a spacesuits episode.\"  So we brought on Les Padilla, hardware manager for the EMU, which is the suit they have up on the Space Station right now.  That's the one they actually go outside the Space Station and work outside in.  And we just had a chat about what spacesuits are all about.  So if you like the show, please give us suggestions on what you would like to listen to and we will actually pay attention to those.  The way I've been doing it is you have to type in Houston, We Have a Podcast to, like, Twitter or Facebook or something because that's what I do.  I just kind of, like, search that within the social media platform.  Like, \"Oh, that's a really good idea.\"  What was the other one we did?  BEAM.    Alex Perryman: BEAM, yeah.    Host: BEAM was another suggestion.  I was like, \"Oh yeah, we should totally do one on BEAM.\"  Because at the time the actual studies had sort of wrapped up.  And now it's there as, like, a storage unit on the Space Station.  So that one's pretty cool.  And then also, this one would actually be really helpful for us, too, is rate us.  Five stars would be preferred.  But, you know, whatever you think.  If you really enjoy the podcast, that actually helps us say to our managers, \"Hey, look, people really like this and we should continue to do it.\"  So please leave some stars and then any comments you have for us, both praise and anything critical.  Because we will pay attention to that and kind of fix it along the way.  Have we?  I think we've made a couple fixes.    Alex Perryman: Yeah, the room change was one of them.    Host: The room change was definitely one of them, yeah, and the mic.  And we actually have a -- we have a third mic right now, and we're hopefully going to get some more.  But yeah, if you want to see more, like, video episodes or if you want to do --    Dan Huot: Yeah, those would be fun.    Host: Longer, shorter, if you have a topic, you know, just leave them there.  And I'll end by saying thank you to Alex for sticking with me the whole time and dealing with all of my stuff.    Alex Perryman: Yay.    Dan Huot: Yay.    Host: All of my nagging, \"Hey, did you send the transcription yet?  Hey, when is this going to be edited?  Hey, can I get -- \" yeah, so anyway.    Alex Perryman: I just need to edit this.  It's 2.5 seconds right here and we should be good.  We should be good.    Host: And for Dan because I can't do this all by myself.  So thank you for coming on and hosting and being a part of it and helping to get it off the ground.    Dan Huot: I mean, I do the easy stuff.  So.     [ Laughter ]  No, I would thank you guys because you built this from scratch.  And now we're 52 episodes in.  And we have a cake.  So you did a really good.    Host: Awesome.    Alex Perryman: Thank you.    Host: Cool.  All right, I think we'll end there.  And oh yeah.  Well, okay, the final thank you is to you, the listener.  Thank you for tuning in.  Thank you for subscribing.  Thank you for listening to our show and keeping us going and giving us feedback so that we can continue to do this.    Alex Perryman: Yay.    Host: Yay.     [ Whistles ]     [ Laughter ]    Dan Huot: Cake.    Alex Perryman: You can press the red button now, Pat.     [ Music ]     Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  We had a lot of the fun recording this annual episode -- well, the one-year birthday episode of Houston, We Have a Podcast.  And I'm glad I got to sit with my team.  And really, thanks to Alex for sticking with me through the whole thing and dealing with all of my crap.  She's sitting right next to me [Laughs], constantly bugging her every single week.  \"Hey, is the transcript ready?  Hey, is the episode ready?\"  So it's been quite a ride.  And then Dan just helping out from start to finish, just making sure that it's successful all the way through.  So also one thing I forgot to mention during the episode was a huge thanks to NASA in Silicon Valley podcast for our friends over at Ames.  Whenever we were starting the podcast, I kind of didn't really understand fully how to do it the NASA way, and they already had their established.   So I was actually talking with Matt Buffington and Jerry Colon, some of those guys out there to understand just how do you do this?  And they were very helpful along the way.  So thanks, guys, if you're listening.  Really appreciate your help.  You can go listen to them.  That's NASA in Silicon Valley.  Otherwise you can listen to Gravity Assist.  That's our other NASA podcast out at headquarters.  And hopefully we'll have a couple more coming because I'm really digging the whole podcast scene here at NASA.  So otherwise you can go to NASA.gov/ISS to get the latest information on the International Space Station.  If you've noticed through all of our 52 episodes, a lot of them have been directly related to some of the research and the people, actually, that actually go and work on the International Space Station.  So you can learn a lot there.  We are still taking #AskNASA questions.  So use that hashtag and then just make sure to mention Houston, We Have a Podcast and we'll bring your questions or ideas right on the show.   We even said, you know, the spacesuit episode and the BEAM episode.  There's been a couple others, too, that were directly influenced -- space medicine, the one with Natasha Chough, astronaut health, that was another one.  Hey, I want to learn what a flight surgeon does.  We're like, \"Okay, let's bring her on.\"  So yeah, all of these were suggestions from you guys, the listeners that we brought right on the show.  So just make sure to mention Houston, We Have a Podcast.  And we'll make more episodes.  I mean, we do this every week.  So the more you give us, the more we can do.  Really appreciate you guys listening, too.  It really means a lot to us to help us to keep going.  So this birthday episode was recorded on June 20th, 2018.  Thanks to Kelly Humphries, Pat Ryan, Bill Stafford.  Pat and Bill we actually had in the room with us during the recording.  They're essential to the group right now.  And also Greg Wiseman, who has also been helping out.  You know, when the audio wizard is not here, Greg come.  And he's just Greg.  We have audio wizard and Greg.  Thanks always to Alex Perryman and Dan Hewitt.  And then thanks to you for listening and helping with the success of the podcast.  That helps us to keep going.  We'll be back with a brand new episode next week.",

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center.  Episode 71: Apollo and the Moon.  I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today.  So if you're familiar with us, this is where we bring in scientists, engineers, astronauts, all the coolest people to tell you all the cool stuff about NASA.  We explore a lot about human space flight and dive deep into so many topics.  So we're celebrating 50 years since the era of the Apollo missions to the moon.  And there was a lot of political drive behind this initiative.  But there was also some fascinating science.  And it may not look like much, but the moon is full of stories.  Stories about how the earth formed.  Stories of fire and energy.  And there's a very interesting perspective on exploring the moon.  We haven't been since 1972, but there's still so much that we're learning about this celestial body.  And there's plenty of reason to go back.  To give different perspectives on the moon, we have Jennifer Ross-Nazzal and John Gruener.  Jennifer is the resident historian here are the Johnson Space Center.  And can explain in-depth the history of the Apollo program and the first journey to the moon.  Much of it of how and why.   John Gruener is a planetary scientist.  Has been on the podcast before to talk about [inaudible] resource utilization or living off the land.  Basically using the environment to create things you need like fuel, water, or building materials.  So today we're going to go back in time and explore the Apollo program and what it took for humans to land on the moon.  And then we'll discover what we learned about our planet—about our nearest celestial body to our planet from John Gruener.  History can be a great way to learn how to do things better in the future.  So we'll use some of this knowledge to explore the missions ahead.  So with no further delay, let's jump right ahead to our talk with Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal and Mr. John Gruener.  Enjoy.    [ Music ]    Host: Jennifer and John, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today.    John Gruener: Sure, my pleasure.    Host: This is an interesting topic because I usually we stick with one, and John, you're familiar because you came on the podcast before.  You, when you came on here, we talked about living off the land, [inaudible] resource utilization.  Using what you got on the land to create stuff that you need.  But this one is a little bit of a mix because with all the Apollo anniversaries coming up.  I kind of wanted to explore not only the history and really get into that.  And Jennifer, I'm so excited to have you here.  Because the JSC historian?  Oh my gosh!  I have so many questions.  But also the science.  You know?  Not only did we go there, but there's so much that we learned and we're still learning with the moon rocks.  Even with our conversation with Ryan Ziegler not too far, not too long ago.  I forget which podcast episode that was.  But yeah, we, there's still so much to learn.  So this is going to be interesting.  I wanted to start with the history first.  So Jennifer, if you want to kind of, kind of launch it off.  We're going to the moon, right?  And this is, there's a lot of reasons why we're going to the moon.  Back in the Apollo era in the '60s, we have, you know, John F Kennedy.  After 15 minutes of spaceflight experience on the Mercury program.  John F Kennedy stands up there and says, \"Cool!  We're going to the moon now.\"  And it's this kind of political drive.  Was that the main reason why we decided, you know, the moon.  Was, was it mainly the politics?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well I think when you're talking about Apollo, you really need to think about like you've said, the circumstances of the time period.  And it was more than just politics.  Really, you need to think at the broader picture.  The Cold War that was happening at that time.  The Soviet Union was well ahead of the United States in terms of space at that point.  Yes, we had just sent Alan Shepherd to space.  We had 15 minutes of space, like you said.  But the Soviets had launched several successful satellites well before we did.  We had a lot of very public problematic launches.  And a lot of people questioned whether or not we were capable of doing what we said we were going to do.  The Soviets, of course every launch was very secret.  We were a very public agency.  So people got to see all of our failures on the public stage.  And so you know Kennedy is trying to think of how we might best the Soviet Union.  You know, what's the best way?  How can we catch up?  We're, we're always seemingly behind.   And so this is the best way.  By coming up with a new plan.  You know, NASA had been studying how we might get to the moon.  But this is an accelerated plan.  He wants to get there by the end of the decade.  And Bob Gilruth who ends up becoming Center Director here at the Manned Spacecraft Center.  Remembers listening to the president.  He was actually flying to Tulsa for a meeting.  And he remembers hearing the President.  And saying he was aghast at these ides-- this idea that we were actually going to go to the moon by the end of the decade.  Because he was going to be responsible for achieving that goal.  And so far, all we had was 15 minutes in space.    Host: Right.  I'm sure he had a sort of a course in mind, based on the progress that it would take.  To I don't know, continue to evolve human space flight.  But this definitely accelerated the plans.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Absolutely.  Yeah, there was a, there was a lot that had to be achieved by the end of the decade.  You know, they, they had been studying how to get to the moon.  They weren't really sure how to do it.  We've, we've done a lot of interviews with engineers who were working on that.  And, and they, they asked Bob Gilruth, \"Well, how are we going to do that?\"  “I don't know, but that's your job.  Go out and figure out how we're going to get to the moon.”  And now suddenly here we are.  We've got, we've got a deadline.    Host: Yeah.  So before, so before we start looping in the science.  Let's continue with some of the history.  So now we have this proclamation.  We're going to the moon.  What are the next steps?  How did it accelerate to, to, to make sure we were going to make that, that deadline?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah, well, you know, there were a lot of things that we had to figure out.  We had to determine, what was the mode that we were going to take to the moon?  We weren't really sure how we were going to get there.  The original idea was something that was called direct ascent.  And that was taking this huge rocket known as Nova.  And just flying directly to the moon, and then flying back to earth.  And you know people thought that was a great idea.  But the problem was it was too heavy.  It was going to be way too expensive.  And it was going to take way too long.  But that idea was being discussed for, for you know, many months.  And then there were also two other ideas that were bounced around.  One was Earth Orbit Rendezvous which was taking up two vehicles.  They were going to launch separately.  And they were going to rendezvous and dock in space.  And then they were going to go to the moon.  A lot of people at Marshall really liked that idea.  And then there was another idea that was put forth by people at Langley.  And that's the mode that we ended up using which was Lunar Orbit Rendezvous.   And that actually, that idea was not very popular at first.  The advocates of that actually tried to appeal to headquarters.  Quite often people at the Manned Spacecraft Center initially were not big fans of it.  Eventually they did end up adopting that idea.  Because it was much easier.  It didn't require as much technological work.  It only required one launch.  It enabled the agency to come up with spacecraft specific for earth orbit.  Lunar orbit, and then we had a lunar lander that we could build specifically just for landing on the moon.  And we also didn't need to bring it back.  So it wasn't as much weight as the Direct Ascent rocket that we would have sent.  So we had to come up with that.  That was one of the things that we had to come up with.    Host: Wow.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You know, we had to train astronauts.  We had to hire more astronauts.  There were a lot of things that had to be done.  Human spaceflight.  Also when NASA was formed, a lot of people thought it was a fad.  Someone, Hugh Dryden, for instance likened it to shooting a lady out of a cannon.  A lot of people who worked for the space task group were very young.  We've interviewed a lot of people who talked about how they were discouraged by their mentors at Langley from taking positions with the space task group because they said.  When human spaceflight is done, you're not going to have a job back here.  So they really tried to discourage them from taking those jobs.    Host: Oh, wow.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: But they were of course very excited about this new opportunity.  This new field.  And so of course we need a new center.  As soon as Kennedy announced that we were going to the moon.  We need a human spaceflight center.  Where we're going to train these astronauts.  Where we're going to house the operations.  So we start looking for a new facility in which we can do all of these things.  Which eventually becomes the Manned Spacecraft Center here in Houston.  What's known as the Johnson Space Center today.    Host: Yeah, and it's because Lyndon B Johnson had a great deal to do with getting it here, right?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well, you know, interestingly enough.  A lot of people like to say that.  And it's great because we're here in the Johnson Room here in Houston.    Host: Yeah, I thought it was appropriate.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah, it's totally appropriate.  But there's, there's a name that most people don't often associate with human spaceflight.  And that's Albert Thomas.  You may recognize the name from the post office on El Camino here in Houston?    Host: Okay.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And at the time he was head of the House Appropriations Committee.  And he had been for years actually trying to get the Atomic Energy Commission to build a center on this site.  And they were interested.  So when NASA was established.  He started appealing to the first administrator.  And there weren't any plans to build a center here in Houston.  They were building one out in D.C. in Greenbelt.  And he actually threatened the administrator.  He said he wasn't going to give him any money to build that center unless he moved it to Houston.  And eventually, there's a lot of politicking going on.  Once they make the decision that they're going to build a center somewhere in the United States dedicated to human spaceflight.  There's a lot of politicking going on between Albert Thomas because he holds the purse strings for NASA.  We have a lot of Houston boosters like George R Brown.  You recognize his name.  He's got a company, he's a big supporter of Lyndon B Johnson.  Lyndon Johnson, as you pointed out, is the Vice President at the time.  And there's a lot of other people, folks at Rice in particular who were very interested in having a NASA center come to Houston.   So there's a lot of behind the scenes politicking going on.  Trying to bring a center here.  And they actually do visit about 23 sites all over the United States.  Places like Boston and Tampa.  Tampa is actually the number-one choice of NASA.  At MacDill Air Force Base.    Host: Really?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah, originally it was the number-one choice.  Houston was number two.  So we end up coming here primarily I think because of Albert Thomas.  Not necessarily Johnson.  Johnson, I think, played a role.  But not as big of a roll are Thomas because he had those purse strings.    Host: Interesting.  Where's the Thomas Room?    John Gruener: Congressman from Houston, Texas.  And Sam Rayburn also from Texas was Speaker of the House.  So there was a strong Texas connection to why this place wound up where it is.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Absolutely.  And Olin Teague. I mean there's, there's.  We, we tend not to have a very strong Texas delegation these days.  But in the '60s, Texas had a lot of sway in Congress.  And if you have a lot of power in Congress, you can bring home the bacon to your constituents.  And so you know it was a really exciting time for the folks here in Houston.  You know, they got that space fever bug.  But you know we, we had to build new facilities and you know.  A lot, a lot of things were going on.    Host: Because the Clear Lake area wasn't really built up yet, right?  And so they kind of picked this plot of land.  And then all of a sudden create jobs.  Things start growing, right?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Absolutely, yeah.  It met all the requirements that NASA was looking for.  They needed at 1000 acres of land.  And if you look at photos from that time period.  There really wasn't anything on it.  A lot of people joked that they were told well you know, there are alligators on the property.  And when they came out-- because they, they actually invited people from Langley to come out and take what they call look-and-see trips.  They actually flew them out here to decide whether or not they were going to move here.  Because a lot of people were like Houston?  They didn't want to move to Houston.    Host: It’s hot.  Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: They thought Houston was a bad place to live.  A hurricane had just hit.    Host: Oh yeah. That won’t sell it.  Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: No.  Absolutely not.  So they weren't really thrilled about it.  But you know people came out and took trips.  And in no way was Clear Lake developed at that time.  It was really a rural area.  Webster had like a one-light stoplight.  And you know a general store, and that was kind of it.  There was a lot of fishing going on, a lot of shrimping, and not much else.  So you know Houston was about 20 miles up.  And even when people did move here, they had to go into Houston to go shopping.  To go out to eat.  There just wasn't a lot of development going on.  But once NASA says we're going to build here.  The company actually that, that donated the land which was donated to Rice.  It's sort of this big Texas deal.  You see the areas start to develop.  You see Clear Lake City develop.  You see Nassau Bay across the street start to develop.  So there's a lot of changes that happened as a result of NASA coming down here.    Host: Lot of growth.  And the reason that they wanted this center was primarily astronaut training.  Was it, was it Mission Control?  What were the primary reasons?  Primary, I guess, functions.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: The space task group was attached to the Langley Research Center.  And they wanted a separate center for human spaceflight.  It just really wasn't—    Host: Human spaceflight?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Human spaceflight, absolutely.  And so they needed a new center.  There were discussion about where to put Mission Control.  They weren't sure Mission Control was actually going to come here to JSC initially.  But they convinced the administrator to bring it here.  But yes, they needed a place to train astronauts.  They needed a place to put our engineers.  And they wanted the astronauts and engineers to work closely together on things like interfaces.  We also needed things like you realize we're close to the water.  So they wanted to bring in spacecraft by barge.  Houston was a great place to do that.  They also needed a convenient airport.  We have an airport just up the road.  They also wanted universities.  They wanted to live in a, in a place that was full of a, a vibrant cultural community.  Houston definitely was.  So you know Houston had a lot of perks.    Host: Alright.  At what point did, in the program, maybe it was when we decided we were going to the moon.  That the Lunar Curations facility started coming into play.  That this was going to be the place where moon rocks would be.    John Gruener: Right, because it was all focused on the humans, right?    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: Kennedy said we're going to send man to the moon and return him safely before the decade out.  And there was nothing in there about and while he's there, he's going to pick up rocks and bring them back to, you know.  It was all about the humans and getting them back safely.  But you know as, as the training progressed and as, as we went through Mercury and Gemini, we get into Apollo and then people start planning for an actual surface excursion, you know?  It's, it's when I, my first degree was in aerospace engineering.  Because I thought it was all about that cool flight back and forth, you know, to the moon.  And the spacecraft and the rockets.  But really, you have to ask yourself well, why are you even going to the moon, right?  This was obviously very political, geopolitical driven thing.  But, but nowadays, we ask ourselves why are we going back to the moon?  Or why are we going to Mars?  And it's all about what you're going to do on the surface, right?  And if you don't really have any plans to do something on the surface, well then why go in the first place?  But it was reversed during the Apollo.  So we, we were going to the moon.  So since we are going to the moon, what are we going to do when we get there?    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: And the obvious thing was geologic field work.  So NASA brought in a geoscientist also worked with the United States Geological Survey, USGS.  To train the astronauts in geologic field work.  What to look for.  How to employ long-lived scientific instruments.  And then they decided okay, well, we're bringing these rocks back and they're on this moon with no atmosphere, right?  No oxygen to interact with the rocks.  So and you're bringing it to Houston with a very humid atmosphere.  Host: Oh yeah.  John Gruener: Right?  Lots of water in our atmosphere here.  So what are the specifications?  What do we need to do to protect these rocks?  And so lot of work went into what we now have as the Apollo Sample Curation Facility.  You mentioned you talked to Ryan Ziegler.  He's running that now.    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: So yeah, science was very much, I won't say it's an afterthought.  But it came later in the, the process of, of getting to the moon.  And we're going to bring these rocks back, so we need to protect them.  We need the science labs to understand the rocks.  We did have Rice University, University of Houston just right up the road.  You know?  And a lot of the early scientists came from those institutions.  I don't know if you've ever talked to Dr. Wendell Mindell but he was here during Apollo.  He grew up a Houston boy.  Went to Rice, then went out to Caltech.  Well, went to Caltech first, then he went to Rice.  But so you know we, we drew.  You talked about one of the draws for why would the manned space center be here?  Well, we had these two university systems.  That we could pull from.  So you know the, the Lunar Sample Curation Facility started being designed.  But, but even before that from the science prospective it was like, and the safety prospective.  So we're going to land on this moon.  Is it just a dusty surface?  And we're going to sink into this bowl of dust?  And our astronauts aren't going to be able to get off, right?  So we had to send robotic missions to the moon to answer these, not only the lunar environment questions.  But lunar science questions.  You know, very simple thing.  Is the moon an intact surface that you can actually land on?  And walk on?  And work on?  And what a lot of people don't realize is we successfully sent 13 robots to the moon before Neil Armstrong ever set foot there, right?  So the Ranger program was basically a, a big camera.  Almost like a, you know, telescope.  And it just came closer and closer to the moon.  And it kept sending back pictures until it crashed into the moon, right?  A lot of those early Ranger missions didn't work, right.  We, we talked about our failures were right there in, in the public's view, right?  So in all we tried to send about 20 missions to the moon.  But only 13 of them succeeded.  Right?  And that was okay for robotic missions.  But that kind of success rate wouldn't work for humans, right?  13 out of 20.  But after the Rangers slammed into the moon, gave us our first up-close views.  Then we had some lunar orbiters that went into orbit around the moon.  They started taking high-resolution images to pick landing sites.  And then the surveyor landers actually went down and actually touched, landed on the surface of the moon.  Showed that it was competent.  You could walk and work there.  Even had a alpha particle X-ray spectrometer which measure the chemistry of the, on, on the surface of the moon.  Those up-front, those cameras right there in front of the field of surveyor gave us an idea of what the surface was like.  It kind of looked like you know a beach.  Sandy, gravel-y stuff.  So there was a lot of science going on behind the scenes while the humans were in the spotlight.    Host: Right.  So I mean just to, to understand the moon.  Does that, that takes a lot of energy to, to get up there.  Even those robotic missions, maybe smaller rockets, but now you want to send humans.  And like you said with this lunar rendezvous profile, Jennifer.  That's, you're talking about large spacecraft, multiple space, spacecraft.  You need a giant rocket.  So that's when the Saturn V starts coming in, right?  So what was the story there?  To actually make this lunar, this human lunar mission possible?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well, yeah.  I mean, we needed, we needed a large rocket.  And Marshall Space Flight Center was heavily involved in developing that Saturn rocket.  And you know what, it didn't need to be as large as that Nova rocket that we talked about for Direct Ascent.  But that was, that was something that they, they worked on.  The German engineers out there at Marshall Space Flight Center.  Here at, at JSC, we were more focused on things like building the spacecraft itself.  So the command module that you see the astronauts working and living in.  As they go to the moon and return back home.  That's really the only thing that gets to come back also from the moon.  And also working on that lunar lander, the lunar module that ends up traveling down to the moon's surface.  And the astronauts live in while they're on the lunar surface.  So you know there's a lot of work that needs to be done.  And there's a lot of contractor all across the United States that were working on this program.  And also universities.  People like at MIT who were working on different projects.   So there, there were thousands of people who worked on the Apollo program.  You know, just people that, that you might not associate with the Apollo program.  People—seamstresses who were sewing space suits for instances, and gloves that the astronauts wore on the moon.    Host: Oh yeah.  Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So you know, there are, there are a lot of people involved in this program.  I think a lot of the, the people that we often think of and associate with Apollo are the people that get the most attention.  Who appear on these magazine covers like the astronauts, of course, on life magazine.  Or you might see Chris Kraft who was on the cover of Time Magazine.  All the Mission Control folks before we had TV.  And on the spacecraft we would see what was happening in Mission Control.  That's where all the action was.  But you know we don't often think about all the engineers and the scientists and all the other people who made this program successful.    Host: Right.  And there was with so many people involved.  You said there was a lot of designing, design work going on here, right?  For the command module.  Was the lunar module here too?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.    Host: Okay, do you know if the picking up moon rocks, as John was describing was part of the design.  Or was it designed for a function and you fit the moon rocks in there?    John Gruener: It was exactly that.    Host: It was the second one?    John Gruener: So, yes.  So we have this spacecraft.  How many suitcases can we take with this, right?  It's like you're planning on a trip.  You just kind of know that there's these overhead bins in the airplane that you can fit your suitcases in, right?  So once the ascent module, the lunar module that would come off of the moon.  And once the command module, once that volume was kind of set and they started putting things in.  It was like okay, now how many suitcases of rocks can we fit in?    Host: Yeah.  Okay.  Now after, of, of course the first Apollo, Apollo XI landing.  That was of fairly short duration, right?  A few hours, I think they were actually walking on the moon?  And collecting rocks and just putting it in there?  But the new technologies started coming out with some of the later missions, right?  Now we have a rover.  I don't know, was there more capability to bring more rocks back?  What was evolving at the time?    John Gruener: Well, there was.    Host: Okay.    John Gruener: So you know, you talked about the size of the Saturn V, and I you know one of my buds in the Apollo in the astronaut office is Don Petit, and I know you've talked with Don Petit a couple of times on this podcast.  And he likes to talk about this thing called the tyranny of the rocket equation.  I don't know if you've heard that from him.  But when you're an aerospace engineer in college.  You learn all about the rocket equation.  And that basically tells you, you know, how fast you have to get moving to get off of the earth and escape earth's gravity.  And get to the moon.  And then how much you need to slow down to get in orbit around the moon.  And then you have to, okay, I got this, the velocity's worked out.  Now I'm trying to send a, a certain amount of mass to the moon.  The spacecraft, the people.  And so mass is a part of that rocket equation.  And the huge chunk of mass is the propellant.  You know, so now that you know the velocities you need.  How much mass you're trying to get somewhere.  Now you can figure out how much propellant you need.  And it was like 80% or so of that big, tall rocket.  Standing on the launchpads during Apollo.  80— , 75-80% of that was just propellant, right?  So the, this rocket equation.  You know, the tyranny of the rocket equation.  It all based on physics.  And of course physics haven't changed since Apollo, so we're still fighting it today.  And, and probably some of you know the biggest breakthrough is with this company called SpaceX. Where now they are reusing their booster stages.  Well, they'll, they'll launch off the pad and then they'll reuse their booster stage.  So you know you save the, the high-technology parts that the rocket engines, the fuel tanks and stuff.  But still, you've going to fill it up with a bunch of propellant because it, it just takes a lot of propellant to get the mass you're trying to get out there.    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: And then, I think I talked to you, when we were doing the Living Off the Land podcast, you know.  A lot of equations here at NASA, most of them extremely long with a lot of variables.  But the most important equation's real simple.  Mass equals money.  And if you want to send Apollo astronauts to the moon on a huge Saturn V that's just massive.  You have to have massive amounts of money, right?  So the, the Rangers, the surveyors, the lunar orbiters, the smaller spacecraft are a lot easier to get there.  A lot cheaper to get there.  So it's, it's, it's a huge commitment when you're talking about human spaceflight.  And you know, Kennedy, you know, people focus on the technology a lot.  But the cost of Apollo was incredible.  Sometimes up to four percent of the federal budget.  And, and Kennedy realized that.  And he said, \"You know, this is going to wrack some of our social programs.  I understand that.  But this is the second-most important thing as a nation we need to be doing right now.\"    Host: Yeah.  Because it was, because it was ultimately you know it wasn't just get to the moon and pick up rocks.  Which was scientifically astounding.  But at the same time, we had to beat the Soviet Union.  That was a, that was a huge part of it.    John Gruener: And when you're doing things for the first time, you know, from the engineering standpoint, you throw in a lot of margin, right?  So mass margin.  Propulsion margin.  Delta V, change in velocity margin.  And as you are flying these missions to the moon, you start understanding it better.  And so the, our last three missions, Apollo XV, XVI, and XVII, that's where we got the little electric cars that you talked about.  You know, buggies to drive around.  All of that increased capability on the surface of the moon, and bringing more mass to the surface of the moon.  Was because now that we understand our rockets better, we can release some of that margin and actually use it as payload.  So same rocket, but we just understand it better.  So now we can spend three days on the moon instead of one day.  We can bring a little electric car with us.  And we can bring back, you know, close to 100 kilograms of rocks and soil.  Where the first Apollo XI, they brought back a few, you know, tens of kilograms.  So it was an order of magnitude change with the Apollos XV, XVI, and XVII.  And that was all based on understanding our, our rockets better.    Host: Yeah.  So, so to make that possible, Jennifer.  I know like so the whole, NASA as a whole as John said was funneling a lot of money just into the Apollo program.  Is, was you know what percent of all of the agency was just Apollo?  And was, was there just less going on at NASA that allowed us to funnel more money into that single program?  Compared to now with all the different programs we have?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well, there were definitely other programs going on.  We did have people looking at space stations very early on.  NASA always wanted a space station.  So there were people looking at future programs.  You know, we, in the middle of working on Apollo, we were still working on Gemini, sending folks up there.  We had been working on Mercury.  We also started working on the Apollo applications program.  Which became known as Skylab.  When we launched Apollo XI, we actually had people working on the design of the space shuttle.  So money was, was being spent on other programs.  And of course you know we used a lot of money for facilities.  I think John was talking a little bit about bringing the lunar curatorial facility online.  When we originally built the Manned Spacecraft Center, that wasn't one of the, the buildings that was built.  No one thought about well, okay, we're going to go to the moon.  What are we going to do with these rocks?   Most of the people working here thought this was an engineering problem.  We need to send men to the moon.  We need to figure out how we're going to do it.  Size was sort of like oh yeah, kind of a moment.  And so we didn't actually start thinking about what we were going to do with those rocks.  Until later when we brought those geoscientists onboard.  And they said of course we're going to the moon.  We're going to get rocks, and then what are we going to do with these rocks?  We gotta keep them pristine.  We gotta make sure that they're protected from earth's atmosphere.  And so we didn't start building our lunar receiving lab until much later.  And then it, it's, it was a little fight actually to bring it here to Houston.  And the original design of that facility was very tiny.  We did not envision what eventually became known as the lunar receiving lab.  We thought we would just bring home some lunar rocks and package them and send them out to principal investigators.  And then other people got involved and said, \"Well, we have to be concerned about potential life forms coming back from the moon.\"  And suddenly this small little lab that we had, became this huge 83,000 square feet facility.   John Gruener: Yeah sadly the lunar receiving lab, it was in Building 37.  And then they built Building 31 where the, the lunar rocks are now.  And all sorts of collections.  It's not just about the moon.  We, we have astromaterials from all over the solar system.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: You know, different collections.  And sadly, Building 37 is set to be demolished right now.  Yeah, and that's where, that's where the original lunar receiving lab was.  That's where the quarantine facility was for the first few missions to Apollo.  But it wasn't big enough just to handle all of these rocks that are coming back from the moon.  You know, the, it's, it's surprising.  You, you look at the calendar from you know '69 to '72.  And, and how often we were going to the moon back then.  And you know every one of those trips brought back more rocks.  It's like where are we going to put these things?  So before Building 31 got built, there were safes, you know, like bank safes all over the center holding little sealed containers of moon rocks.  They were scattered all over site.   Host: Wow.  John Gruener: Until we got Building 31.  And that, that lunar curation facility built.  And so you know, it's kind of fun to, to think about how these moon rocks were just scattered all over.  Because we just didn't have that building yet.    Host: Yeah.  So did the, did the geoscientists and just science in general look at the rocks and have questions already about you know knowing what rocks they wanted to bring and what they wanted to study?  Or was it just get the rocks and we will study it later and figure it out?    John Gruener: Well, you know, people have been looking at the moon for centuries, first with our eyes.  And then as these things called telescopes got bigger and bigger you could look at the moon in ever-increasing detail.  And by looking at the surface features, the topography, the terrain on the moon, geoscientists had a pretty good idea, you know, that those dark areas up there on the moon were going to be some type of lava, you know.  Because you look on earth here and it's dark lava, right?  Coming out of Hawaii and other places.  So they had, you know, they had a pretty good idea of the dark areas on the moon.  Weren't quite sure about the bright areas of the moon.  You know, you look up at the, the moon at night.  And you'll see the dark areas and the bright areas.  And here's a great you know time for a public service announcement.  This Saturday is the International Observe the Moon Night.  And, and so there's stuff going on all over the country here in Houston.  At Space Center Houston.  We'll, we'll, we'll have you know something going on with the Lunar Planetary institute and JSC.  But all over the world, there are these events, you know just to look up at that moon at night.  And, and, and say wow, there it is, and we've been there, right?    Host: Oh yeah.    John Gruener: But those bright areas of the moon we weren't so sure about.  And a matter of fact, on Apollo XVI, that was our real own mission.  Only mission that went to those bright areas of the moon.  They train the astronauts to look for these light-colored volcanic rocks called rhyolite.  Right?  So basalt's really dark.  That's stuff coming out of Hawaii.  So you see these dark lava flows.  You have these beautiful black sand beaches.  That result from the breakdown of those volcanic rocks.  Well, they're also, volcanic rocks are higher in silicon.  And they're, they're much lighter in color.  And so they, they train these Apollo XVI astronauts to look for these felsic you know volcanic rocks.  But they also trained them in other types of rocks and minerals.  And when John Young and Charlie Duke landed there, it was like, you know, they didn't quite say, \"Houston, we have a problem.\"  But they said, \"Hey, this isn't exactly that volcanic landscape you told us it was going to be,\" right?  So then we get these rocks back.  And then, and now we can start formulating ideas on how the moon formed and why are these particular rocks and minerals there?  So we had a broad idea of what we might find on the moon.  But clearly, you know, no real understanding of, about those bright areas.    Host: Yeah, that's one of my favorite parts about the Apollo program is just you, they, they had a mission.  And then they did that mission.  And then the next mission was kind of evolving and doing new things, right?  Let's add a car.  Let's take away margin.  Let's pick up more rocks.  It's, it was just fascinating to see that.  And then just dealing with those challenges as they came along.  Because everything was new, so obviously not everything was going to be perfectly planned.  Including, where are you going to put the moon rocks whenever you get them?    John Gruener: And there's even a program called the Apollo Applications Program, of AAP.  And that was if we use the lander stage that brought, brought the astronauts to the surface of the moon.  And we put a little house on it or a habitat.  Right?  Now we could actually stay on the moon for more than a handful of days.  And we could you know start this idea of a lunar base or a lunar outpost.  Where we were up there for months at a time instead of days at a time.  But none of that ever made it to prime time, you know.  We had Apollos XVIII, XVIIII, and XX in, in the plans.  And those didn't make it into it either.    Host: Right, yeah.  No, I, it was a lot of a funding issue.  Jennifer, I know like as it was going along.  Was it the public interest was sort of kind of falling off?  You know, we landed on the moon and that was like yay!  And then they did it again.  It was like, well this is, this is the same thing.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well actually funding started to fall in the mid-sixties under Lyndon Johnson.  We were in the middle of, of fighting the Vietnam War.  We were also fighting a war on poverty.  You know, you couldn't have your guns and butter, like they, they say.  And so you know that, that was part of the issue.  You know, we had had this, this huge budget.  And you actually see it on a graph.  It just sort of declines rather precipitously.  So things had fallen off well before we even landed on the moon or went around the moon.    Host: Yeah.  Now, that was kind of when we started thinking about even missions beyond, too, right?  That's Skylab was sort of let's take this thing that we have and fit it into a space station sort of concept, right?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Absolutely, yeah.  You know, how can we use some of the equipment that we have for Apollo to create a space station?  And so we start looking at that.  We also start looking at like I said, the Space Shuttle in 1969.  Max Faget comes up with this idea for a reusable spacecraft.  Because we, we couldn't really reuse anything from Apollo.  It was all throwaway.  And so, you know, we come up with this new idea.  It's going to be cheaper.  We're going to fly more regularly.  And we start working on those designs in 1969.  We have people who are about, 20 people who are locked in a room here at JSC working on what's it going to look like?  How's it going to operate?    Host: So that was actually, that's actually a huge part of the Apollo program and one of the difficulties looking forward now.  Is we're talking-- John, you mentioned returning to the moon.  And what are we going to do?  A lot of it is dealing with staying there for a long time.  Learning how to work and live.  But the Apollo program, all of these pieces of technology.  The lunar lander, the, the rovers, the command module.  They were meant for just using that one time.  They had limited consumables, right?  So when you're kind of designing that mission.  Taking away that margin like you said, how, how does that work?  How do you?  Was it, everything just built to be thrown away?  How do you justify the lifespan of the technology itself?    John Gruener: Well, we had that schedule, you know.  Send a man to the moon, return him safely before the end of the decade.  So as long as you have a president pushing this.  And then you have a Congress supporting the president pushing this.  And throwing lots of money at it.  You can make things work, brute force, you know, get it there, get it done.  But you're not thinking long-term operations.  You're not thinking sustainable operations.  So Apollo was not sustainable.  But it wasn't meant to be sustainable.  It was meant to beat the Soviet Union to the moon.    Host: Exactly.  Yep, that makes sense.  So now, now we have, we've used the, the technology to get us to the moon.  We used the technology to get those moon rocks back.  What have we been learning?  You know, we have all of this moon rocks.  We built the facility, put them in.  Now we're, we're looking at them.  What is so interesting about the moon?    John Gruener: Well, I wish I could say we've answered all the questions.    Host: I guess that's a good thing, right?  There's still more.    John Gruener: Oh, there's, there's tons of more questions, right?  But we have a better idea of, of maybe how the moon formed.  Before we went to the moon with Apollo, there were three, you know, major theories or hypothesis on how the moon formed.  One was called the fission theory.  Where there, there, the early proto-earth is, is spinning on its axis really fast.  And it's, you know, it'll throw off a blob or two out into space.  Around the equator where it's spinning the fastest.  And those blobs would eventually form this moon, right?  So that was the fission theory.  But the problem with that is the earth is not spinning fast now.  So what happened to all that angular momentum.  If you're spinning so fast to spin off blobs to make the moon.  Why aren't we spinning that fast now?  So we said okay, maybe that doesn't work.  Then there was the idea that the moon and the earth formed in the same neighborhood at the same time.  In the same neighborhood.  And you know, so it's kind of like a binary planetary system, if you will.  Right?  And when the first moon rocks came back, they were very similar to the earth.  It's like, ah, Coaccretion right?  That, that's, that's the thing that actually happened.  The moon and the earth formed together.  But then there were some small difference.  You know, so well, maybe that doesn't quite work either.  And, and how do you get, again, this, this binary system where the moon's orbiting the earth, right?  How do you get all that to work physics wise?  If they form together in the same neighborhood.  So I don't know, still up in the air.  But it, it was more favored than say the fission theory.  And then there was the capture theory.  That the moon formed somewhere else.  You know kind of the same distance from the sun as the earth.  But, but somewhere else.  And then as the earth and the moon came close together.  The gravity of the earth pulled the moon in, right?  It got it into orbit.  So that was the capture theory.  So those are the three main ideas on how the moon formed.  Well, when then rocks came back.  More and more people started thinking about this.  Says you know?  How about this idea?  You know let's just call it the big whack idea where there's a Mars-sized planet out there.  And it slams into the earth in the, you know, early history of the solar system.  And that collision then throws out or ejects you know all sort of particles and mass into orbit around the earth.  Much of it rains down back on earth.  But some of it stays in orbit.  And then all of that debris from that giant impact formed the moon.  And so that's kind of the prevailing theory right now.  This thing called the giant impact theory for the formation of the moon.  And then when you started looking at the actual minerals of the moon.  It's like, wow.  We think the moon, you know, at least the upper surface of the moon was completely molten at one time.  So you know you think of the Star Wars movies, and Mustafar, where they have those great light saber duels.  And it's a very volcanically active planet, right?  Well, we get these, these rocks and minerals back from the moon.  And the best way we can explain them is that there was a magma ocean, if you will.  On the outer hundreds of kilometers of the surface of the moon, right?  And, and as, as the, the lava or magma cooled, the lighter the rocks, the rocks with the lighter elements in it kind of floated towards the top.  The rocks with the heavier elements kind of sunk to the bottom.  And you kind of have some segregation going on there.  And so this magma ocean hypothesis now has come up.  Not only for the moon, but maybe all of the inner, you know, the planets and the moons in the inner solar system.  So the moon's not only teaching us about how the moon formed, but possibly how the inner solar system formed.  All the different planets.   Host: Wow.  John Gruener: And then you look up at the moon.  You know, we're all going to look at the moon this Saturday, right?  International Observe the Moon Night.    Host: I know I will.    John Gruener: And you look up at the moon.  You see those circular dark features.  And those are big flood lavas.  Basaltic lava, like out of Hawaii.  But before that lava was there, there were huge holes in the ground.  So when something hits the moon, it makes a crater.  Everybody kind of familiar with that term, crater.  But when the crater is huge like continent size, we call them basins.  Impact basins.  And so there's a real question is when did all those basins form on the moon?  And did they form all at once, you know, or relatively near in time?  You know, hundreds of millions of years apart?  Or was there kind of a steady formation over the first couple billion years of the moon?  So we have this thing called the cataclysmic bombardment idea.  That all of these big holes on, on the moon were created pretty much at once.  But if it was happening on the moon, it was also happening at the earth, right?  So we're trying to tie in the, the impact ages of the moon.  And the, the life on earth.  And when did life, you know, what are oldest fossils on the earth?   And how do we tie that into the formation ages of the surface of the moon?  And then the big impact basins.  So what we've learned a lot from the moon is that very early beginning of our inner solar system.  And not just for the moon, but for, you know, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Earth.  All, all of that.  So the moon is just a great laboratory to test ideas and hypothesis on planetary formation and then differentiation between crust and mantle and core.  We learn about all that in junior high school science class.  Right?  So we, we've learned a lot about the moon.  But of course, any time you get into an, an experiment in science.  You answer your maybe your primary question.  But all these secondary questions start to pop up.  And because we brought the rocks back.  We could put them in very detailed scientific instruments.  You know, in laboratories.  And measure things down to the parts per million or parts per billion.  And so now we're, we're trying to understand you know why do these rocks have chlorine in them and these rocks don't?  You know?  So you know and, and that gets into, you know, that whole idea of geochemistry and petrology of the moon, you know.  Really, really fine details have been argued now for, for decades.  And maybe you know, to the, to the common person that kind of stuff doesn't really matter.  But it does.  When you're trying to you know take bits and pieces of space debris and put them together to make a planet.  It, it's all important.    Host: Yeah, that's actually one of my favorite things about—I, I have a lot of astromaterials folks on the podcast because I find it fascinating.    John Gruener: It's a fun place to work.    Host: It, it's super fun.  And you can look at a rock and get this fascinating story about molten lava and this fiery world and bombardment.  And all these fantastic stories all from looking at a rock.  And you can get a history.    John Gruener: Yes, as a matter of fact.  So on Apollo XI, they had one suitcase.  And the astronauts were trained to, you know, pick up the rocks with their, with their devices.  Their little tongs or what not.  Shovels and scoops.  And put the, the rocks into bags, right?  And then seal up the bags.  And put the bags into a box.  And then close the box.  And you know Neil was on the surface.  And he, he looked in this box and it was full of rocks.  But as you know, rocks don't pack perfectly.  So there was a lot of void space.  He just used a shovel.  He started piling dirt into the box to fill up the, the void space.  And that sample which is 10084, so we, we number all of our samples that came back from the moon.  And, and 10084 was just that dirt that Neil decided we need to fill up all this empty space in the suitcase to make this trip really worth it.  And some people look at that, that soil sample.  And you, you can describe the, the formation of the moon from that one soil sample.  Right?  All the other rocks and soils help validate what, what, what you could do with 10084.  But yeah, it's amazing what you can do with just a little bit.    Host: Unbelievable.  So I mean, this was one of those things that was completely new, right?  It's like go to the moon and pick up rocks.  And then when you do, you realize how much space is left over.  So you kind of have to pull an audible and say, \"Alright, let's fill that space.\"  Jennifer, I'm sure you've talked to a lot of folks that have actually walked on the moon.  Can you talk about the difficulties of just adjusting to the one-sixth g?  And what they were learning from each other as time went on?  And more and more people started walking on the moon?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You know, I’m try to think about—We have talked to a number of people who have walked on the moon.  But I don't think any of them have talked about necessarily the difficulty that they encountered.  I think more what they talk about is just the beauty of the moon.  And our place in the, the solar system.  And how in awe they were of, of being on the moon.  And this great accomplishment.  And the opportunity that they had as an astronaut to be in the lunar surface.  And the contributions that they and other people made to the Apollo program.  I think it was just a once in a lifetime opportunity for them.  You know, people like you know Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt.  All of those guys, you know.  It's just, it was an amazing opportunity.    John Gruener: And, and Buzz Aldrin, you know, he said this is magnificent desolation.  What a great way to describe that, the lunar surface, right?    Host: Yeah.  John Gruener: Because it is magnificent, but it is desolate.  There's nothing there.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: As, as, as you know, human explorers have gone all over this planet.  But we always encounter other peoples.  Or other animals, right?  Or other plants.  And of course none of that was on the moon.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: Do you know what?  We're talking a lot about those, those Apollo missions that went down to the surface of the moon.  Coming up here in a couple months, December will be the 50th anniversary of Apollo VII, VIII, right?    Host: Right, right.    John Gruener: And that photograph that they call earthrise.  So as the space, spacecraft were coming around from the back side of the moon.  You know, now you can start seeing the earth again.  And because of the motion of the spacecraft.  It kind of looked like the earth was rising into the sky, right?  And they scrambled to get their cameras in to take this picture.  And it made the cover of Time magazine.  And, and really, you know, a lot of people credit that photograph of, of the earth from the moon helping start the big environmental movement.  That you know we have a very fragile planet.  We'd better take care of it.  You don't see political boundaries from the moon.   Host: Right.  John Gruener: So you know those experience, those personal experiences that those, those guys had.  Were, were just tremendous.  And it's fun to talk to them about that.  So in the science world, we, we do bring, we did bring those guys back for discussions during the.  About ten years ago, we had the Constellation program.  And we were talking about going back to the moon.  And so the, the engineers who designed the spacesuits.  The scientist who want to do things on the moon.  We had a lot of discussions.  So how did those spacesuits work on Apollo?  And the question, and the answer was not very well.  You know, it kept them alive, but there was no mobility in the waist.  Very hard to walk.  Right?  So it was that lower-body mobility that they're really trying to get into the new suits.  For our return to the moon.  The gloves particularly were very hard to work.  So, so they're working real hard.  Amy Ross and others are working real hard to make nice gloves that you can use more easily.  The problem with spacesuits.  You know, you, you're like the Michelin man, you blow up.  And so you have to basically fight against the spacesuit to make it move.  Whether you want to open your hand.  Open your hand, you're pushing against the glove to open your hand.  You're pulling against the glove to close your hand.  And those, the Apollo astronauts, their hands were just wore out.   Host: Right.  John Gruener: Even the, the three days missions.  You know, Jack Schmitt will say, \"I couldn't have done more.\"  Because after those three days, you are just wore out from fighting your suit.  Trying to do the science that were on the agenda, right?  So, so scientists.  We have guys like Trevor Graff and Kelsey Young, geoscientists working with the suit designers now to try to get suits that work better on the surface of the moon that will allows scientists to bend over, to pick up a rock.  Or, because you, you know, there are blooper reels of these guys falling down.  Host: Right.  John Gruener: All over the moon, right?  And you know, it was mostly when they were trying to bend over to pick something up.  And of course they pop back up.  Because it was, it was easy with the one-six gravity.    Host: Yeah, yeah.  John Gruener: But it is a difficult place to get used to and to work.    Host: So by the end, what, how?  You said they were there for three days.  How long were those spacewalks that made it so tiring?    John Gruener: They're always less than eight hours, you know.  So think about your eight-hour work day.  Host: That’s still three days in a row.  John Gruener: Right, three days in a row, exactly.  So, so nowadays, we talk about future missions to the moon.  We talk about rotating the crews.  Very much like we did on the Space Shuttle.  Where we would have a Hubble Telescope repair mission.  And on one day, two astronauts would go out.  And then on the next day, two different astronauts would go out.  And then on the third day, maybe the same astronauts from the first day would go out so these, this idea of alternating crews.  And give them a day off in between EVAs to rest.  That's kind of what we're talking about with the moon.  And, and, and that's why that, you know, that, those long-term stays start to pay off.  Because if you and I wanted to go to Orlando and go to you know Disney World or Orlando, you know, the Studios there with Harry Potter World, and all that stuff.  We could go there.  You know, it's, most of the money is getting there, right?  And we could spend 30 minutes there, a couple hours there like Apollo XI.  But would we really get our money's worth?  You know, at Disney World if we only went there for 30 minutes to a couple hours?  Right?    Host: Right.  John Gruener: You want to spend the entire day.  You spent all this money and time and energy to get to Disney World.  You want to spend some time there and enjoy the rides.  And it's much the same thing with the moon.  So we know it's a hard environment to work in.  So you know, just use our smarts and, and rotate the crews.  And protect the crews.  You know, that's our number-one job here at JSC is the safety of the crews.   Host: Absolutely.  John Gruener: So we can't give them an impossible task to do on the moon.  But they, those guys in Apollo were, were giants.  I mean, they worked like Hercules out there, what they did on those three-day missions.    Host: Right.  Yeah, they were all mostly, well I think most of them were test pilots except for Jack Schmitt, right?    John Gruener: Scientist, yeah.    Host: Scientist, yeah.  So he was the one.  I'm sure he, you're, he's still very involved in the community, right?    John Gruener: Oh yes, yes.  We're getting ready to have a meeting in just a couple weeks.  Lunar exploration analysis group.  We meet once a year.  And Jack's always there.  And man is, is does he add to the conversation.    Host: Yeah, really well too.  Because you can all talk about the moon.  And he can say, \"Well, when I was there.\"  [Laughter] So he's got that on his side.  So Jennifer, I kind of wanted to end on, on this note.  Well actually first, I have a super-random question that I, it's just-- .    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Is it trivia?    Host: Well, yeah.  Well, it's something that has always been in the back of my mind.  I, I'm thinking about the Apollo XI landing, them actually landing on the moon.  You see Neil Armstrong get out of the lunar module and actually jump out and touch the lunar suit, surface.  How did the camera get there?  Did it shoot out from the lunar module once it landed?  Do you know?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: I'm not 100% sure.    Host: I've always been curious.    John Gruener: Yeah, so they did have externally mounted cameras.  And I'm not sure if it was on one of these little, you know, crisscross things that, that, that kind of telescope out you know.  To, to, you know, flop out one direction.  I'm not exactly sure either.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: How it was done.  I watched it as a kid.  I mean, we talked about the early '60s and, and John Gruener was a little boy growing up here in Houston.  Watching all this stuff.  And so you know, we happened to be in New Orleans when, when Apollo XI happened.  And I always was fascinated with well why can't we see right through these guys?  They're like ghosts.  Those early television images.  If you watch the Apollo XI guy.  You can see through them.  And I never understood that.  I'm not a photography guy.  But that's, we kept asking our parents.  \"Are they really there?  Because you can see right through them.\"    [ Laughter ]    Host: Yeah, those early, early TVs.  Alright, sorry that was a random, random question.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: No, and I hate to be-- .    Host: It's just something as the public affairs guy.  That's the part, stuff that gets to me.  It's just like how did they get that footage?  Where's that, where's that footage coming from?  And like the livestreaming capability.  I was always wondering.    John Gruener: And part of geologic training was to get the astronauts to take pictures of the rocks on the moon.  And up-close pictures, surface of the moon.  Well, Neil Armstrong had that camera on his chest.  Right?  So you see lots of picture of Buzz Aldrin on the moon from Apollo XI.  There are almost no pictures of Neil Armstrong on the moon.  The ones we do have are from those external camera that you talked about when he went down the ladder.  And also there are pictures where you can see Neil as a reflection in Buzz's visor.  They had those gold visors to protect them from the bright sun.  And you can see Neil in that visor.  But he had the camera.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: So my wife always complains about that.  We have all these vacation pictures, and I'm never in them!  [Laughter] So luckily there's things called selfies now, right?    Host: Yes, yes.  Need a selfie stick.  See there's a good Apollo technology.    John Gruener: Neil needed a selfie stick on the moon.    Host: A selfie stick, there you go.  But I do, I do want to end with this note.  Jennifer, you were talking about the astronauts talking about the beauty of the moon.  What were some of the things that really stuck out to you when you were talking with them?  Whether it was the beauty of the moon or the view of earth from the moon?  What were some of the things that stuck out?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well, some of the things that, that John was talking about.  Just the fact that, that earth seemed so fragile from where they were, you know?  You couldn't see the boundaries of countries or nations.  It was just one planet.  And you know, they were really struck by this blue marble in a sea of blackness.  It really stood out.  And it was such a unique place compared to other, other places like the moon.  Which was so stark and so desolate.    Host: Right.  John Gruener: And for those Apollo guys on the surface of the moon, they always saw earth, home, up in the sky.  Because all of the missions from Apollo were on the front side of the moon.  We never sent Apollo astronauts to the far side of the moon or the back side of the moon, right?    Host: Yes.  John Gruener: Matter of fact, no real spacecraft has done a mission back there yet.  The later this year, the, the Chinese are getting ready to launch Chang'e-4 and that will be the first spacecraft of any type.  To land on the far side of the moon.    Host: Wow.  John Gruener: So you know, just that, that draw to home.  There's home waiting for us.  Finish our work, and we get to go home, and there it is.  So some people worry about that with Mars.  You know, you go all the way to Mars.  And of course earth is not there in the sky.  It is, but it's teeny-tiny.  It's a little blue dot in the sky right?  But what will those people who work and live on Mars for long periods of time, how will they feel?  Because earth is so far away and they can't see home.  You know?    Host: Yeah, no that's a big thing.  I talked with a lot of folks from the human research program about isolation and confinement.  And what that does, especially for missions where you would be on Mars for a very long time.  And it's, it's real.  So you'd have to have that sort of connection.  Definitely something we need to explore.  And it's, it's an interesting point just to look up and say huh.  That's, that's everyone I know.  You know, everyone I know, everyone I've ever known is on just that little level of circle.  It's got to be just a profound feeling.  And I hope something that more people get to, get to talk about in the future, too.  Whenever we're talking about these upcoming lunar missions.  Just to see, get that perspective once again.  It's going to be fantastic.    John Gruener: Right, because it's not just NASA or the other space agencies like China.  We're starting to get commercial industry involved as well.  And commercial companies are now, you know, working on delivering things to the moon, including people.  So the hope and dream is that the commercial companies can not only take NASA astronauts to the moon, but they can take citizens to the moon as well.  To experience it.    Host: Yeah, for all mankind.  I love it.  [Laughter] Or humankind.  There you go.  Alright, so John and Jennifer, thank you so much for coming on!  This was, this was better than I expected, honestly.  Because I, I was kind of, I was kind of thinking like how are we going to combine the history and the science?  But I, I think it worked, and I really appreciate your time today.    John Gruener: Sure, it was fun.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Thanks for inviting us.    [ Music ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So today we talked with Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal.  And Mr. John Gruener about Apollo and the moon.  We went into the history and explored some of the science and how this is all going to help us here in the future.  So like I said, in the intro, we are in the middle of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo program and the missions that coincide with that.

        description: "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center. Episode 141, “The View from Above,” I'm Pat Ryan. On this podcast we talk with scientists, engineers, astronauts and other folks about their part in America's space exploration program. And today we're focusing on a very cool science part, honest. When we talk about the science being conducted on the International Space Station, we're usually talking about something happening in one of the many laboratory facilities inside the station's modules, the Destiny Lab or the Columbus or Kibo Laboratories. But those are not the only spots where science is done. For instance, last November we spent three episodes, 117, 118 and 119, discussing spacewalks to restore operations of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. It gathers data on cosmic particles from out on the top of the station's truss pointed out towards space. There are a number of other scientific experiments gathering data from out on the station's exterior. Many of them are pointed down from a perch 250 miles up. The space station provides a stable platform for scientists who are interested in a different perspective on the home planet. One of those scientists is Dr. William Stefanov, an internationally recognized researcher in remote sensing of urban, geological and ecological processes. He is manager of the Exploration Science Office in the Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science Division located at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. Stefanov serves as the International Space Station program scientist for Earth observations and at JSC for remote sensing of Earth. Today we're going to talk about some of those experiments and why they matter, including some experiments that turn out the really outstanding photographs of Earth that have been taken from the station. Be sure to check the episode webpage and the show notes, because there we posted the photos that we're talking about so that you can see them and follow along. Also, there are links to other sites where you can find other photographs. So, on the occasion of Earth Day, we offer a look at Earth from orbit with Dr. Will Stefanov. Here we go.  [ Music ]  Host: Will Stefanov, you were described to me as the Program Science Officer subject matter in the subjects of ISS remote sensing and Earth science. So, what do we mean by remote sensing and Earth science in this context?  William Stefanov: Well, remote sensing is the discipline and science of collecting information about a material without actually physically contacting it.  Host: The remoteness.  William Stefanov: The remoteness, exactly, exactly. So historically our eyes are basically the first, the primary remote sensing instrument that we have.  Host: Sure, OK.  William Stefanov: We look around our environment and we can tell things. You know, we can tell this is a carpet, this is a chair. You know, you're a person and I don't have to actually touch any of that to get that information, because I just happen to know it.  Host: OK.  William Stefanov: And my eyes are transmitting the information that's coming from light waves, essentially, the electromagnetic spectrum, into my eyes which are capable of seeing a pretty limited amount of the full amount of energy that's impinging upon us.  Host: You mean of the whole spectrum, right?  William Stefanov: Of the whole spectrum, of the whole spectrum. We only really see a very small part of the visible wavelength, red, green and blue, essentially. And it's up to our brains to figure out what that information that our eyes are telling us is. And our brains are awesome at that. We are probably still the best remote sensing instrument ever built or developed, I should say, at this point.  Host: Better than the ones humans have built out of stuff laying around.  William Stefanov: In many respects.  Host: Yeah.  William Stefanov: In many respects. But that being said, we have discovered over time that other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum contain information that is very useful to things like figuring out what minerals are on a planetary surface. Or what kind of chemicals are in a plant. Or what kind of stress a plant might be under, what kind of particulates are in the air. What kind of gases are being produced by an erupting volcano. These are all pieces of information that we ourselves can't natively see, but we can design instruments that can collect that information and then convert it into something that we can see.  Host: We can make machines that \"can see\" and gather that information from the rest of the spectrum.  William Stefanov: Exactly. Exactly.  Host: And Earth science, is that geology or is it more than that?  William Stefanov: It's -- well, I'm a geologist by training.  Host: And not to demean geology --  William Stefanov: Oh, no, no, no. Oh, you can't demean geology. But these days geology -- some of us prefer geoscience because the discipline has expanded to embrace not just the traditional looking at rocks and minerals but also bringing in what's the effect of plants on the surface. How does that affect soil development? How does the atmosphere affect how rocks weather and how elements are exchanged between the air, the water and the planetarium materials? So, geology in terms of remote sensing is kind of a natural fit. Because if you're a classical geologist, you're trained to do fieldwork. So, you get out there and you walk ridges and you make maps based on what you're walking over, what you sample, what you look at. And that's fantastic. That is a critical skill for geologists. But to understand some geologic processes and the broader landscape that you're walking on, sometimes it's really difficult to get that sense from just being on the ground. I mean, you can do it, but it takes an awful lot of time and an awful lot of effort. So what remote sensing brings to the table is it gives you that bird's eye view of the land surface. And when you get up above the land surface and you can see the whole thing, you begin to see patterns in the landscape that are completely evident from the air that are not immediately evident from the ground.  Host: From a wider perspective.  William Stefanov: Exactly, exactly. So, for instance, if you're looking at how rock beds are tilted or distributed across a landscape, you can get that information if you go and you walk every single ridge and you map all the orientations of the rock beds.  Host: Sounds fun.  William Stefanov: Well, it can be. Depends where you are.  Host: Yeah.  William Stefanov: But if you have a remotely-sensed image of the area where you can see how the beds are lined up and how they extend for hundreds of miles, it can become immediately obvious how the rocks are tilted or folded or how they've been affected by earthquake faults or things of that nature. And so, you've got that visual component. And then like I mentioned earlier, when you bring in more sophisticated remote sensing technologies to where you can look at things like chemical compositions or mineral identification, now you've added the ability to get much more information out of that image for that area than perhaps you as a human being walking by yourself and taking notes in your book can get at. I mean, a good geologist can pick up a rock and identify pretty well what kind of minerals in it and identify what kind of rock it is. But for some rock types that aren't so obvious, you need chemical information, or you need to know all the minerals in the rock. And that is information that we can now get from remotely sensed data. So, it's a great tool for enhancing the ability of a geologist to do the work. And this -- it's not just confined to geology. Earth scientists, physical scientists of many disciplines can use remotely sensed data. Like if you're looking at vegetation patterns, there are sensors that can give you information that is useful for that kind of discipline. There are people who are looking at how disease vectors change over time on the surface, say as areas are heating up or cooling down. That can change the plant distributions and that can change what kind of animals, you know, what kind of prey species, predator species exist in those areas. And some of those predator and prey species are disease vectors. So, by understanding how the land surface is changing, you can then also get an idea of, well, is this area going to be more vulnerable to a particular sort of disease? Less vulnerable? You know, things of that nature.  Host: And that sounds like that's something that happens over a very long period of time.  William Stefanov: It can.  Host: You're not seeing those changes in a day or a week.  William Stefanov: Usually not. Usually not.  Host: OK.  William Stefanov: But sometimes if you have an event like let's say a volcanic eruption or an earthquake or a large storm system comes through.  Host: Yeah.  William Stefanov: Changes the land surface dramatically. That can have equally dramatic changes in things like, oh, suddenly we're going to have a mosquito outbreak because a hurricane has just come through and now all these areas are flooded. Anything that serves as a little basin, you know, could be a mosquito outbreak.  Host: Standing water where mosquitos can breed.  William Stefanov: Exactly, exactly. And so that's something where remote sensing can be very useful for, because using the right kind of sensor, you can then create very quickly a map of where all those areas are. And get a better idea of what might happen in the next coming days or weeks.  Host: You mentioned that your background is geology. Fill that in for me, just a little bit and tell us about your professional background. Establish why you understand this, and I don't.  William Stefanov: OK. I've had a pretty twisty career path.  Host: Yeah.  William Stefanov: I started out school in Massachusetts and that's where I first became interested in rocks. I was like, you know, many kids. I loved dinosaurs and could name every one that was known at that time. But I also had a lot of streams running through my family's land. And in the streams, you -- streams are great because streams sample all the surrounding watershed. And so, you can find a whole bunch of different kind of rocks in the streams. And I just became very interested in, \"Oh, what are these different colored rocks? And what do they mean?\" And that's kind of what set me on the path to becoming a geologist. And so, then I moved to Arizona which is paradise for geologists.  Host: Yeah.  William Stefanov: Because there's, you know, not a lot of those pesky plants on top of things.  Host: Covering up the precious rocks.  William Stefanov: Exactly, exactly. So, you can easily see the rocks. So, I spent the next 15 years living in Arizona getting my graduate degrees and then also getting a job as an environmental consultant. So, I got training not just in the academic side of geology but also in the hands-on, practical -- you know, go to this property because we want to sell it and we need to find out what's on it, kind of geology. From there, then I went, stayed at -- that was at Arizona State University. And I stayed there after I got my PhD and then I became interested in ecological remote sensing. Because there was a project there called the Long-Term Ecological Research, Central Arizona, Phoenix site. It's part of the National Science Foundation.  Host: Yeah, OK.  William Stefanov: And they had established some new sites looking at cities because there was the recognition then that humans are significantly altering the surface of the planet and the best place to find out how humans do that is to look at cities. So, Phoenix and Baltimore were selected as the two parts of this network. And I was at that point with a, you know, shiny new PhD, I became the lead remote sensing scientist for the [Central Arizona Phoenix] [Long Term Ecological Research] CAP LTER project. And there I began to get an interest in not just the hard rock aspects of geology, but sort of the more soft rock aspects. How does the soil interact with the land surface? How does vegetation affect how the geological processes are operating in cities? And what are the environmental hazards associated with cities? From there, then I got an offer to come to JSC to work with the International Space Station program, training astronauts. While that was kind of a departure from what I had been doing, you know, how often do you get an opportunity to come and train astronauts?  Host: Yeah. To do anything.  William Stefanov: Exactly. And also, just to say, you know, \"Hey, I actually work on an actual space station.\" I've always loved science fiction since I was a kid, so that was also like, \"Wow, OK, there's really nothing wrong with this offer.\" So off I came to Houston and started working as a contractor for many years. But became involved with the Crew Earth Observations Project which is the group that -- since the ISS has been in orbit -- they are the ones who have trained astronauts both in taking imagery and also collecting it and archiving it for the public to use. And so, I was brought in due to my geological background and also ecological background as a staff scientist to help train the astronauts in those subjects. And over time I kind of eventually became the chief scientist for Jacobs Engineering, the company I was working for. And then as the ISS became recognized as a useful platform for other remote sensing instruments, then the perceived need to create a position for someone who could really lead a group in that phase of the ISS development.  Host: OK.  William Stefanov: Developing the ISS not just for astronaut photography but for other types of sensors. And I was the successful candidate for that position. And so that's when I became a federal employee.  Host: Remote sensing for parts of the spectrum beyond the visual part?  William Stefanov: Yes. Yes.  Host: And I want to make that point because we're going to talk about all of them. But I want to start with the visual. I want to start with the part that you and I and people who are listening to us can see. Crew Earth Observation's one of my favorite experiments on the space station. Since Expedition one, more than 19 years now, that's been underway. Give me the thumbnail sketch of what Crew Earth Observations is and what it's aimed to do.  William Stefanov: Well, it's actually -- it's the current version of something that astronauts have been doing ever since the Mercury missions. They have always taken cameras up and taken pictures of the Earth.  Host: Of course, they did.  William Stefanov: Because of course, it's super cool.  Host: You went where and didn't come back with any pictures?  William Stefanov: Right, right.  Host: Yeah.  William Stefanov: Exactly. And those initial missions, in fact, when we go to Skylab for instance, there was a mission on Skylab that collected some of the initial data that led to robotic sensor systems like Landsat that has been collecting data in various forms since 1972 and has kind of become kind of the workforce robotic remote sensing instrument collecting information about the planet. But originally it was astronaut photography that set the stage for that. So what Crew Earth Observations does is we task the crew to look at a variety of different kinds of targets, science targets, education targets, and these are targets that are submitted by external investigators. For instance, an investigator who's interested in looking at a particular volcano in South America. So that investigator submits essentially a small proposal to our team. We look at it, verify that this is something an astronaut photography can actually collect data for. And then we set up a target in our system. Every day the Crew Earth Observations team looks at where the ISS is going to be in its orbit for the next 24 hours to see what the crew has the potential to see. Then they filter that information for cloud cover, sun illumination, just verifying that, OK, if the crew takes an image of this, it'll be a good image.  Host: Not a picture of cloud tops.  William Stefanov: Exactly, not a picture of cloud tops, unless that's exactly what we're looking for.  Host: Right, OK.  William Stefanov: So, once we get through all that and then we also look at the crew's operational schedule to make sure there's nothing going on that's going to take their attention, like another experiment or if the ISS is being reboosted in altitude, because that changes where they can see, particularly for small targets. And then we send that up to the crew, so they can see it when they wake up the next day for their next work day. And then it's up to them to look at when those targets occur and decide whether they can go to a window and take an image. So, it's not -- we are what's called task listed. So, it's crew discretion as to whether they have the time and desire to go and take the images that we ask for.  Host: Makes it sound less a mandatory assignment than a wish list or a suggestion. \"Hey, if you have time to go take this picture.\"  William Stefanov: Exactly, exactly. And we found that most astronauts develop an affinity for doing this. So most of them will make time to go take the images, especially if it's something super interesting.  Host: Well, we've heard -- I know I've heard from a lot of astronauts who talk about how they get fixated on the view of Earth from that perspective, and they spend a lot of their free time in those windows just looking or taking pictures or shooting videos. And this is an extension of that. You're giving them specific targets to look at and to try to capture.  William Stefanov: Yeah.  Host: And I want to talk about some of the reasons why in a second. But in the broader sense, we can make that sound really simple. \"Hey, go to the window and take a picture.\" Do they have to use special cameras to do this?  William Stefanov: No, they don't.  Host: See, I think that's kind of remarkable.  William Stefanov: It is.  Host: Just an off the shelf camera, maybe it's got some long lenses or something. But something that I may have at home in the closet astronauts are using in space to take pictures of Earth with.  William Stefanov: You could absolutely have exactly the same kind of gear that the astronauts use on the ISS in your home.  Host: Cool.  William Stefanov: If you have the same long lenses it's going to be a lot harder for you to manipulate them in Earth gravity.  Host: Yeah.  William Stefanov: But yes, yeah, it's all commercial off the shelf equipment. And well, the current make of our cameras is Nikon. You know, I'm not supposed to be plugging.  Host: I asked you what is it, what are they using?  William Stefanov: Right, right. Right, that's the current brand of camera we're using. And periodically the photo TV group here will assess what is the best kind of camera, the best kind of commercial off the shelf camera to use. So, it's not -- there have been several different makes of cameras over the years.  Host: And you're talking about other specialists on the ground here in Houston who are experts on the equipment themselves.  William Stefanov: Yes. Yeah.  Host: They themselves are experts on the equipment.  William Stefanov: Yes.  Host: And these pictures get taken -- it could be any time during the astronaut's work day, or any time between wake up and bedtime?  William Stefanov: Yes, yes. And for some projects, occasionally under special circumstances we can also set up the cameras for timed imagery during their sleep period.  Host: Oh, OK.  William Stefanov: If there's something that's particularly of interest. There was a project that just completed called the Tropical Cyclone Project. And that frequently -- the crew had to set up the cameras on a timed basis because the cyclones they were interested in passing over happened to be during crew sleep. So that's a possibility too, but yes, we try to confine the targets to when the crew is actually up. We don't want them to wake up at, you know, 3:00 in their morning just to go take a picture.  Host: Right.  William Stefanov: But some crew members, if they're totally motivated, they will ask us to do that for them.  Host: How much time might they spend on this in a day?  William Stefanov: Typically, we allocate approximately a five-minute window for them to go and take the image. Because the ISS is traveling so fast, that's about all you need to take a specific image and then you're kind of past where you can take a good shot of it. And we try to limit the amount of targets per day to about three or four. Just one because we realize that this is not a must-do activity to the crew and they have other things to do.  Host: And they probably will get another chance.  William Stefanov: And they probably will. And they do.  Host: In another few days.  William Stefanov: And they do, quite frequently. And sometimes we'll give them a specific target and for whatever reason they may not go to the window exactly at that time. But they know what the target is, so they see it coming up again in a later orbit and they might take an image of it then.  Host: OK. The reasons why any particular target may be selected have got to vary. Because you said there are a lot of different scientists or researchers who are interested in these targets for many different reasons. Give me a sense of some of the reasons. And I think one of them I'm going to guess -- you mentioned a volcano. We're trying to record historical events, natural events. I'm not sure how to characterize that.  William Stefanov: The answer is yes, all of the above. All of the above.  Host: OK.  William Stefanov: Yeah, so the astronaut photography data set is the longest continual data set of remotely sensed data from orbit that we have. It's not continuous necessarily in space or time, but in terms of just duration of time covered, it's one of the longest duration time records that we have. So, some of our sites are continuing to collect imagery of sites that have been looked at from the days of Mercury. For instance, one long-term target that we have is the Toshka lakes in Egypt. And these are lakes that were formed due to an overflow of water from the Aswan Dam when it was created. And these lakes have gone up and down over the years. And you've had vegetation forming on the edges and things like that.  Host: Right.  William Stefanov: So, it's a very interesting environmental record of what happens when you have this human caused activity, this human caused event and how it affects the landscape. There's numerous glaciers that we've been looking at for many years, because those have -- most of them have been shrinking over time just as the atmosphere is warming.  Host: And they also move so very slowly that looking at them over a long time would give you a chance to see the movement.  William Stefanov: Exactly.  Host: So to speak.  William Stefanov: Exactly. And we have, as I mentioned earlier, so we've got a number of different science requests. Educators are very interested in collecting data for their students. And so, we have a whole separate proposal process for that where schools can send us requests for new imagery if they're interested in looking at a particular area. And this is something that astronaut photography in particular really excels at. Because it's intuitively understandable to someone. You know, in some cases it's similar to you taking a picture out of an airplane.  Host: Yeah.  William Stefanov: You don't necessarily need to be a remote sensing expert to understand what you're looking at in the astronaut image. And also, the fact that this is an image that was taken by a human being on a platform orbiting the planet has sort of an intuitive connection to a lot of people.  Host: Yeah.  William Stefanov: That's different from looking at an image taken by a robotic sensor. You know, just the fact that there was somebody behind the camera.  Host: Somebody with a live finger.  William Stefanov: Somebody with a live finger, exactly. Exactly. And we found that to be very powerful for educational purposes. But right now, right now the highest priority that we have for crew photography is actually disaster response from the International Space Station. Throughout the world there's an international charter that all countries that have sort of space-based assets have agreed to. It's colloquially known as the International Disaster Charter. And when something happens, say a volcano erupts or an earthquake occurs, or a cyclone impacts a coastal area, the country that's impacted can issue essentially what amounts to a call for help, call for data to help them deal with whatever happened in terms of disaster response, aid on the ground. And so, NASA has a program run out of headquarters, the NASA Earth Sciences Disaster Program that --  Host: I'm sorry, the Earth Sciences Disaster Program? OK.  William Stefanov: And JSC participates in that through the ISS program. So, when something happens and it's something that the crew can see, our group here, CEO team will notify the crew that this event has occurred. We'll put together a data package that helps them find where the area of interest is and gives them some background on what happened, what kind of data we're looking for? And then we send that up as a high-priority target to the crew. And if they get data back, it's downlinked to the ground. Our team here then fully georeferences the data. I should really explain what I mean by that.  Host: What Georeferencing is, yes.  William Stefanov: So, since we're talking about commercial off the shelf cameras, digital cameras that aren't -- they're not specifically designed as remote sensing instruments. So, when the astronaut takes a picture of the Earth, there's no inherent information in that image that tells you exactly where on the surface of the planet that is.  Host: To identify the target.  William Stefanov: To identify the target but also to enable you to drop that image onto say a map of the world, say like in Google Earth or a geographic information system. So, there's no -- the pixels of that image don't have any geographic information attached to them. So, in the past the way we've worked with this is we've taken the image, identified the image center point and then by looking at other information that is geographically registered, we can then assign the geographic center point to that image. So at least you have some idea where on the planet this image was from, but when you're talking about things like disaster response where you want to be able to lay an image down on top of a road network -- so you can tell exactly, \"Well, these streets are flooded. These houses are impacted. This is exactly where the landslide occurred.\" If you don't have fully georeferenced imagery, you can't really do that. And so, over the past couple of years we've developed a partnership with a group at Ames Research Center to develop a capacity to automatically fully georeferenced astronaut photography.  Host: Ooh.  William Stefanov: So, when it's downlinked, we know exactly where every pixel in that image is and then you can import it into something like Google Earth and it will lie on top of the surface correctly. And so, it's greatly enhanced. Primarily it's used for disaster response.  Host: And I take it then that the usefulness of this is that it gives people in the area where the disaster happened information about -- beyond what they can see with their own eyes and where they happen to be.  William Stefanov: Absolutely.  Host: And what needs to be done.  William Stefanov: Yes, exactly. Exactly, correct. And so, once we do all that, then we make that data available to the U.S. geological survey, and they put that into their hazardous data distribution system. They're the agency that actually delivers data to requesting -- to whatever the requesting entity was from another country. So, NASA doesn't do that directly through that process. And we also send the data to the natural disasters program as well for their use.  Host: OK. Imagery for disaster response. Otherwise, scientists doing research want pictures of stuff?  William Stefanov: Yes. Yes, they do. For a number of different disciplines.  Host: Yeah.  William Stefanov: For instance, there's been a lot of interest recently in atmospheric processes, things like lightning frequency, things like aurora and also air glow, sky glow on the planet. And there's actually been several peer-reviewed publications in recent years that have used astronaut photography to get at that kind of information. Because another advantage of the ISS is -- besides its particular orbit -- it's also the fact that you have humans who can hold these cameras at essentially any angle. So, the ISS can take imagery, what we call very oblique images. So instead of just looking straight down to where the ISS is, they can look out a window and take a far, sort of a far field image. And that's perfect for looking at atmospheric phenomena. Because you can pretty much -- it would be akin to flying in an airplane and you look out the window and you're looking at the cloud deck that you're right next to. And that's pretty much what the crew imagery --  Host: Seeing it go both above and below where your eye level is.  William Stefanov: Exactly.  Host: That slice of whatever your target is.  William Stefanov: Exactly, exactly. And so that's another piece of data that has been very useful in recent years to researchers. Another type of data or image that is becoming more and more popular both for general use and also for scientific purposes, is night time imagery. The cameras that we have on the ISS right now are optimized for collecting good night time imagery. So, imagery of cities at night have become very important to a lot of researchers because they're looking at things like light pollution studies. They're also looking at how changeovers from traditional or I'd say 20th century lighting like sodium vapor lamps or incandescent lamps are shifting over to LED type lighting solutions. And there are people who are asking, \"OK, what's that kind of light doing to things like nocturnal animals?\"  Host: OK.  William Stefanov: You know, is it affecting their patterns? We're involved in a project with Kennedy Space Center where they've changed over all of their site lighting to LED's and they were interested in how that would affect sea turtle migrations at night. And so, we collected some data for them. I can't tell you what the results are yet. I haven't seen them.  Host: Right.  William Stefanov: But that's something that they're looking at.  Host: I read too that part of what you can use these for is to document cosmic events. That seems like it's not stuff on the planet but it's a planetary transits or meteor showers, things like that?  William Stefanov: Yes. If the situation is correct, like the transit of Venus is something that has been documented by astronauts. Don Pettit when he was up there on one of his missions. He set up cameras in the Cupola so that he could record in a time lapse a series of the transit of Venus across the face of the sun.  Host: Nice.  William Stefanov: And meteors are something that the crew has taken both by accident -- we've seen sort of serendipitous information. But also, if there's a big meteor shower, they can set up cameras to take time-lapse imagery and see if they can see meteor events. That kind of brings up another sensor that was on the ISS recently called the meteor sensor. And that was in the WORF, the Window Observation Research Facility. And their whole purpose was to collect, record meteors entering the atmosphere. Because when they burn up, the sensor had a diffraction spectrometer on it. And that was just a way to split the light coming into the camera up into specific wavelengths so that they could get chemical information out of these bursts, these fireballs, if you will. And from that they could tell, get an idea of where that meteor originated from, what kind of parent body in the solar system it originated from. And so that operated quite successfully for a couple of years. And that was pretty much video information that was collected.  Host: Apparently, one source of targets too is a special request from Public Affairs Office. I've never made one, but I can imagine that that's, you know -- those people don't ever go away, right?  William Stefanov: No.  Host: [Laughs] No.  William Stefanov: No, we frequently get requests like that for big events like the Houston rodeo. We've had requests, \"Hey, can you take pictures of Houston for the rodeo?\"  Host: Oh, OK.  William Stefanov: So that we can link it up with social media type accounts. There have been requests for other events that have taken place around the world, say big conferences. We've gotten requests for that, \"Can you get an image of this to tie into that?\"  Host: Of a place so that we can give it to the people who are going to be at that place?  William Stefanov: Exactly, exactly. Exactly. So yeah, those kinds of requests come through not infrequently.  Host: I saw another reason that I found to be really interesting and I want to learn more about it. It says that doing surveys of this planet can fold into helping us do surveys of future places that we will go.  William Stefanov: Yes.  Host: How so?  William Stefanov: Yes. Well, there's a branch of science that we call analog science. And so, one class of target that we have had in the past for CEO for astronaut photography has been impact craters, meteor impact craters like Barringer Crater in Arizona. Probably a very well-known example. Because we see craters on many other planets a lot more than we see typically here on Earth. Because Earth is a geologically active planet, so it tends to weather its surface and it resurfaces itself on a constant basis. Whereas bodies like the Moon don't because there's no active tectonic activity going on. Right.  Host: A footprint that was put there 50 years ago is still there. Yeah.  William Stefanov: Exactly. Exactly. So, by looking at features like that on the Earth, looking at river channels on the Earth, we can then look at the surface of Mars and if we see similar features on the surface of Mars, we can then kind of come to the conclusion that, \"Oh, maybe those are also river channels.\" And that's what you do with analog science. You're looking at features on the Earth that we can find similar features on the planets. And if we understand how the surface, how the feature formed on the Earth, then that gives us a pretty good starting point to figure out what was going on on the other planetary body.  Host: Do you have any idea at all how many photographs have been gathered over -- just in the ISS years, in 19-plus years?  William Stefanov: Just for ISS imagery, we're now over three million images.  Host: Three million individual frames?  William Stefanov: Yes, individual frames. Yes.  Host: Many of these are available for people out there. Anybody who can touch the internet can see lots of them, right?  William Stefanov: Yes, yes. In fact, through our website, The Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth, we make that data set available to the public, to the global public. And you can search the entire database. You can download imagery. And you did touch on an important point, that we have over three million images. Only a relatively small fraction of those images have been cataloged. And by cataloged, I mean they have descriptive information added to them to help you search through them. So, for instance, what images are present in this -- or what features are present in this image? Like what city, what mountain range, what river? So, something else that we have done over the past several years is we have now brought the techniques of machine learning or artificial neural networks into our group.  Host: Yeah.  William Stefanov: And this is in essence -- this is teaching a machine to identify features in the image. And we've now started to put some of these on our website, images that have features obtained by machine learning. And these are things like cities. There are now several cities that once you train the machine to recognize what a particular city looks like, we can then run it through, have it look at the entire image catalog.  Host: Wow.  William Stefanov: And tag every image that it finds. So, we're now opening up a much larger set of images to the public that they can now search on through this technique. And that's pretty exciting. That's something that I know myself, I've been working to push the group towards for years.  Host: Yeah.  William Stefanov: And it's exciting to see it actually happening, that we have the technology to actually do that now.  Host: I am aware that people who are listening to the podcast are going, \"I would like to see the pictures too, Pat.\" Well, we've tried to make an arrangement for that. If you're checking the show notes in the episode pages here, we've posted some of the photos that Will, and I are going to look at and he's going to describe for us right now. And the first one we put up here is one of -- I will say a volcano, and I'll allow you to fill in the difference. But it is a remarkable picture from way above a dust cloud on a volcano.  William Stefanov: It is. This is Sarychev Peak in the Kuril Islands. And this is probably my favorite volcano image that the crew has collected, because there's a lot of stuff going on in it. That big -- the big sort of puffy cloud that you see dominating the image.  Host: Right.  William Stefanov: That's something called a pileus cloud. And that's formed when the volcano erupted -- it pushed a huge mass of air upwards, directly upwards very, very quickly. And when that happens, it condensed all the water that was in that air column right above it.  Host: Just because of the pressure?  William Stefanov: Just because of the pressure and the temperature.  Host: Wow.  William Stefanov: And pushing it up. And so, you get this immediate sort of puffball formation. And it doesn't last very long. In fact, that cloud dissipated seconds after this image was taken. In fact, if you look at the image, you can begin to see that the erupting material, sort of the ash and steam coming up from below is already starting to kind of penetrate the cloud.  Host: It's coming through the sides around the circumference.  William Stefanov: Yeah. Now this -- pileus clouds have been observed before. This wasn't like a novel phenomenon. But this was the first time that it had been seen from orbit and captured in this picture. So that by itself is exciting. You also see, if you look at the image, if you look at the volcano itself further down, you see another kind of whitish cloud, if you will, of material.  Host: On the side of the mountain.  William Stefanov: Basically, that's actually flowing down the side of the mountain. And so that's what we would call a pyroclastic flow. This is actually one of the most dangerous kinds of eruptions you can have and can basically engulf, you know, whole cities and towns. So, they're very dangerous. But this island is not heavily populated so there wasn't that much of a danger. And then the big hole that you see in the image, that actually caused quite a lot of discussion amongst the volcanologic community.  Host: Are you talking about the hole in the cloud?  William Stefanov: The hole in the cloud, yes. So, you've got the pileus cloud, you've got the island underneath and you've got this open space.  Host: I guess I assumed that the eruption and the pileus cloud caused the hole in the cloud.  William Stefanov: That's one -- that's one possible explanation.  Host: OK.  William Stefanov: Another explanation is that just because of the way wind patterns and the atmosphere acts around these islands during the day, you tend to have conditions set up where the moisture and temperature changes near the volcano itself, near the island, to where clouds don't form. So, you naturally get this ring of open area around the volcano. And so, there's are camps that said, \"No, that's what's going on.\" There were camps that said, \"No, it's the eruption that caused the temperature to change around here and that's why you don't see any water vapor.\" And it's not clear that there was a winner.  Host: In that debate.  William Stefanov: In that debate, in that debate. I think there's probably a combination of processes going on in there.  Host: That's cool. Let's look at the next one. There's another natural disaster. But this is -- I don't know, is that a hurricane at night? Or with a spotlight in the middle?  William Stefanov: That is -- sort of. This is a shot of Hurricane -- of Tropical Cyclone Bansi. And this was taken during darkness, so it was fairly -- not complete darkness but getting to be dark. And what you're seeing is you're looking right through the center of the cyclone. You're looking at the eye wall. And you're seeing thunderstorms and lightning going on inside the eye wall.  Host: Oh, OK.  William Stefanov: And this is also a very, very cool picture because the ISS was pretty much directly over the storm when this was taken. So, you can actually -- you can see -- you can look right through the storm.  Host: You can see water.  William Stefanov: You can see water. You're actually looking through the eye of the tropical cyclone. And you've got this illumination from lightning flashes going on around it.  Host: Nice. One more real quick. And I looked at the description of this, so I know what it is, but I couldn't figure it out on my own looking at it. What is a salt glacier?  William Stefanov: Ah. A salt glacier. That is -- well, glaciers, as --  Host: I thought glaciers are ice.  William Stefanov: Glaciers are ice. Yes. And so frozen water and glaciers flow because ice can flow over time. It turns out, salt can do the same thing. Salt is -- salt is not just on your table. Salt is a mineral. It's a naturally occurring form. It's called halite, sodium chloride. And under the right geologic conditions you can get large volumes of salt being deposited, sort of evaporating lake beds. And over geologic time, those salt layers can then be covered up by other materials, soils, rock, buried under hundreds of miles on the surface. And when that happens, salt has a lower density than the rock that's above and below it. So, if there's any -- and it wants to flow. It's not a solid rock. So, if there's anything that causes the rock above it to have any kind of crack or any weakness --  Host: It can flow through it.  William Stefanov: The salt will push it up.  Host: OK.  William Stefanov: And so, this is a tie-in back to Houston. Because if you look around the eastern Texas area and in the Gulf of Mexico, you see a lot of what are called salt domes. Mont Belvieu is a salt dome. High Island is a salt dome.  Host: The strategic petroleum reserve is there. Yeah.  William Stefanov: Exactly. Exactly. And they're domes because there's salt under them that's pushing them up.  Host: OK.  William Stefanov: Now the salt hasn't actually come to the surface at this point. It's like you're pushing your fist up under a rug or something and you're doming up the material on top of it. But in this case, in the Zagros Mountains of Iran where this is taken, the salt has actually flowed up through the rock to the surface and extruded itself on the top.  Host: OK.  William Stefanov: Kind of like toothpaste. And so enough of this has come up so through the central salt dome that you see in the middle, that the salt is on the surface and is now sort of flowing downhill if you will.  Host: Is this similar to a volcanic eruption? Stuff comes ups and through?  William Stefanov: It could be. It could be for a particular -- yeah, if you have a very, very viscous volcanic eruption.  Host: OK.  William Stefanov: It's kind of similar.  Host: It helps me visualize what we're talking about.  William Stefanov: Yeah, yeah.  Host: How it's working, yeah.  William Stefanov: So, what you're seeing here in this image is you're seeing all this salt on the surface and it's whitest kind of right near the central salt dome. That's where it's coming out.  Host: Yes.  William Stefanov: And also, you see it's very white in these stream channels that have been cut on the side, because that's exposed. The rest of it looks kind of brown.  Host: Looks like it dried.  William Stefanov: Not so much it dried. That's all just dust and things that have settled on top of it.  Host: Oh, OK.  William Stefanov: And so just like a glacier that's flowing downhill, the salt is now flowing downhill as well, and that's why have all these ridges being formed kind of around the edges. Because that's being formed as the salt is flowing and sort of separating along the surface. So yeah, this was a serendipitous image. We didn't ask the crew to collect this, but when I saw it, at first, I had the same reaction. I was like, \"Wow, what is that?\" And then I educated myself, \"Oh, it's a salt dome and it's a salt glacier.\"  Host: Yeah.  William Stefanov: It's like, wow, I've never seen one so well-developed. But there's actually several of these in the area.  Host: Cool. There are other experiments on the station that are aimed at the visual part of the spectrum. But I wanted you to talk about some of the other experiments that are not aimed at that. There are instruments on the station that are not taking pretty pictures for me to look at. What other kinds of science data is being gathered in this broad umbrella of Earth observations?  William Stefanov: A pretty wide range of different kind of data sets. The ISS is -- it's now pretty much fully developed as a remote sensing platform in that it can host a wide range of different kind of sensors. You know, we've talked about handheld camera imagery. But right now, we have sensors onboard that are hyper-spectral sensors. And by that -- we talked earlier about the electromagnetic spectrum and how there's regions of the electromagnetic spectrum that our eyes can't see but we can design sensors to look at that. So, what a hyperspectral instrument does is it looks at these different areas of the spectrum, of the electromagnetic spectrum, and collects data at very, very specific wavelengths through that spectral range. And when you do that, you can measure what the reflectance is, or you can think of it also as sort of the power return back to the sensor from the surface in each of these wavelengths. And different materials will have different spectra. Think of it as material fingerprints if you will.  Host: They reflect differently, and you can identify what that is down there by the amount of time it takes for a signal to transit?  William Stefanov: Not so much the amount of time but the degree of, the amount of reflectance it has in a particular wavelength.  Host: OK, in one area of the spectrum.  William Stefanov: Exactly.  Host: OK.  William Stefanov: Exactly. Exactly. And so, when you look at a whole range of these different wavelengths, you can develop a spectral curve. And different materials like certain minerals will have a very strong return in say .9 microns.  Host: Yeah.  William Stefanov: And it will have a very low return in .8 microns. And so, you can look for specific features, and they're very diagnostic of a particular mineral. So that's why I mentioned they can serve as fingerprints in a way. When you see these features in the spectrum, you're pretty sure, \"OK, that's this particular mineral that has that feature.\" So, there's two sensors onboard that have this capability. There's the [Hyper-Spectral Imager Suite] HISUI instrument which is a Japanese sensor that was a hyperspectral instrument that just went up on SpaceX 19.    Host: OK.        William Stefanov: And then there's also the [DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer] DESIS instrument which is a commercial sensor that's part of the [Multiple User System for Earth Sensing] MUSES platform. And that looks at imagery from -- or it looks at wavelengths from the visible through near-infrared spectrum. So very useful if we're looking at vegetation, some minerals. And now they're starting to look at it to see how well we can detect plastics.  Host: Plastics?  William Stefanov: Plastics in the ocean.  Host: Oh, like floating plastic mountains?  William Stefanov: Exactly, exactly. Yeah. I'm sure you've heard of the garbage patches in both the Pacific and Atlantic.  Host: Yeah.  William Stefanov: And so, the DESIS team has been looking at their data and they think that they've found a way to identify some of these plastics, these plastic garbage patches in their data. They're still doing research to kind to finalize that and confirm those results, but it's encouraging stuff. And so, we have those kinds of sensors onboard. We also have what we would all active remote sensing. That's a LDAR system, a laser system. Light detection and ranging. And that is the GEDI sensor. That's the Global Ecosystems Dynamics Investigation. And that is a sensor which is a laser pointed at the Earth. And what it's doing is it's collecting measurements of the vegetation canopy around the planet, forest cover, vegetation cover. And so that's the instrument where they're looking at time to return.   Host: Oh, OK.   William Stefanov: So, the laser is firing at the Earth's surface and the time that it takes that light to be reflected back up to the sensor is recorded. And the interaction --  Host: You need calculate the distance and know the height of the canopy.  William Stefanov: Exactly. But you could do more with this kind of instrument.  Host: But wait, there's more.  William Stefanov: But wait, there's more. By collecting enough data, you can also look at how often the light has bounced around, if you will, before it goes back up to the surface, or back up to the sensor. And so, you can not only just get an idea of the height of the canopy. You can also get an idea of what the structure of the canopy is underneath it.  Host: Wow.  William Stefanov: And that's what the GEDI team is doing. They're building this three-dimensional map of this canopy surface. And they're collecting this data over a couple of years.  Host: At least.  William Stefanov: At least. And the whole purpose of this is to look at how that canopy is changing over time as sort of vegetation patterns are changing. You know, how's that changing the amount of carbon biomass that we have above the surface? We also have sensors that are looking at the atmosphere. Not so much the ground surface but the atmospheric column above it, like the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 which is looking at the exchange of carbon dioxide between the land surface and the atmosphere. And that of course relates directly to things like greenhouse gases and atmospheric warming. And all these sensors -- and one other that I should have mentioned is something -- another new sensor that we've added to the ISS, new capability. There's also the eco stress instrument which is a thermal infrared or mid-infrared sensor that's collecting data in those wavelengths, longer wavelengths, essentially 7-13 microns. And what they're looking at specifically is heat stress in plants. Because in the thermal IR, when you're looking at a thermal image, quite frequently you'll be able to see where a plant is overheating as it were before you get a visible indication that the plant has some stress.  Host: I was wondering how you could see stress. Yeah.  William Stefanov: Yeah. Because I mean, anyone who's failed at having -- you know, raising houseplants or things, know that the first thing you see is you see the plant yellowing. And that's an indication obviously of stress. But in different wavelengths you can see indications of stress long before you see it visibly. And so that's what the eco stress sensor is looking at. And so, all of these sensors taken together have now produced what you could call an ecological remote sensing suite on the ISS. Because they're all collecting information that is of interest to ecological researchers and researchers looking at plant biology. Because they'll refer to different aspects of a plant. The hyperspectral instruments can tell you what the chemical makeup of the plant is. The eco stress can tell you what its health situation is like. And the OCO-3 can give you some idea of how that plant is actually functioning, how well it's exchanging oxygen and carbon with the atmosphere. And we can do this on a global basis. So, this is what really enables us ecological scientists to really get an idea of how the planet is functioning, breathing if you will.  Host: All these that you've just mentioned, this suite, they're all relatively new. They're not brand new, but they've been on station within the last year or two?  William Stefanov: Yeah. Within the last year or two, yep.  Host: Was it put together with all of that in mind, that these were all complementary or studying complementary areas that they all need to go to, that they all need to go together? Or was that luck?  William Stefanov: It wasn't complete luck.  Host: OK.  William Stefanov: But it was --  Host: You've got to take the luck whenever you can get it.  William Stefanov: Yes, yes, absolutely. Absolutely. I wouldn't say it was completely planned out as sensors have gone through the NASA proposal process and review process. Certainly, these teams are aware of other sensors going up, and so they could say, \"Hey, if we put this sensor up, it can serve as a complimentary data collection to this other sensor that we know is already either on the station or is going up on the station.\" But no, to my knowledge there was no pre-existing concerted effort to --  Host: No grand scheme?  William Stefanov: No grand scheme. No grand scheme in place.  Host: It occurred to me, being a not science guy, that you would get more information on the state of the tree canopies or the ground or whatever by being down on the ground and being closer to them in order to gather information. Yet all these instruments are doing that from a distance of 250 miles or so. Is it ideal to be able to observe these things from that distance? Or do those findings complement other data that you can gather?  William Stefanov: They definitely complement. As we kind of talked earlier, you get a bigger picture from orbit. And yes, you're exactly correct, when you're on the ground and you're actually measuring, you know, taking measurements from the tree canopy itself or actually measuring the girth of a tree or something, that's data that is still fairly difficult to get from our remote sensing instrument. But it's complementary. The remote sensing data enables you to extend those really detailed measurements that you get on the ground to a wider area. Because you can match -- say you're looking at a particular kind of tree or particular tree species, you can get the measurements that are important for that kind of tree -- say it's a broadleaf tree versus an evergreen. And once you know what those values are, you can look at the remotely sensed data and say, \"OK, I know that's an evergreen forest, so these are the kind of features, the kind of measurements I'm taking from an evergreen forest.\" You can then look at the rest of the data collected from other parts of the planet and say, \"Oh, that matches an evergreen forest.\" So, you can start extending your reach, the reach of your data, essentially. So yeah, the two definitely work together.  Host: And with these new instruments on the International Space Station, it should be able to contribute more of this complementary data to I guess a lot of different scientists who would be able to access it.  William Stefanov: Yes, yes. One thing for -- if it's a NASA-funded system on the ISS, then that data is publicly available. It's a federal mandate that it be so. Commercial sensors of course, well they're commercial sensors so you have to pay for those. And other international partner sensors tend to have some -- you know, they tend to also be publicly available maybe to different degrees than NASA does. But that data is also typically available for researchers at the very least to do work on.  Host: If somebody said, \"Tell me the most important thing about the International Space Station as an Earth observation outpost,\" what would you say to them?  William Stefanov: I'd say the most important thing for me is its orbit. The ISS has what's called an inclined equatorial orbit, in that it doesn't pass over the poles of the planet like other remote sensing instruments do.  Host: We're going around at the equator?  William Stefanov: We're going around at the equator. So, what this does, it enables the ISS to pass over different spots on the Earth at different times of day or night. And so, from the ISS you can collect what I would call a fundamentally different kind of dataset than you would from a polar orbiting satellite like Landsat. So, this does a couple things. It enables the ISS particularly for disaster response to be in the right place at the right time, literally for a crew member to look outside the window and see something happening. You know, \"Hey, that volcano's erupting. I should take a picture of that.\"  Host: Yeah, get a camera.  William Stefanov: It also allows the ability for some types of studies -- because the ISS has this orbit, it tends to spend more time over the equatorial regions of the planet as opposed to a polar orbiting satellite. So, for some studies that's of great importance, like the CATS sensor which was a previous -- Cloud Aerosol Transport System sensor, another LDAR system. They were particularly interested in looking at the equator because that was an area where they hadn't collected a lot of dense data from other polar orbiting sensors. And it's a very important region for looking at how aerosols are transported across the planet. Because that's one of the major transport routes. So, in that case the ISS was an ideal platform for their sensor to collect that kind of information. The other aspect is the fact that there's humans onboard.  Host: Right.  William Stefanov: I just alluded to it. A human being can make an on-the-fly decision, \"Hey, there's something interesting going on. I should record that.\" Or vice versa, \"OK, I know you want me to look at this area, but you know, maybe your predictions weren't quite correct and that's completely cloud covered so there's no point in me taking that image.\" You know, the crew member can make that decision.  Host: Yeah. Let's look at a couple last images.  William Stefanov: OK.  Host: That are also pretty stunning. This one, I think it was called -- I can't remember what it was called. Something about fishing in green.  William Stefanov: Oh yeah. Yeah, this is a spectacular image. And again, it kind of speaks to the cameras that we have onboard, which are quite good at taking that kind of imagery. Yeah, what you're looking at here is you're looking at the Gulf of Thailand. And so, in the center of the image you can see a city area that's kind of light whitish colored lights. That's Bangkok.  Host: Bangkok.  William Stefanov: And in the Gulf of Thailand directly below it and to the left --  Host: The west.  William Stefanov: To the west, yes. I believe that's west, yes.  Host: Yeah.  William Stefanov: You see all these green lights. And what all those green lights are, those are lights on fishing boats. And the very cool story behind the fishing boats is that those green lights attract fish to the surface. And so, these are all fishermen out there. But they're not after the fish. They're after the -- they're after the squid that are eating the fish.  Host: Let's follow the fish.  William Stefanov: Right. And so, they're actually squid fishing, or squid farming, squid fishing. And so that's -- so you see here, you see a very interesting use of how humans have used the electromagnetic spectrum to their advantage because they know this green light is what attracts the fish, and then attracts the squid.  Host: Yeah, if you think that a green light on a fishing boat might not be visible from the International Space Station, but there's got to be hundreds, if not thousands of green lights in this picture.  William Stefanov: Yep, yep. Yep, it's --  Host: All clustered together.  William Stefanov: It's a local industry.  Host: One more. Talking about evidence of man on the surface of Earth, here's a picture of Dubai where clearly that's a manmade thing.  William Stefanov: Yes. Yes. Yeah, what you're looking at here, this is the Palm Jumeirah development from Dubai. And this is something that astronauts, ever since it's been visible, this is something that astronauts always key in on because it's so evident. Yeah, what you're looking at is a manmade archipelago that was created by dredging of material, sand from the sea bottom and building up these islands. And I think for the Palm Jumeirah there, you're talking about over 50 million cubic meters of material that was dredged up to form those.  Host: Wow.  William Stefanov: The other one that you can see off to the right, the one that sort of looks like -- vaguely looks like a map of the world -- that's because it's exactly what it was meant to be.  Host: What it was meant to be, yeah. OK.  William Stefanov: And that's hundreds of millions of cubic meters to form that one. And I believe that's called the World Islands development. So, this speaks to -- this speaks very, very evidently to how humans can reengineer their environments. This is an area that's like, \"Well, this was open water and we just decided, hey, we want to create some new islands here.\" And so that's what we did.  Host: I got some time. I've got the money to do it.  William Stefanov: I've got some time, got some money, yep.  Host: Remind me again where anybody can try to search and look for these pictures themselves?  William Stefanov: This is a site called the Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth. So, you can Google that, and if you want the actual address, it's https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov.  Host: I think they're actually slashes, not backslashes.  William Stefanov: Slash, slash.  Host: But anyway, Gateway to Astronaut Photography.  William Stefanov: Yep.  Host: That's where you'll find it.  William Stefanov: That'll get you there, yes.  Host: Will Stefanov, this is terrific. Thank you very much for educating me. I appreciate it.  William Stefanov: It's been my pleasure. Thanks for inviting me.  [ Music ]  Host: If there is an upper limit on the amount of time one person can spend online looking at pictures of Earth taken from space, I haven't found it. But I vow to keep searching. For more than 19 years now, the International Space Station has provided a platform for people and the machines that they've made and control to keep an eye on their planet for scientific advancement, for self-sustainability and for just the joy of discovery. You and you and you and you, you're all invited to join in. Point your internet machine at one of these websites and you can get lost in your own planet. Eol.jsc.NASA.gov is the Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth. You heard Will Stefanov mention it. That's where astronaut photography from all crewed missions is posted. Space station, space shuttle and more. Another, esrs.jsc.NASA.gov/esrs is the site for the Earth Science and Remote Sensing Unit. They have information on current, past and planned sensors that are posted on the International Space Station. One more, issearthserv.jsc.NASA.gov. That's the space station instrument integration interface. It's a search tool for multiple International Space Station data sets.

        description: '>> HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST. WELCOME TO THE OFFICIAL PODCAST OF THE NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, EPISODE 6: THE MOST AWESOME PODCAST FROM SPACE. I’M GARY JORDAN, AND I’LL BE YOUR CO-HOST TODAY, ALONG WITH DAN HEWITT. DAN, WHAT’S UP? >> HEY, GARY. TODAY’S EPISODE WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT, BECAUSE WE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH JACK FISCHER, A US ASTRONAUT, WHILE HE WAS IN SPACE. AND WE DID THE WHOLE THING LIVE, SO WE BROUGHT IN SOME SOCIAL MEDIA QUESTIONS REAL TIME, AND JACK WAS ANSWERING THEM. >> THAT’S RIGHT, IT WAS A WICKED AWESOME DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT IT’S LIKE TO LIVE IN SPACE, WORK ON SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS, AND SEE THE EARTH BELOW WHILE YOU’RE TRAVELLING AT 17,500 MILES PER HOUR, WATCHING THE SUN RISE AND SET 16 TIMES A DAY. SUCH A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE OF THE PLANET. SO, WITH NO FURTHER DELAY, LET’S GO LIGHT SPEED AND JUMP RIGHT INTO OUR TALK WITH COLONEL JACK FISCHER. ENJOY. [ MUSIC ] >> T MINUS FIVE SECONDS AND COUNTING. MARK. [ INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ] >> WE HAVE A PODCAST! [ MUSIC ] >> IT’S REAL GOOD TO BE BACK. I WAS ON THE FIRST EPISODE, AND I’M NOT THE EXPERT-- WE ARE TALKING TO THE EXPERT IN SPACE TODAY. IT’S SUPER EXCITING, AND AGAIN, JUST WRAP YOUR MIND AROUND THAT-- WE’RE ABOUT TO TALK TO SOMEBODY IN OUTER SPACE. >> I-- YEAH, HOW COOL IS THAT? IT’S CRAZY! I MEAN, WE’RE LOOKING AT HIM RIGHT NOW GETTING SET UP. THIS IS CRAZY. I MEAN, FOR ME PERSONALLY, THIS IS MY VERY FIRST TIME TALKING TO SOMEBODY IN SPACE. >> THAT’S RIGHT, GARY’S NEWER HERE, SO HE HASN’T HAD THE PRIVILEGE. I’VE BEEN HERE A LITTLE BIT LONGER, AND I’VE DONE IT MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE STILL, BUT IT’S STILL REALLY EXCITING. IT MAKES YOU A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS, BUT IT’S REALLY COOL TO LIVE IN A TIME WHERE WE HAVE THE CAPABILITIES TO TALK TO SOMEBODY WHO’S IN OUTER SPACE, FLYING AROUND US AT 17,000 MILES AN HOUR. I MEAN, ONE OF THE COOLEST EXAMPLES I CAN THINK OF THAT HAPPENING-- AND IT SHOWS YOU JUST HOW FAR WE’VE COME. I MEAN, IT USED TO BE YOU NEEDED SATELLITE DISHES AND TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAD MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF ALL OF THESE THINGS JUST TO TALK TO SOMEBODY A FEW HUNDRED MILES AWAY. AND NOW, YOU COULD TALK TO SOMEBODY IN SPACE ON A CELL PHONE. IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO US ONCE. WE WERE OVER IN KAZAKHSTAN, AND WE HAD JUST WATCHED ONE OF THE CREWS LAUNCH TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. AND IT HAD BEEN A COUPLE OF HOURS, THEY WERE ALMOST DOCKED, AND WE WERE HEADING TO AN OLD THEATER IN BAIKONUR TO GO WATCH THE ACTUAL DOCKING OF THE CREW MEMBERS GET THERE, AND ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES’ PHONES RANG. AND HE ANSWERED IT, AND YOU COULD JUST SEE HIS FACE LIGHT UP. AND IT WAS JUST A REAL SHORT CONVERSATION-- “OH, YEAH, NO, THAT SOUNDS GREAT. SOUNDS COOL, YEAH. WE’LL DEFINITELY USE THAT.” THAT WAS IT-- HE HUNG UP. AND HE SAID, “THAT WAS THE COMMANDER OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. HE JUST CALLED ME ON MY CELL PHONE TO TELL ME HOW HE WAS SETTING UP A CAMERA TO WATCH THE CREW MEMBERS COME ONBOARD.” SO I MEAN, JUST THAT BLEW MY MIND, BECAUSE WE WERE JUST IN THIS REMOTE PART OF THE PLANET, AND HE COULD GET A PHONE CALL FROM SOMEBODY IN SPACE. LIKE, IT’S JUST SO INCREDIBLE THAT WE’RE LIVING IN THIS TIME. AND WE’RE ABOUT TO TALK TO SOMEBODY IN SPACE. IF YOU CAN’T TELL, I’M REALLY EXCITED. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I KNOW GARY IS, TOO. >> YEAH, VERY, VERY TRUE. IT’S JUST CRAZY TO PICK UP A BOX AND THEN LITERALLY, IT IS SPACE CALLING. I’VE HEARD STORIES OF, YOU KNOW, ASTRONAUTS CALLING PIZZA JOINTS AND ORDERING PIZZA FOR SOME COLLEAGUE WHOSE BIRTHDAY IT WAS, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IT’S JUST THE MOST INSANE THING TO THINK ABOUT. BUT OKAY, SO TODAY, WE’RE TALKING WITH SOMEBODY IN SPACE-- JACK FISCHER. >> YES. >> LET’S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HIM. WHO IS THIS GUY? >> SO JACK FISCHER IS ONE OF THE FLIGHT ENGINEERS FOR EXPEDITION 52. HE’S BEEN ONBOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION SINCE APRIL, SINCE HE LAUNCHED WITH THE RUSSIAN COSMONAUT FYODOR YURCHIKHIN. JACK IS ONE OF THE RELATIVELY NEWER ASTRONAUTS IN THE CORPS. HE WAS SELECTED BACK IN 2009, AND THIS IS HIS FIRST SPACEFLIGHT, SO THIS IS HIS FIRST TIME IN SPACE. AND HE’S BEEN UP THERE FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS NOW. HE’S GOT A STEM BACKGROUND LIKE ALL OF THE ASTRONAUTS DO-- DEGREES IN AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING, AERONAUTICS AND ASTRONAUTICS-- A LOT OF A WORDS IN THERE. AND HE WENT TO MIT, SO HE’S GOT A PRETTY NICE RESUME TO MAKE HIM AN ASTRONAUT. BUT HE WAS ALSO IN THE AIR FORCE-- HE’S AN AIR FORCE COLONEL WITH 3,000 FLIGHT HOURS AND MORE THAN 45 DIFFERENT AIRCRAFT. AND HE WORKED IN A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT JOBS BEFORE HE EVER FLEW INTO SPACE. AND ALL THE ASTRONAUTS DO THAT-- THEY’RE EITHER SUPPORTING DIFFERENT TECHNICAL PROGRAMS HERE AT NASA-- JACK WAS A CAPCOM, SO HE WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY TALKS TO ASTRONAUTS EVERY SINGLE DAY. >> OH, WOW. >> SO YOU KNOW, FOR PEOPLE LIKE THAT, TALKING TO SOMEBODY IN SPACE IS THEIR JOB, IT’S OLD HAT. FOR US, IT’S SUPER UNIQUE, BUT… HE’S DONE ALL THOSE THINGS, AND NOW HE’S BEEN ONBOARD FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, AND HE’S BEEN DOING EVERYTHING FROM SPACEWALKING, TO SCIENCE, TO CAPTURING VISITING SPACECRAFT-- KIND OF THE WHOLE GAMBIT OF STUFF. >> UNBELIEVABLE! OKAY, SO HE’S-- YOU KNOW, NOW HE’S GOT THAT EXPERIENCE, RIGHT? HE’S GOT NOT ONLY THE FLIGHT TIME JUST IN PLANES, BUT NOW HE’S GOT FLIGHT TIME TRAVELLING 250 MILES ABOVE THE EARTH REALLY, REALLY FAST. SO HE’S GOT-- SO HOW ARE HIS SPACEWALKS? WHAT’S THAT? >> YEAH, SO HE DID TWO SPACEWALKS. AND EVERY ASTRONAUT WILL TELL YOU THAT SPACEWALKS ARE ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE, ONE OF THE MOST DYNAMIC THINGS THEY GET TO DO. IT’S KIND OF ONE OF THE COOLEST THINGS ABOUT BEING IN SPACE A LOT OF TIMES. AND HE DID TWO BACK IN MAY. ONE, THEY JUST REPLACED A COMPONENT ON THE OUTSIDE, AND THE OTHER ONE WAS SOMETHING WE CALL AN UNPLANNED SPACEWALK, WHERE SOMETHING BROKE AND THEY HAD TO GO OUTSIDE AND REPLACE IT. AND SO HE DID BOTH OF THOSE WITH PEGGY WHITSON, WHO’S BEEN UP THERE WITH HIM THE WHOLE TIME. HE AFFECTIONATELY REFERS TO HER AS THE SPACE NINJA. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE IS THE ALL-TIME RECORD HOLDER FOR AMERICAN ASTRONAUTS FOR TIME IN SPACE, SO DEFINITELY A GOOD PERSON TO HAVE UP THERE WITH YOU ON YOUR FIRST TRIP. >> FOR SURE. [ LAUGHTER ] AWESOME. OKAY, SO WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING TO JACK FISCHER HERE IN JUST A FEW MINUTES. IF YOU ARE TUNING IN ON FACEBOOK LIVE, WE ARE ACTUALLY MONITORING THE QUESTIONS RIGHT HERE, AND GOING TO ANSWER THEM AS THEY COME ALONG, MAYBE EVEN SEND A COUPLE UP TO JACK ONCE WE GET STARTED HERE. SO WE HAVE A COUPLE HERE COMING IN ALREADY. WE HAVE FOLKS CHECKING IN FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. I SEE SOME FROM ITALY. I SEE SOME FROM, OBVIOUSLY, HERE IN THE STATES. SO EVERYONE, WELCOME. I DID SEE ONE QUESTION, ACTUALLY, BEFORE WE EVEN STARTED THIS ONE. THIS ONE IS FROM KELLY, AND SHE SAID HER FIVE-YEAR-OLD WAS ASKING IF SOME OF THE ASTRONAUTS WATCH MOVIES ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. >> THEY DO, THEY DO. WE DO LIKE TO EQUIP THEM WITH SOME OF THE KIND OF CREATURE COMFORTS OF BEING BACK HERE AT HOME. >> COOL. >> AND ONE THING THEY HAVE UP THERE IS THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY SMALL PROJECTOR, AND THEN A LARGE SCREEN-- I THINK IT’S ABOUT 40 INCHES OR SO-- AND THEY’LL HAVE MOVIE NIGHTS. AND WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE A PICTURE. >> AW, LOOK AT THIS! >> AND THIS IS ALL SIX CREW MEMBERS. THEY USE BUNGEE CORDS TO KIND OF MAKE LITTLE LEAN-TO HAMMOCKS, AND EVEN BREAKING OUT THEIR SLEEPING BAGS TO GATHER TOGETHER AND WATCH MOVIES IN SPACE. A LOT OF THEM WILL TELL YOU THEY LIKE TO WATCH A LOT OF SPACE MOVIES, JUST BECAUSE, I MEAN, THEY’RE UP THERE, THEY’RE LIVING IT. >> SURE. >> BUT IT’S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT KIND OF MAKES LIVING IN SPACE A LITTLE MORE LIKE BEING BACK HERE AT HOME. BECAUSE, I MEAN, YOU’RE IN A REALLY STRANGE PLACE. >> IT’S TRUE. >> I MEAN, YOU’RE COMPLETELY ISOLATED FROM EVERYBODY EXCEPT FOR THE TWO OR FIVE PEOPLE WITH YOU. SO HAVING THINGS LIKE MOVIES CAN MAKE THAT TIME A LOT EASIER. >> NOW, IT SEEMS LIKE COMRADERY HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF LIVING IN SPACE, TOO-- JUST GETTING ALONG WITH YOUR CREWMATES AND DOING STUFF TOGETHER. I KNOW-- I GUESS THEY WATCH MOVIES TOGETHER, AS WE JUST SAW IN THAT PICTURE, BUT I KNOW THEY EAT MEALS TOGETHER, TOO. >> OH YEAH, THEY DO. AND THEY’RE TOGETHER FOR YEARS BEFORE THEY EVER FLY. THEY’LL USUALLY BE WITH-- YOU’LL BE WITH THE SAME PEOPLE PRETTY MUCH THROUGHOUT ALL YOUR WORK TIME FOR TWO YEARS BEFORE YOU FLY IN SPACE WITH THEM. SO THEY KNOW EACH OTHER VERY WELL BEFORE THEY FLY. MEALS ARE DEFINITELY ONE OF THOSE-- SO IT’S AN INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, SO THERE’S A LOT OF INTERNATIONAL FOODS. SO THEY LIKE TO COME TOGETHER AND SHARE LITTLE CREATIONS. THE FOOD’S NOT QUITE AS GOURMET AS IT MIGHT BE DOWN HERE ON EARTH, BUT THEY DO HAVE A COUPLE OF WAYS TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE INTERESTING-- THEY LIKE TO PUT HOT SAUCES AND THINGS LIKE THAT ON A TON OF STUFF, JUST BECAUSE YOUR TASTE ACTUALLY CHANGES WHEN YOU’RE IN SPACE. AND THAT’S DUE TO ALL THE FLUIDS RUSHING UP, AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF CRAZY THINGS HAPPEN, BUT-- >> WOW. >> YEAH. >> ALL RIGHT, WELL, IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS FOR JACK, JUST PUT THEM IN THE COMMENT SECTION. WE’LL KIND OF FOLLOW ALONG AND EVEN-- HE’S GETTING SET UP HERE RIGHT NOW, BUT ONCE WE START CONNECTING WITH HIM IN JUST A FEW MINUTES HERE, WE’LL READ THOSE QUESTIONS UP TO HIM. BUT PERSONALLY, FOR ME, I MEAN, BESIDES JUST YOU READING HIS BIO, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I’VE MET JACK. I’M-- THE FIRST TIME I’M ACTUALLY GOING TO BE TALKING TO HIM. >> SO JACK-- HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOLLOWING HIM ON SOCIAL MEDIA. HE’S BROUGHT JUST AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF EXCITEMENT TO EVERYTHING THAT HE’S BEEN DOING. AND AGAIN, HE’S A FIRST TIMER, SO HE’S BEEN EXPERIENCING ALL THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SHARING IT WITH PEOPLE AS HE DID. I ACTUALLY GOT TO MEET JACK THREE YEARS AGO. WE WERE BOTH DOWN IN FLORIDA FOR ORION’S FIRST SPACEFLIGHT, EFT 1. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE PUT ORION, OUR NEXT GENERATION SPACECRAFT, INTO OUTER SPACE. AND HE WAS BASICALLY ASSIGNED TO BE OUR VOICE FOR THE ENTIRE AGENCY. SO HE WENT AROUND TALKING TO THE MEDIA, ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE TO TELL THEM ABOUT ORION. AND AGAIN, HE JUST BRINGS THIS LEVEL OF ENTHUSIASM. HE’S GOT A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR. HE’S INCREDIBLY KNOWLEDGEABLE, SO HE’S GOING TO BE GREAT FOR THIS, THE MOST AWESOME PODCAST FROM SPACE. SO I’M SUPER EXCITED. >> ABSOLUTELY. APPROPRIATELY NAMED, TOO. THAT’S WHAT WE’RE GOING TO BE CALLING THIS EPISODE. SO WE’LL TALK TO HIM RIGHT NOW. THIS WILL BE OUR LIVE EPISODE THAT WE’LL BE DOING HERE. YOU’LL BE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH US LIVE, BUT THEN IT’LL BE AVAILABLE ON iTUNES, SOUNDCLOUD, AND NASA.GOV-- THE RECORDED AUDIO VERSION AFTER THIS. I GUESS TOMORROW WE’LL POST IT. SO THERE’LL BE A FULL TRANSCRIPT WITH THAT AS WELL. SO RIGHT NOW-- >> WE’RE 20 SECONDS AWAY. >> OH, OKAY. >> WE’RE ABOUT 20 SECONDS AWAY. GARY, ARE YOU READY? ARE YOU READY TO TALK TO SPACE FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME? >> I THINK SO, I THINK SO. >> ARE YOU READY? OKAY, EVERYBODY, LET’S GET READY FOR GARY. THIS CAN BE A LITTLE NERVE-RACKING, I ASSURE YOU, BUT-- [ LAUGHTER ] JUST A COUPLE OF SECONDS. >> OKAY, SO WE’LL WAIT FOR THE CALL FROM MISSION CONTROL HOUSTON HERE, AND START TALKING TO JACK SOON. >> STATION, THIS IS HOUSTON. ARE YOU READY FOR THE EVENT? >> I SURE AM. >> JSC PAO, THIS IS MISSION CONTROL HOUSTON. PLEASE CALL STATION FOR A VOICE CHECK. >> STATION, THIS IS GARY JORDAN AND DAN HEWITT HERE FOR “HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST.” HOW DO YOU HEAR ME? >> LOUD AND CLEAR, GARY AND DAN. GREAT TO BE WITH YOU TODAY. >> AWESOME. WELL, I AM EXTREMELY EXCITED ABOUT THIS EPISODE, BECAUSE AS I WAS TELLING DAN HERE BEFOREHAND, THIS IS-- USUALLY WHEN WE HAVE A GUEST, THEY’RE IN THE STUDIO, LET ALONE ON THE PLANET. SO I’M GOING TO START OFF THIS CONVERSATION BY ASKING SOMETHING THAT I LITERALLY CANNOT ASK ANYONE ELSE: HOW’S LIFE IN SPACE TODAY? >> IT’S AWESOME, LIKE IT IS EVERY DAY! AND WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO-- JUST BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS YOUR FIRST GUEST FROM SPACE-- EVERY SINGLE QUESTION, I’M GOING TO GO ON A DIFFERENT WALL. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I’LL BE ON THE WALLS, I’LL BE ON THE CEILING. I’M GOING TO ADJUST ORIENTATION MID-INTERVIEW AT EVERY QUESTION, JUST BECAUSE I CAN, AND IT’S COOL. I LOVE IT. OKAY, AWESOME. SO YOU’RE USED TO SPACE NOW. YOU’VE BEEN UP THERE FOR-- WHAT IS IT-- ALMOST FOUR MONTHS. >> YEAH. >> SO I MEAN, WHEN YOU’RE GOING TO BE SWITCHING FROM WALL TO WALL, DO YOU SORT OF GET DISORIENTED, OR IS YOUR BODY USED TO IT AT THIS POINT? >> NAH, IT KIND OF FIGURED IT OUT PRETTY QUICK, AND YOU KNOW, THAT’S WHAT’S SO AWESOME ABOUT THE HUMAN BRAIN. WE COME UP HERE IN A COMPLETELY FOREIGN ENVIRONMENT, AND THE BRAIN’S JUST LIKE, “MAN, ALL THIS VESTIBULAR-- ALL THESE THINGS THAT I NORMALLY USE TO FIGURE OUT WHICH WAY’S UP AND TO ORIENT THIS BODY FOR THIS DUDE DOESN’T WORK. SO I HAVE TO FIND A DIFFERENT WAY.” SO IT FORCES YOUR MIND AND YOUR BODY TO GROW AND TO LOOK AT THINGS DIFFERENTLY. SO YOU START LOOKING THREE-DIMENSIONALLY AT EVERYTHING AROUND YOU, AND IT’S AMAZING HOW QUICKLY YOUR BODY CAN ADAPT AND JUST GET USED TO IT. ALL RIGHT, THAT WAS QUESTION ONE-- I’VE GOT TO SWITCH NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] >> ALL RIGHT, WELL, WHILE YOU DO THAT, I MEAN, THAT JUST KIND OF LEADS INTO WHAT IS DIFFICULT TO GET USED TO WHEN YOU GET UP THERE? BECAUSE I MEAN, IT’S A COMPLETELY ALIEN ENVIRONMENT FROM WHAT WE GROW UP AND YOU SPEND YOUR ENTIRE LIFE EXPERIENCING. WHAT’S TOUGH ABOUT IT? >> ABSOLUTELY, AND YOU KNOW, IT TOTALLY DEPENDS ON THE PERSON. AND WE CAN’T REALLY PREDICT, EVEN DEPENDING ON YOUR BACKGROUND. I COME FROM A TEST PILOT BACKGROUND, AND YOU KNOW, CAN DO THINGS IN AN AIRPLANE THAT WOULD MAKE A BILLY GOAT PUKE, BUT THAT DOESN’T MEAN THAT WHEN I GET UP HERE I’M GOING TO BE ANY BETTER THAN A SCIENTIST WHO’S NEVER BEEN IN A PLANE. IT’S NOT A GOOD PREDICTOR. I WAS LUCKY, AND WHEN I GOT UP HERE I DIDN’T HAVE CONGESTION, OR UPSET STOMACH, OR ANY OF THOSE BIG PROBLEMS THAT SOME PEOPLE DEAL WITH. BUT EVERYBODY HAS TO LEARN HOW TO FLY. AND SO AS A TEST PILOT, I WAS PROBABLY WORST THAN MOST, BECAUSE YOU KNOW, MOST PEOPLE FIND A WAY TO TRANSLATE AND FLY FROM POINT TO POINT AND JUST BE HAPPY WITH IT. BUT FOR ME, EVERY DAY I’VE GOT TO TRY SOMETHING NEW, SO I WOULD REALLY SUCK AT IT, AND RUN INTO STUFF, AND HIT MYSELF INTO THINGS. AND THAT WASN’T GOOD, BUT THEN I’D GET BETTER. AND THEN I’D TRY SOMETHING MORE OR I’D TRY GOING FASTER, AND IT WAS LIKE THIS CYCLE. SO NOW, I’M DOING PRETTY GOOD, BUT IT WAS A LONG AND BUMPY ROAD, AND DON’T ASK PEGGY HOW MANY THINGS I KNOCKED OFF THE WALL. >> OH, I MEAN, WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT EARLIER, SO YOU’VE GOT PEGGY WHITSON UP THERE-- THE SPACE NINJA, AS YOU LIKE TO CALL HER. I MEAN, ARE THERE ANY CRAZY MOVES THAT YOU’VE BROKEN OUT AND SHE’S LOOKED AT YOU AND SAID, “JACK, NO, STOP. DON’T DO THAT AGAIN.” >> OH, MY GOSH, SO MANY TIMES. SHE HAS A PATENTED LOOK. IT’S THE, “2FISH, YOU ARE CRAZY” LOOK, AND I’VE PRETTY MUCH GOT THAT DOWN. WHEN I GET THE PEGGY WHITSON “2FISH, YOU’RE CRAZY” LOOK, THEN I KNOW, OKAY, THAT ONE I’VE GOT TO STOP. >> SO I MEAN, WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED? I MEAN, NOW YOU’VE BEEN IN SPACE WITH PEGGY WHITSON FOR THIS LONG-- WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED FROM HER THAT YOU SORT OF TAKE WITH YOU? AND THEN I GUESS KIND OF OFF OF THAT, WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED THAT REALLY SORT OF ANNOYS HER THAT YOU REALLY LIKE TO DO? [ LAUGHTER ] >> WELL, WE’RE LIKE TWO PEAS IN A POD. WE GIVE EACH OTHER A HARD TIME ALL THE TIME, SO WE TEASE EACH OTHER A BUNCH. WE HAVE A GOOD TIME. BUT I’M VERY-- I JUST CAN’T EVEN SAY HOW LUCKY I AM TO HAVE BEEN ON ORBIT WITH NOT ONLY PEGGY, BUT ALSO FYODOR YURCHIKHIN, MY COMMANDER AND FRIEND IN THE SOYUZ, AND THE COMMANDER OF THE STATION NOW. THOSE TWO HAVE SO MUCH EXPERIENCE THAT I LEARNED EVERYTHING FROM THEM. THEY-- YOU KNOW, NOT JUST THE BIG STUFF OF HOW TO ORGANIZE YOUR DAY AND HOW TO BE EFFICIENT AND THOSE TYPE OF THINGS, BUT EVEN THE LITTLE STUFF. AND I-- EVERY TIME THEY’RE AROUND, MY EYES ARE WIDE OPEN. YOU KNOW, HOW IS PEGGY CUTTING HER FOOD PACKET? BECAUSE IT’S PROBABLY THE BEST WAY, BECAUSE SHE’S DONE IT QUITE A FEW TIMES. SO HOW IS FYODOR HOLDING HIS CAMERA? WHAT SETTINGS IS HE USING FOR THIS TASK? TO JUST WATCH THEM AND JUST SOAK THAT IN, GOSH, I AM SO LUCKY TO HAVE BEEN UP HERE WITH THESE TWO AND JUST SOAK IN ALL THEIR GOODNESS AND KNOWLEDGE. >> AND YOU’VE BEEN WORKING SIDE BY SIDE WITH THEM FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. JUST WALK US THROUGH REAL QUICK WHAT’S JUST SOME OF THE STUFF YOU’RE DOING UP THERE? BECAUSE IT’S A LOT MORE THAN JUST FLYING AND STUFF LIKE THAT. YOU’RE DOING SERIOUS EXPERIMENT WORK UP THERE. >> OH, ABSOLUTELY. THE SPACE STATION IS JUST THE MOST AMAZING, WORLD-CLASS LABORATORY FLOATING AROUND, DOING SCIENCE ALL DAY, EVERY DAY. WE’RE DOING SCIENCE INSIDE. WE’RE DOING SCIENCE OUTSIDE. LET ME TURN THIS OFF REAL QUICK. I’VE GOT TO-- WE’RE GETTING AN ECHO, SO I DON’T WANT YOU TO HEAR ME TWICE-- THAT’S WAY TOO MUCH. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THE SPACE STATION-- FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN SPACEX 11 CAME UP, IT HAD 6 TONS OF SCIENCE, MOSTLY SCIENCE ONBOARD, THAT THEN WE HAD TO BRING ONBOARD, KNOCK OUT THAT SCIENCE, GET IT BACK ON THE SPACEX AND BACK TO EARTH. THAT’S THE JOB OF THIS PLACE, IS JUST ROCKING THE SCIENCE. WE’RE DOING NOT ONLY STUFF FOR HUMAN HEALTH AND THOSE TYPE OF SCIENCES-- THERE WAS A GREAT EXPERIMENT THAT PEGGY WAS WORKING ON THE OTHER DAY WITH A NEW DRUG THAT ACTUALLY FINDS, TARGETS CANCER CELLS. WE’RE GROWING LUNG CANCER TISSUE, AND IT WAS DOING SOME GREAT WORK AGAINST THE CANCER. HOW COOL WOULD THAT BE IF WE COULD CRACK THE CODE OF THAT HORRIBLE DISEASE THAT EVEN MY DAUGHTER FELL PREY TO? SO NOT JUST THOSE-- WE’RE LOOKING-- JUST TEN FEET FROM ME IS A MACHINE CALLED THE ELF THAT’S LOOKING AT NEW WAYS TO CREATE ALLOYS THAT ARE LIGHTER, THAT ARE STRONGER. I MEAN, THIS WHOLE PLACE, EVERY SQUARE INCH IS DEDICATED TO EITHER PURE SCIENCE OR THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE GOING TO KEEP US AND THOSE SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS CRANKING AWAY AND GETTING GREAT RESULTS BACK TO EARTH TO HELP HUMANITY, TO MAKE HUMANITY BETTER, AND TO ENABLE US TO EXPLORE AND GO FURTHER INTO THE UNIVERSE. >> THAT SOUNDS INCREDIBLE. I’M SURE-- I MEAN, BESIDES ALL THE SCIENCE, YOU HAVE A LOT OF-- I GUESS-- I DON’T KNOW ABOUT A LOT OF CHANCES, BUT YOU DO HAVE THE CHANCE TO SORT OF LOOK OUT THE WINDOW AND SEE THE EARTH GO BY. SO WE DO HAVE A FACEBOOK QUESTION FROM [ INDISTINCT ]: “HOW DO WE LOOK FROM ORBIT?” I DON’T KNOW IF YOU’RE-- WHENEVER YOU’RE TAKING PICTURES OF THE EARTH, I DON’T KNOW IF YOU CAN ACTUALLY ZOOM DOWN AND GET SO CLOSE THAT YOU CAN START TO SEE PEOPLE OR ARE YOU THAT FAR UP? >> WELL, WE’RE PRETTY FAR UP. IF WE HAD A BIGGER LENS, WE COULD PROBABLY SEE YOU, BUT THE BIGGER THE LENS, THE SMOOTHER YOU HAVE TO BE. FYODOR COULD PROBABLY DO IT-- I CAN’T DO IT. SO THE BIGGEST THAT I’VE BEEN USING IS AN 800 MILLIMETER LENS, AND WE CAN GET ABOUT TO HOUSES AND SEE HOUSES. SO THAT’S ABOUT AS FINE DETAIL AS WE CAN SEE. SO WE’RE NOT LOOKING IN YOUR WINDOW AND SPYING ON YOU, I PROMISE. [ LAUGHTER ] >> WELL, THAT’S GOOD TO KNOW, BUT I’M SURE-- I MEAN, YOU SEE-- YOU’RE TRAVELLING SO FAST AROUND THE EARTH, YOU GET TO SEE SO MUCH OF IT. IS THERE ANY SORT OF PLACES ON EARTH THAT REALLY STAND OUT TO YOU THAT YOU REALLY LIKE TO EITHER GAZE AT OR KIND OF TAKE PICTURES OF? BECAUSE YOU SEE SO MUCH OF IT IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. >> YOU BET. THERE ARE PLACES THAT KIND OF BLEW ME AWAY FOR SURE THE FIRST TIME I SAW THEM. THE BAHAMAS ARE JUST-- THE BLUE IS JUST RIDICULOUS. I DON’T EVEN KNOW-- IT’S HARD TO BELIEVE IT’S REAL. ONE OF FYODOR’S FAVORITE PLACES IS KAMCHATKA, WHICH IS KIND OF A LITTLE PHALANGE OFF THE TOP END OF RUSSIA. THERE’S ALL THESE GREAT VOLCANOES THAT ARE JUST INCREDIBLE LOOKING. SO THERE’S A LOT OF PLACES THAT ARE WONDERFUL, BUT WHAT I’VE REALLY TRY TO DO, AND IT’S PROBABLY WHY I DON’T HAVE PICTURES OF SPECIFIC PLACES LIKE MY HOMETOWN IN COLORADO, LOUISVILLE, OR THOSE PLACES, IS BECAUSE I KIND OF GO TO THE WINDOW AND LET GOD SHOW ME WHAT-- SHOW ME THE TOUR AND I’VE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED. YOU COULD BE FLYING OVER THE SAHARA AND YOU’LL SEE THESE BRIGHT REDS AND A MOUNTAIN RIGHT NEXT TO SAND, OR A SANDSTORM, AND THEN YOU’LL BE IN THE HIMALAYAS AND YOU’LL SEE THESE INCREDIBLE MOUNTAINS. EVERY TIME I LOOK OUT THE WINDOW I’M JUST IN AWE AT HOW BEAUTIFUL THE EARTH IS. SO MY FAVORITE PLACE-- EARTH. >> GOOD ANSWER. ALL RIGHT, WELL, YOUR ACROBATICS ARE MAKING A LOT OF PEOPLE JEALOUS AND WE’RE ACTUALLY GETTING IN A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT, SO I WANT TO SWITCH GEARS REAL QUICK. SO WE’VE HAD A LOT OF NEWS, A LOT OF STUFF OUT THERE. WE JUST HIRED A NEW GROUP OF ASTRONAUTS-- OR A NEW ASTRONAUT IN CANADA SAID THEY’RE GOING TO BE REPORTING SOON. AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT WAS WHEN THEY GOT THE CALL, WHEN THEY GOT THE CALL THAT THEY’RE GOING TO COME BE AN ASTRONAUT. BUT I DON’T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER, BUT I WAS ACTUALLY WITH YOU SHORTLY AFTER YOU GOT THE CALL THAT YOU HAD GOT-- YOU HAD GOTTEN ASSIGNED TO A MISSION.. SO I HAVE TO ASK, WHICH ONE WAS MORE EXCITING, YOU’RE GOING TO BE AN ASTRONAUT, OR, “HEY, IT’S TIME TO GO FLY IN SPACE”? >> BOY, THAT’S TOUGH. PROBABLY THE “YOU’RE GOING TO BE AN ASTRONAUT” NOT BECAUSE YOU TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT YOU’LL FLY, BUT IT’S JUST ONCE YOU’RE AN ASTRONAUT YOU GOT A REAL GOOD CHANCE THAT YOU’RE GOING TO FLY. BEFORE THAT, AND TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT, WHEN PEOPLE ASK, “HOW DO YOU BECOME AN ASTRONAUT?” WELL, I’LL GIVE YOU THE ADVICE THAT MY DAD GAVE, “DARE TO DREAM.” SO ONLY YOU CAN DEFINE YOUR OWN DREAM, TO FIND YOUR PASSION, THE THING THAT REALLY MAKES YOU GO, BECAUSE ONCE YOU FIND THAT YOU’RE GOING TO WORK HARD AT IT, AND THAT’S WHAT THE DARE PART IS. NOBODY’S GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU. YOU GOT TO WORK REALLY HARD TO MAKE THAT PASSION AND THAT DREAM A REALITY. BUT THEN, THERE’S ONE MORE PART OF IT, AND TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST PARTS OF IT IS JUST SHEER LUCK, TIMING, AND I AM JUST LUCKY. THERE ARE TONS OF PEOPLE MORE QUALIFIED THAN ME THAT ARE BETTER THAN ME IN EVERY SINGLE WAY, BUT MAYBE THAT ROUND OF INTERVIEWS THEY DIDN’T APPLY OR THEY WEREN’T IN THE RIGHT PLACE IN THEIR LIFE THAT THEY COULD APPLY. I JUST GOT LUCKY TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND BE A PART OF AN INCREDIBLE GROUP. SO MY ADVICE FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT, FIND YOUR PASSION SO THAT YOU NEVER WORK A DAY IN YOUR LIFE, WORK REALLY HARD AT IT, AND THEN EVEN IF IT DOESN’T WORK OUT BECAUSE YOU WEREN’T LUCKY AT THE RIGHT TIME TO BE SELECTED AS AN ASTRONAUT YOU’RE STILL DOING WHAT YOU LOVE AND YOU’RE MAKING A BIG DIFFERENCE ON THIS PLANET. >> WELL, JACK, I DON’T THINK YOU GIVE YOURSELF ENOUGH CREDIT. I THINK, LIKE, YOU’RE AN EXTREMELY HARD WORKER AND YOUR PASSION IS DEFINITELY REFLECTED ON EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO. ESPECIALLY US, WE REALLY ENJOY WATCHING YOU ON ORBIT. BUT FOR FOLKS WHO WANT TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT YOU CAN ACTUALLY GIVE THEM A SENSE OF SORT OF WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE. AND I KNOW THERE’S A LOT OF-- THERE’S A LOT OF HARD WORK AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS YOU HAVE TO LEARN, BUT THERE’S ALSO THAT ELEMENT-- THE HUMAN ELEMENT OF BEING IN SPACE, OF LIVING IN SPACE. SO I HAVE A QUESTION JUST ABOUT, DO YOU EVER FEEL ISOLATED? DO YOU EVER FEEL AWAY FROM THINGS? OR ARE YOU SORT OF CONNECTED? AND THEN, I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FROM FACEBOOK FROM KAY, ASKING IF YOU HAVE INSOMNIA IN SPACE? THERE TWO SORT OF RELATED QUESTIONS, NOT REALLY, BUT THAT FEELING OF BEING IN SPACE. [ LAUGHING ] >> OKAY, I’M GOING TO HAVE TO FLIP MID QUESTION BECAUSE THAT’S REALLY TWO QUESTIONS. >> YEAH, YEAH. >> SO I’LL DO THE FIRST ONE QUICKLY. THE INSOMNIA ONE, SOME PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME SLEEPING IN SPACE, I DON’T. MY BACK USUALLY KIND OF HURTS ON THE GROUND BECAUSE I’VE BEEN FLYING FIGHTERS FOR TOO LONG, BUT UP HERE, I FEEL GREAT. SO IT’S LIKE SLEEPING ON AN AIRBED BECAUSE, WELL, I’M FLOATING ON AIR, SO THAT’S AWESOME, OKAY? NOW, I GOT TO FLIP. ISOLATED-- YOU DO FEEL A BIT, NOT BECAUSE THERE’S NOT CONNECTIVITY WITH THE GROUND. WE CAN CALL VIA AN INTERNET PROTOCOL PHONE, AS WELL AS VIDEO CHAT SOMETIMES, AND THEN WE’RE IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH THE GROUND ALL THROUGHOUT THE DAY. AS FAR AS FEELING ISOLATED, SOMETIMES YOU FEEL BECAUSE EVERYTHING YOU’RE DOING IS BEING WATCHED-- AND I’M NOT TALKING ABOUT A PODCAST OR POSTING ON TWITTER OR ANY OF THOSE TYPE OF THINGS. EVERYTHING WE DO AS WE’RE DOING SCIENCE AND AS WE’RE DOING ACTIVITIES IS BEING WATCHED BY THE CONTROL CENTERS WORLDWIDE THAT ARE KEEPING THIS PLACE RUNNING. AND SO, YOU CAN KIND OF FEEL LIKE, “MY, GOSH!” BECAUSE YOU’RE GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES. YOU CAN’T GO FOR SIX MONTHS DOING 12 HOURS A DAY AND NOT MAKE MISTAKES. YOU’RE GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES AND SOMETIMES YOU FEEL LIKE, “MAN, EVERYBODY IS SEEING EVERYTHING THAT I’M DOING WRONG.” LIKE, YOU HAVE A BAD DAY. THAT’S WHEN I BREAK INTO MY EMERGENCY COFFEE STORE AND GET ANOTHER COFFEE POUCH OUT SO I CAN HAVE SOME COFFEE AND THEN THINGS GET BETTER. >> ALL RIGHT. WE ONLY GOT A COUPLE OF MINUTES LEFT SO IT’S TIME TO GET INTO SOME OF THE DEEP STUFF, THE DEEP CUTS HERE. SO, YOU’VE BEEN UP THERE FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS, HAS JUST YOUR PERSPECTIVE ABOUT EVERYTHING-- ABOUT LIFE ON EARTH, ABOUT LIFE IN GENERAL, ABOUT YOUR JOB, ABOUT ALL OF THAT-- HAS BEING IN SPACE CHANGED THAT? LIKE, DO YOU HAVE THE OVERVIEW EFFECT YET? >> YOU KNOW, YOU DO, BECAUSE YOU GET TO SEE THE WORLD IN THIS TOTALLY DIFFERENT LIGHT, THIS WORLD WITHOUT BORDERS. ONE SHARED EXPERIENCE FOR EVERYBODY, AND THE BEAUTY, AND JUST THAT THIN BLUE LINE THAT IS SO FRAIL THAT HOLDS ALL OF LIFE. YOU JUST-- YOUR PERSPECTIVE HAS TO GROW, AND ADAPT, AND CHANGE TO THAT. BUT LIKE I MENTIONED EARLIER, HOW QUICKLY YOUR BRAIN ADAPTS AND GROWS, I THINK THAT PERSPECTIVE HELPS YOU GROW AS WELL. AND THAT’S WHY AFTER THIS EXPERIENCE, YES, MY PERSPECTIVE HAS CHANGED, BUT IT IS REALLY INSPIRED ME TO TRY TO GET MORE PEOPLE THIS EXPERIENCE AND TO GET A PERMANENT FOOTHOLD IN THE STARS FOR OUR SPECIES. I THINK WE’RE ON THE VERGE OF THAT. AND WITH ORION AND SLS, OUR NEW HUGE ROCKET, WE’RE TAKING STEPS TOWARDS THAT, AS WELL AS THE COMMERCIAL INDUSTRY, A BURGEONING COMMERCIAL INDUSTRY, THAT’S BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR US TO PRESS FURTHER INTO THE GALAXY. SO I’M-- MY PERSPECTIVE CHANGE IS THAT I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY CAN TO HELP THE HUMAN SPECIES, HUMANITY AS A WHOLE, GO FURTHER AND GROW AND EVOLVE LIKE I KNOW THEY’RE CAPABLE OF. >> AMAZING. THAT’S-- IT’S JUST SUCH AN INCREDIBLE PERSPECTIVE. I MEAN, JUST-- I MEAN, LOOKING DOWN AND JUST REALIZING KIND OF WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH, IT’S KIND OF AMAZING. BUT I GUESS FROM THERE, DO YOU EVER-- DO YOU EVER SORT OF MISS EARTH? OR MAYBE EVEN I GUESS HERE’S A QUESTION FROM GERALD DEAN, “DO YOU EVER MISS GRAVITY?” >> OH, SOMETIMES. THE OTHER DAY I WAS DOING A TASK AND MY WRENCH, LIKE, POPS OFF THE BOLT AND IT GOES FLYING OFF, AND I’M LIKE, “OH, NO BIG DEAL. IT’LL HIT THE WALL AND COME BACK TO ME.” AND I LOOK OVER AND THERE’S THIS GAP ABOVE THE RACK, AND IT’S LIKE-- IT’S LIKE AN INCH. AND THAT WRENCH DECIDED, “OH, I’M GOING TO TURN SO I’M PERFECTLY IN LINE WITH THAT GAP.” AND IT WENT FLOATING INSIDE AND THEN IT WAS BEHIND THE RACK AND LOST FOREVER. PROBABLY IN LIKE TWO YEARS, SOMEBODY’S GOING TO BE CLEANING AN AIR VENT AND GO, “OH, HEY, LOOK, A WRENCH. I WONDER WHERE THAT CAME FROM.” SO, THERE ARE SOME TIMES YOU REALLY MISS GRAVITY, BUT ABOUT 99.9% OF THE TIME YOU DON’T. >> ALL RIGHT, WELL, I MEAN, FIRST OFF, I JUST WANT TO SAY I FULLY SUPPORT YOUR NEW PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE I WANT TO GO TO SPACE, SO, JACK, DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO GET ME UP THERE. SO, YOU’RE GETTING CLOSE TO COMING HOME. YOU’RE COMING HOME THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER. IS THERE ANYTHING LEFT ON THE LIST THAT YOU WANT TO DO WHILE YOU’RE UP THERE? IS THERE LIKE A SPACE BUCKET LIST BEFORE YOU COME BACK? >> THERE IS, AND THERE’S-- IT’S SUCH A HUGE LIST, YOU CAN KIND OF GET OVERWHELMED BY IT. I WANT A PICTURE OF THIS, OR THAT, OR-- I’VE MADE A LIST AND I SAID, “I’M NOT GOING TO ADD ANYTHING ELSE TO IT. “SO, I’M ALMOST THROUGH IT, AS FAR AS THE STUFF I WANT TO TAKE PICTURES OF OR RECORD OR GRAB. AND THEN, I’M GOING TO TAKE ALL OF MY SPARE TIME AND JUST GO DOWN AND GRAB A WINDOW OR WHATEVER AND SIT THERE AND SOAK IT UP AND JUST ENJOY IT AND TAKE A MENTAL IMAGE SO THAT I CAN FUEL THAT PASSION. AND WHEN I COME BACK TO TRY TO TALK TO PEOPLE AND GET THEM EXCITED ABOUT SPACE, IT-- THERE’S A BIG OLD WELL OF PASSION INSIDE ME BECAUSE I JUST SAT THERE AND PLUGGED INTO THE INSPIRATION BAR IN THE CUPOLA. YOU LOOK OUT, ESPECIALLY-- NOT JUST DOWN AT EARTH BUT OUT TOWARDS THE STARS, AND IT CAN’T HELP BUT MAKE YOU SO EXCITED THAT THERE’S SOMETHING ELSE OUT THERE THAT WE’RE GOING TO GO, AND EXPLORE, AND I CAN’T WAIT. >> WOW. JUST, JACK, THIS HAS BEEN SUCH AN INCREDIBLE FEW MINUTES WITH YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ACTUALLY TAKING THE TIME TO TALK WITH US, AND TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS FROM FACEBOOK LIVE, AND TO SPEND THIS TIME WITH US. HONESTLY, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE. IF I HAD TO PIN IT INTO A PHRASE, AND THIS IS JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, I’D PIN IT AS SOMETHING LIKE A TRIPLE DECKER, FULLY LOADED BURGER OF AWESOME, BETWEEN TWO PERFECTLY TOASTED AWESOME BUNS. >> NAILED IT. NAILED IT. >> AND THAT’S-- THAT’S JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. BUT AGAIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SPENDING THIS TIME WITH ME, AND BEST OF LUCK TO YOU ON THE REST OF YOUR MISSION. >> WELL, THANKS A LOT. I’LL TRY TO SAY GOODBYE WHILE I’M SPINNING. IF I RUN INTO SOMETHING YOU CAN LAUGH. BUT THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME BE A PART OF THIS AND I HOPE EVERYBODY THAT’S IN THE PODCAST UNIVERSE HAD A GREAT TIME. PLEASE, IF YOU GET EXCITED ABOUT SPACE, NASA.COM. WE HAVE SO MANY RESOURCES, SO MANY WAYS THAT YOU CAN GET ENGAGED, WHETHER YOU’RE A TEACHER, A STUDENT, JUST A GUY ON THE STREET, PLEASE CHECK IT OUT. >> WOW. SO INCREDIBLE. >> STATION, THIS IS HOUSTON ACR, THAT CONCLUDES THE EVENT. >> THANK YOU ALL PARTICIPANTS WITH JSC PAO. WE’RE NOW RESUMING OPERATIONAL COMM. >> ALL RIGHT. WOW. >> OH, MAN. >> SO, WE JUST TALKED TO SOMEBODY IN SPACE. >> THAT WAS REALLY COOL. >> THAT WAS REALLY COOL, RIGHT. HOW COOL IS THAT? >> WOW. I JUST-- I REALLY JUST APPRECIATE HIS ENERGY, YOU KNOW? >> OH, YEAH. >> JUST THE LIFE THAT HE ADDS. IT’S NOT JUST LIKE A CONVERSATION, “THIS IS WHAT I’M DOING.” >> YEAH. >> NO, HE’S TRULY PASSIONATE ABOUT BEING IN SPACE AND PRESSING FORWARD ON NASA’S MISSION, IT TOTALLY COMES ACROSS IN EVERYTHING HE DOES. >> HE IS. IT’S JUST-- IT’S STILL SURREAL, BECAUSE I MEAN, WE’RE-- FOR EVERYBODY WATCHING, YOU CAN SEE WE’RE-- WE WERE LOOKING AT JACK ON A TV. >> YEAH. >> I MEAN, IT LOOKS LIKE HE’S FIVE FEET AWAY FROM US. >> RIGHT. >> WHEN IN REALITY, HE’S PROBABLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANET RIGHT NOW, FLYING AROUND. LIKE, HERE WE ARE TALKING TO HIM, SO I-- IT’S SO COOL. >> OH, WOW. >> AND WAY TO NAIL THAT CLOSING-- WAY TO NAIL THE GOODBYE, GARY. I’M VERY PROUD OF YOU. >> IT WAS JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. >> JUST THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD. >> AWESOME. WELL, HONESTLY, YOU CAN-- SO, EVERYTHING-- HONESTLY, JACK IS A REALLY COOL PERSON TO FOLLOW ON SOCIAL MEDIA. >> YES. >> IF YOU EVER GO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER, OR INSTAGRAM, WHICH YOU SHOULD, FOLLOW @ASTRO2FISH. THAT’S HIS-- THAT’S HIS HANDLE, RIGHT. HE SHARES ALL THESE DIFFERENT PHOTOS OF WHAT HE’S DOING, ALL THE EXPERIMENTS HE’S DOING, PHOTOS OF EARTH, AND HE’S JUST SUPER ENGAGED IN THE MISSION. YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING HE’S DOING THERE. REALLY AN INCREDIBLE THING TO FOLLOW. IF YOU JUST WANT TO FOLLOW EVERYTHING ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION WE HAVE THOSE TOO, @ISS, I THINK IS-- OR @SPACE_STATION. >> YEAH, THERE’S A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SITES YOU CAN FOLLOW. AS HE SAID, IT’S NASA.GOV FOR PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING NASA’S DOING. >> YEAH. >> AND IF YOU’RE INTERESTED IN THE SPACE STATION, IT’S NASA.GOV/ISS. WE’RE ALL ACROSS SOCIAL MEDIA-- FACEBOOK, TWITTER, AND INSTAGRAM. THOSE NAMES ARE ALL A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT, BUT IT’S ALL RELATED TO THE SPACE STATION. AND WE ALWAYS LIKE TO GET QUESTIONS ON EVERYTHING, SO USE #ASKNASA AND WE’LL TO AS MANY AS WE CAN. AND SINCE I DON’T WANT TO MAKE GARY DO HIS OWN SHAMELESS PLUG, “HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST.” IT’S INCREDIBLE. IF YOU’RE EVER WANTING TO GO BEHIND THE SCENES WITH THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT HAPPEN, THAT’S WHERE YOU GET IT. YOU GET THE DEEP DIVES, YOU GET THE EXPERTS, YOU GET THE FULL THING, AND I OCCASIONALLY GET TO COME IN AND DO FUN STUFF LIKE THIS, SO IT’S A BLAST. >> IT’S TRUE. WE’VE TALKED TO SOME REALLY COOL PEOPLE SO FAR, YOU BEING ONE OF THEM, OF COURSE, DAN. BUT ALSO-- >> I WAS THE GUINEA PIG. >> BUT WE HAVE TALKED TO THREE ASTRONAUTS SO FAR. WE HAVE JUST-- JACK FISCHER TODAY, BUT ALSO RANDY BRESNIK, WHO’S UP IN SPACE RIGHT NOW, AND WE ALSO GOT TO TALK TO SHANE KIMBROUGH, LIKE, TWO DAYS AFTER HE LANDED AND HE GAVE THAT WHOLE EXPERIENCE. BUT THEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE, WE TALK ABOUT SPACE FOOD, WE GOT A LOT MORE COOL EPISODES COMING UP SO STAY TUNED. YOU CAN FIND ALL OF THOSE ON iTUNES SOUNDCLOUD AND NASA.GOV, LIKE DAN SAID. SO I THINK THAT’S GOING TO WRAP UP, UNLESS THERE’S ANYMORE QUESTION-- WELL, I’M SURE THERE’S A LOT OF QUESTIONS, BUT WE’LL SAVE THOSE FOR-- ACTUALLY, YOU COULD TWEET #ASTRO2FISH. HE MIGHT ANSWER A COUPLE OF THOSE FOR YOU. AWESOME. WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TUNING IN TODAY FOR THE FIRST LIVE RECORDING OF “HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST.” THAT’LL DO IT FOR US HERE AND HOPE YOU KEEP LISTENING TO US IN THE FUTURE. IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS ON WHAT WE SHOULD PUT ON THE SHOW, PUT IT IN THE COMMENTS OR USE THE HASHTAG #ASKNASA. THANKS SO MUCH. [ MUSIC ] >> HOUSTON, GO AHEAD. >> I’M ON THE SPACE SHUTTLE. >> ROGER, ZERO-G AND I FEEL FINE. >> SHUTTLE HAS CLEARED THE TOWER. >> WE CAME IN PEACE FOR ALL MANKIND. >> IT’S ACTUALLY A HUGE HONOR TO BREAK THE RECORD LIKE THIS. >> NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY, BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD. >> HOUSTON, WELCOME TO SPACE. >> HEY, THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND. SO, WE ALREADY KIND OF PLUGGED EVERYTHING THAT WE NEEDED TO PLUG. WE TALKED ABOUT WHERE YOU CAN FOLLOW JACK FISCHER, WHERE YOU CAN FOLLOW THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, ASK QUESTIONS, DO ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF. SO THE ONLY THING I’LL ADD IS THAT THIS PODCAST WAS RECORDED ON AUGUST 10th, 2017. THANKS TO ALEX PERRYMAN, JOHN STOLL, TOMMY GRESIK, PAULA VARGAS, CHARLES GLENN-DANIEL, GREG WISEMAN, ROB NAVIAS, AND OF COURSE DAN HUOT. THANKS AGAIN TO COLONEL JACK FISCHER FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. WE’LL BE BACK NEXT WEEK.',

        description: "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston We Have a Podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 88: The Heroes Behind the Heroes. I'm Pat Ryan, your host for a special edition of the podcast. Ordinarily, we talk to NASA scientists, and engineers, and astronauts, and others about the cool stuff they're doing right now, but this time, we're going to veer off that course a bit, and let me tell you why. Several months ago, I was in a regular meeting where we talk about stories the NASA Public Affairs Office in Houston could or should do, and, well, you know how meetings can get. I suddenly snapped to a story that one of my coworkers was pitching. It had to do with a university professor from Dallas and some of his students who had worked with voice recordings of the flight control team in Houston during the first Moon landing, and they had to make use of an enormous piece of ancient audio equipment that has lived in one of the rooms here in our production facilities for years. It's a big, green monster that I have never, ever seen in operation, even one time. Well, the more he told of the story, the more it struck me as a terrific mystery. Well, not exactly a whodunit, but maybe a how they do that, or they did what? Well, you'll see as we go along. So I talked to him more after the meeting, and we agreed to try to produce this story for the podcast. His name is Greg Wiseman. He's one of the audio engineers in the Media Production Services Department here at JSC. And you'll hear him as part of the ensemble of voices that we're about to unleash on you. What's coming up now is the story we flesh out, starting with Greg's recollection, plus podcast interviews I did with 8 people who lived the story, and narration by me as a means to tie all the pieces together. So to invoke the spirit of Gary, here we go with the story of the rescue of the audio of the Apollo 11 Mission Control Center.  [ Music ]  Host: A regular by-product of the work done by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is the creation of pieces of history. It's a natural occurrence when your job description is to do things that have never been done before. I'll wager that you've heard some of the highlights before.  Neil Armstrong: Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.  Charlie Duke (Capcom): Rocket Tranquility, we copy on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.  Host: And this bit, which came just hours later.  Neil Armstrong: That's one small step for man. One giant leap for mankind.  Host: But it's a lot less likely that you've heard this bit of history before.  Flight Director: T2 stay/no stay, all flight controllers. T2 stay/no stay. RETRO?  RETRO: Stay.  Flight Director: FDO?  FDO: Stay.  Flight Director: Guidance?  Guidance: Stay.  Flight Director: CONTROL?  CONTROL: Stay.  Flight Director: Telcom?  Telcom: Stay.  [ Unintelligible ]  Flight Director: EECOM?  EECOM: Stay.  Flight Director: Surgeon?  Surgeon: Stay.   Flight Director:  Capcom we’re stay for T2.  Host: Or this one.  Jack Schmitt: Excuse me Fred.  Fred Haise: Yeah.   Jack Schmitt: This is Jack Schmitt  Fred Haise: Yeah.  Jack Schmitt: Say, is John around?  Fred Haise: John who?  Jack Schmitt: John Young?  Fred Haise: No, he's not here.  Jack Schmitt: I was just wondering. I'd like to get a in flight, somebody who's looked at it before opinion so people are--  Host: Those first 2 clips came from Apollo 11, the mission that put the first human beings on the surface of the Moon. The second 2 clips also came from Apollo 11, and there's a story behind how we have them available for you to hear. It's the story of how a small group of dedicated scientists and engineers saved part of America's spaceflight history while they were trying to build machines that could better understand us when we talk.  Like most good stories, this one does not go in a straight line from Point A to Point B. That would be the shortest distance between the 2 points, but not necessarily the most interesting trip. This narrative runs into unexpected developments. And the way the characters in the story deal with those roadblocks is as much a part of the lesson as is their achievement of their original goal. The story involves elements of sophisticated analytics and engineering and other stuff that I find interesting as hell, even though I can't do the math on my own. It also has important and exciting world history. And near the end, we'll tell you how you can access that history on your own. The story has 2 beginnings on unrelated tracks -- Points A and B, I guess -- which merge with one another in 2013 at Point C and then move forward.  [ Music ]  One track begins in Plainfield, New Jersey near the dawn of the Space Age with the birth of a smart and curious boy who would grow up to earn a bachelor's degree with highest honors from Rutgers and then a master's with highest honors and a doctorate from Georgia Tech, all in electrical engineering. His name is John Hansen, and he studied digital signal processing and speech processing and communications and biomedical engineering, and he wrote a dissertation entitled [clears throat] \"Analysis and Compensation of Stressed and Noisy Speech with Application to Robust Automatic Recognition.\" All of this is to say that back in the 1980's, when none of us carried portable phones that understood what we said to them and followed our instructions, John Hansen was helping develop machines that could understand human speech. It was a focus of his academic research, which continued at Duke, and Colorado, and, since 2005, at the University of Texas at Dallas, where he's now the Associate Dean for Research at UTD's Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science. He's also the university Distinguished Chair in Telecommunications Engineering and the director and founder of the Center for Robust Speech Systems, among other things. When it comes to speech recognition technology, he knows his stuff.  The other track stretches back, as they sometimes say, from time immemorial [echo]. Even in caveman times, the human residence of Planet Earth had had a curiosity about the lights in the nighttime sky. Maybe the other animals had it too. But anyway, humans have paid attention to the things in the skies, and made use of them, and wondered about them. The Ask an Astronomer website at Cornell University cites early civilizations that use the bodies that moved across their skies to keep track of time, to orient their cities. They named the stars and plotted their positions. By the Middle Ages, they'd proven that the Sun is the center of our solar system and described the orbits of the planets. And they used telescopes to get a close look at the planets and the Moon, Earth's largest natural satellite. The fact that the Moon has been on our minds is reflected in art through the ages. Just go online and search \"Moon in art.\" You'll see what I mean. It's also in music -- \"Fly Me to the Moon,\" \"Bad Moon Rising,\" \"Moondance,\" \"Moon River,\" \"Blue Moon,\" \"Pink Moon,\" \"Dark Side of the Moon.\" It was also the subject of A Trip to the Moon. It's one of the earliest science fiction films. You know the one -- the, with the image of the bullet-shape rocket ship stuck in the Man in the Moon's eye. In the latter half of the 20th century, the idea of sending people to the Moon became a goal during the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. That started over the nuclear arms race and the development of ballistic missile technology in the service of national defense. And that led to launching artificial satellites to Earth orbit, and then to launching probes out of Earth orbit, and then, well, then it was let's launch people to the Moon. And here we are back in Texas in Houston at Rice University with President John Kennedy. He had proposed to Congress in mid 1961 that the United States should establish the Moon landing as a goal. And that led to NASA's creation of Project Apollo and, with it, the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston. When the president came to Houston to visit the construction site in September of 1962, he gave a speech at Rice University that was designed to drum up popular support for the American space program. Here's an extended cut.  President John Kennedy: Surely, the opening vistas of space promise high costs and hardships as well as high reward. So it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest, to wait. But this city of Houston, this state of Texas, this country of the United States was not built by those who waited, and rested, and wished to look behind them.  [ Applause ]  This country was conquered by those who moved forward, and so will space. William Bradford, speaking in 1630 of the founding of the Plymouth Bay Colony, said that all great and honorable actions are accompanied with great difficulties, and both must be enterprised and overcome with answerable courage. If this capsule history of our progress teaches us anything, it is that man, in his quest for knowledge and progress, is determined and cannot be deterred. The exploration of space will go ahead, whether we join in it or not, and it is one of the great adventures of all time. And no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space. Those who came before us made certain that this country rode the first waves of the Industrial Revolution, the first waves of modern invention, and the first wave of nuclear power. And this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of space. We mean to be a part of it. We mean to lead it.  [ Applause ]  For the eyes of the world now look into space, to the Moon and to the planets beyond. And we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace. We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding. Yet, the vows of this nation can only be fulfilled if we in this nation are first. And therefore, we intend to be first.  [ Applause ]  In short, our leadership in science and industry, our hopes for peace and security, our obligations to ourselves as well as others all require us to make this effort, to solve these mysteries, to solve them for the good of all men, and to become the world's leading space-faring nation. We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained and new rights to be won. And they must be won and used for the progress of all peace. For space science, like nuclear science and all technology, has no conscience of its own. Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man, and only if the United States occupies a position of preeminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new, terrifying theater of war. I do not say that we should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea, but I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war, without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours. There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind. And its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. But why, some say, the Moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas? We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills. Because that challenge is one that we're willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win.   [ Applause ]  Host: The president's stated goal in September 1962 was to put a man on the Moon by the end of the decade, which was just 7 years down the road at the time. NASA and its commercial partners got busy, designing and building spacecraft, testing and flying, and testing and flying some more, drawing up detailed plans for space missions and Moon missions, and developing the architecture and the hardware for the systems on the ground that would support the flights to Earth orbit and then to the Moon.  [ Music ]  Christopher Kraft was one of the first few dozen engineers hired to get the Space Task Group going when NASA was created in 1958. He was assigned to work in flight operations for Project Mercury at a time when no one had flown in space yet. Kraft and his colleagues had to figure out how to coordinate the ground support, the spacecraft tracking, the communications networks, the flight plans and procedures, the timelines, everything. And Kraft decided that the astronaut in a spacecraft shouldn't be responsible for coordinating all the parts of the spaceflight during the spaceflight. He's credited with coming up with the concept of the mission control center, the location where engineers with expertise in all the systems that would be needed during a flight could keep an eye on the latest telemetry data for their area of responsibility. And all of them would work in concert to move the mission toward its goal, and they would do that under the leadership of the flight director. Chris Kraft served as NASA's first flight director, call sign RED WHITE, and he was key to inventing the mission planning and control processes that NASA's been using ever since. Today, the building that houses these flight control rooms in Houston is named the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center. The dozen or more operators who are on duty during any shift in the control room are plugged in to a voice communication system that has many individually selectable voice channels, which are referred to as loops. This system allows the flight director and each member of the team to talk to one another right there in the room without having to get up from their desk or shout across the room. It also allows each member of the team to communicate with their own support staff, who are located off the main floor in what are referred to as the back rooms. They can also listen to the conversation when the astronauts in space talk to the capsule communicator, called the Capcom, who sits right next to the flight director and is the sole conduit to relaying information back and forth. That conversation happens on a loop called Air to Ground or Space to Ground. Well, let me give you an example: a little slice of life from mission control, Houston, during the Apollo 11 mission.  Voice 1: Hey Telcom?  Voice 2: Telcom Inco.  Voice 1: If you look on page 3-55 A of your flight plan, you'll see that that at 85 hours—  [ Overlapping Voices 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. ]  Host: Well, you can hear there are a lot of voice loops on the system, and any or all of them could have voice traffic going at any time. What you can probably also figure out, when you think about it, is that an organization like NASA that is famous for its attention to detail, and for striving to have backups to every plan and backups to the backups, just in case, and which tries not to leave any stone unturned over, NASA made the decision way back in the day that the traffic on all these voice loops needed to be recorded. So they needed people to tend to the recorders and the playback machines.  Larry Vrooman: My name is Larry Vrooman. I started working with Fort Aerospace the first week of January 1979. And the recorder, they actually made me, as a technician, responsible for its service and maintenance, that the single playback machine and both recorders were my responsibility until they were retired in 1982.  Host: Now, the machines you're referring there, to there, the recorders and playback machines, help me understand what they were, what they were designed to do, and, if you know, why they decided they needed those things.  Larry Vrooman: I think they may be unique in that they were contracted, and designed, and manufactured specifically for Fort Aerospace -- i.e. NASA. But they were 30-track machines. And at the time, that was a large or intense compaction of channels and probably was the max available at the time in 1961. They were logging recorders, audio logging recorders. They were also, similar models were also used by police departments to record phone lines and their various phone calls. That's what I, that was my understanding is that they were normally used for phone call recording.  Host: And in the case of NASA, they were recording the voice activity in the Mission Control Center?  Larry Vrooman: Not just the Mission Control Center.  Host: Oh, where else?  Larry Vrooman: A lot of the audio channels, we called them loops. The way they set up the audio system in the building, we called them loops, and each loop could be internal, or external, or domestic, or international based upon its function. And as an example, we had a lot of issues with feedback sometimes or oscillations and funny noises in the system, and it was a constant battle to keep that in control because the, some of those channels went, some of those loops went worldwide.  Host: And the loops we're talking about, these are voice communication channels--  Larry Vrooman: It's a lot like a telephone line, but it's local, and domestic, and international. We had 1 playback machine, which is the one you've seen. And then, there was, in effect, 4 recorders. There were 2 racks. Each rack had 2 tape decks in them so they could hand over to each other and, therefore, run 24 hours a day. There were 2 racks. Each machine would, basically, was a backup for the other. If there was a major failure in 1 machine, you just switched to the other machine. It had 2 decks you could continue to run and meet all your requirements. The -- and in fact, we had 1 failure that caused us a few days or weeks of downtime on 1 machine. And it's a good thing that the other machine ran fine during that time. The tapes that I myself handled in recording, we would put them in a rack at the completion of every day, and mark them, and keep them for a year or 2 or so. As long as we were still getting requests from the various flight controllers or whoever needed it, we would need to keep the tapes there, and we would play back and make secondary recordings for them, little snippets here and there. They were used for various purposes.  Host: Like, purposes like what?  Larry Vrooman: Well, an astronaut might want to review an experiment that he did, and he might have some audio that he did down to the ground with scientists or whoever. And he might want to review that to create a transcript or something like that. It just, multiple things. I've had lots of -- I'll give you a story.  Host: Yeah.  Larry Vrooman: I had a Secret Service agent come in one day wanting some audio. I don't even remember what he wanted. But at the end of making the tape, he's standing there, and he goes, \"How do I pay for this?\" And I said, \"Well, you pay taxes?\" He said, \"Yeah.\" And I said, \"It's paid for.\" [laughter]  Host: Good, so--  Larry Vrooman: We had requests from, you know, everywhere for various purposes, and NASA's an open agency. Anybody asks, we try to provide.  Host: So there were tapes of the conversations of the team of flight controllers who oversaw the successful first landing of man on the Moon. Those might really be interesting for historians or for people who do research in speech processing and language technology.  John Hansen: I do research primarily in speech processing and language technology.  Host: People like John Hansen.  [ Music ]  John Hansen: My name is John Hansen, and my title -- I serve as Associate Dean for Research as well as a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Texas at Dallas.  Host: And a lot of your work, I take it, is in research. What are your research areas of interest?  John Hansen: So I do research primarily in speech processing and language technology. So that involves looking at audio analysis, extracting information out of those audio streams. That would include speaker recognition, speech recognition, language identification. We also work on applications that might help people that have hearing loss. And perhaps extracting knowledge from audio that might help in the educational space.  Host: That's hard for me to even follow, the, just the range of things you're talking about there. Are you creating a new area of [laughs] academic research?  John Hansen: No. No, I, the reason why it sounds like it's such broad or wide is because the field has evolved over many years. So I've been a professor for 28 years, and if you were to go back, you know, into the 1980's, 1990's, the main emphasis or focus there, like for speech recognition, was actually small vocabulary -- small, handheld devices or voice control. Maybe 10, 20 words or 100 words at most. People were always dreaming and trying to do larger vocabulary speech recognition, but the computing infrastructure was not available at the time. And also, the algorithms were not very mature. And so as time goes on, problems evolve and become different. And I would say, certainly, over the last 10 to 20 years, computing infrastructure has greatly changed the field of speech processing and language technology. And so now, there are new, emerging problems that people weren't trying to solve 20 years ago, but are actually introducing and helping society in a really nice way.  Host: As I've been looking at the story of these tapes, I ran into some stuff that said you got started -- the beginning of the story has to do with you trying to find recordings of conversations that involved many, many people. I've also seen where it looked like this evolved out of you trying to find examples of groups solving problems. Is either of those really where this story starts?  John Hansen: Yeah. Actually -- it's actually correct, yeah. What, one of the things we looked for is when you look at speech technology, as an engineer, you, you're wanting to solve maybe some signal processing work, maybe developing language models or understanding how people pronounce words and so forth. But that's actually kind of like laying bricks, you know. If you're building a wall or building a house, you can lay that foundation. But what you do after you have that, you know, there's other people, other things that you might want to do. And so people, for example, in a society, maybe in education, maybe in psychology, are interested in seeing, well, if you could identify or recognize the text of what someone says, how do you interpret how they interact with other people? What do they actually mean when they said these things? And so probably the examples one could look at in, you know, over the last maybe 15 or 20 years might be looking at natural disasters or areas where major security issues. If you look, for example, at 9/11, okay, you might say, all right, well, when an event like this happens maybe in New York City or Washington, D.C. and so forth, how do people actually work collaboratively together? They probably weren't working together before an event happened. And the instant it does happen, how do people actually connect and understand the chain of command? Who's responsible for making which decisions? You can also look for natural disasters -- Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, for example, here in the Gulf Coast areas. How do people actually, you know, work collaboratively in these modes?  Host: How does a random group of individuals suddenly turn into a group?  John Hansen: Yeah, that's true. And so, you know, the field of speech and language technology, most, you know, if you look at all the work that's been done in the field of speech technology, the vast majority, over the last 50 years, is focused on the telephone. But the telephone has always been point to point -- one person talking to another person over a handset. And today, when we look at smartphone technologies, it's much more likely that you would have group discussions. You're going to have more than 1, more than 2 people kind of working or interacting together. And so the problem in the field of speech and language technology is that there really are no corpora available that look at group dynamics and group interaction. And so when we approached the National Science Foundation, we said we really wanted to kind of come up with research that would advance multi-speaker analyses to try and understand how people work collaboratively together.  Host: And the National Science Foundation was interested. Tatiana Korelsky is the program director of the division that focuses on things like human speech technologies, speech analysis, and speech synthesis. And she reviewed Hansen's proposal and request for funding.  Tatiana Korelsky: So the proposal that he submitted was, in a sense, very unique because it was meant to use the integration of existing and slightly beyond the state-of-the-art speech technologies, such as diarization and automatic speech recognition, to process very particular, unique data and data which was not trivial. It was very noisy, very multichannel, very multi-speaker. So it was a very, very difficult type of data to process by speech technology. So in that respect and also, an additional, of course, that wasn't just any corpus. It was the corpus of Apollo tapes, which, in what we call broader impact, was very important because it was very important corpus, which is like our legacy of space program and, in general, a great American achievement. That's why it was, like, on many, in many aspects, this proposal was unique and very interesting.  Host: That's right. Hansen proposed doing this research using the audio recorded in mission control, Houston, during the first landing of men on the Moon in July 1969. But why use Apollo 11?  John Hansen: But we couldn't go to 9/11, let's say, New York City. You couldn't go to, like, you know, Hurricane Katrina events and things like this because many of the audio that we could get access to could potentially not be released. In addition to that, none of them were synchronized, so it's very hard to understand who was doing what and at what time if you don't have a common time frame. And so those challenges actually NASA solved for us because when we went back, we started doing some homework in looking at Apollo. And we saw, well, lo and behold, NASA recorded all this with timecode. That was the big plus.  Host: How did you become aware that that had even happened? If you had gone to the National Science Foundation and were looking for help but didn't know where there was, you know, what turns out to be a recording of many people talking all over each other all at the same time, how did you know that that was even there?  John Hansen: We knew that NASA recorded the audio. A lot of the Air to Ground, called Capcom, that's been released. And so at least that communication we knew was there. However, most of the audio that involved Mission Control, a lot of the back room discussions, support staff that were providing support to Mission Control, most of that audio had never really been released. And we thought, well, this actually would be an interesting space to look at. You know, the average, you know, K-12 type student pretty much knows hopefully most of the astronauts, at least the 12 Moon walkers. But most do not know who was working behind the scenes.  Host: Did you know that those conversations had been recorded?  John Hansen: Well, one of the things that, growing up -- and I was a little kid when we walked on the Moon--  Host: So was I.  John Hansen: Yeah, yeah. And for me, the thing I always remembered in looking at every picture or any video played from Mission Control, there was always, you know, a NASA scientist, engineer, specialist -- white shirt, little black tie, and a headset. The headset was always on. I could always see that. And so being a speech and audio type person, my feeling was if anyone has an audio set, that means that audio's got to be recorded somewhere. At least, I would always hope that. And we were pretty fortunate that NASA still had all of these recordings and all of the tapes.  Host: Tell, okay, so you, it was your hunch that NASA had recordings of all these conversations?  John Hansen: Yeah, but we were a little naive, and one of the reasons is because when we wrote the proposal to the National Science Foundation, we had just assumed that NASA had all this in digital format and it was already available. And so we put the proposal in, and NSF and the reviewers really thought this would be an enormously valuable effort to support, one because it would advance the speech and language technology, but even more importantly, it would certainly preserve the audio that would've come from this, probably the most significant engineering accomplishment mankind has had over the last 100 years. But it would also give people outside of the technology side the ability to start looking at human aspects. How do actually people work collaboratively together? When do they become unhappy about things? And this actually might help motivate kids to go into STEM, we hope. It also might allow us to have a better understanding if we're sending folks to the, to Mars, how they might actually collaborate in a stronger way.  Host: Tatiana Korelsky wanted to make sure I knew what the review panel thought of Hansen's proposal, so she read me a part of the evaluation.  Tatiana Korelsky: So this is what they said. \"The most creative and original concepts related to the combination of technologies and enhancements which will come together by way of the focused research on spoken audio in the NASA archives. This is a task just beyond the reach of current technology due to the combination of channel conditions, background noise, and the type of speech. Spontaneous conversational speech, over often under stress conditions. So that challenges our characteristic of real-world data, which makes the need to address them pressing if the full potential of information locked within spoken content is to be realized.\" After such evaluation, of course, the program decision was to award this project, which started in -- the proposal was 2012, so we started at the end of fiscal year 2012 and lasted until 2016, with some extension.  Host: So as I understand it, the basic area of research that he was proposing was something that you found to be of interest. And the choice to have the subject be about the Apollo missions, that historic event, was something that made it even sweeter, even nicer.  Tatiana Korelsky: Of course. Of course. That's why I say it was a unique proposal.  Host: So you went to the National Science Foundation with a proposal to do this project, assuming that NASA had recorded all those conversations back in 1969?  John Hansen: Recorded them and hopefully, we thought, digitized them.  Host: Well, I was going to make that a separate part of it. So then, you, I assume, the next step is to go to NASA and say, please?  John Hansen: Well, we needed the money first, so, yeah. So we were pretty fortunate NSF said this was a good thing to do. But we still had some concerns. And so we had to resubmit it a second time. It took more than a year. And it was interesting because I was at a conference involving Department of Defense, and there was a gentleman that walked up to me and said, \"Well, I hear you have interest in Apollo and NASA.\" And I was kind of surprised because I didn't think someone would know about that, and I started, you know, running off I was, you know, a geeky engineer and said, \"Yeah, we're really excited about this. We hope NSF will fund this the next time.\" And the gentleman said that, \"Well, yeah. I was kind of involved in the review process, and I can't officially say anything, but it's a really good project. You probably need to have someone that is more involved on the history side also involved.\" And that was actually a thing that we added when we resubmitted, and it made a difference because it allowed us now not just to focus on the technology, but be able to kind of connect it to society. We really wanted to have something that would allow K-12 type kids to kind of see and listen to the audio.  Host: So it was no longer just the academic investigation of the interaction of the individuals in this group, but that the individuals in this group were the people who landed on the Moon.  John Hansen: That's right. That's right. That's right.  Host: Which people we'd hopefully be a little more interested in.  John Hansen: Yeah, so, I mean, I, a lot of the technology and things that we've done with this work over the last 5, 6 years now, we've gone, in Dallas, we've gone to the Perot Museum pretty much every year for Engineers Week. And we've usually brought a, always brought an undergraduate senior design team to the Perot Museum. And it's nice to sit back and allow undergraduates to kind of show how excited they are in terms of talking about audio and these types of activities. And at least during the Perot Museum, they typically have about 1500 to 2500 kids per day during Engineers Week that actually come in. And they're little kids. I mean, they're through K-12 -- maybe not through 12. Maybe K-8 is where they're coming. And that, to me, was really a very enjoyable thing because you always think, well, we'll develop technologies. It'll be in the college level. How does that actually help kids that are in grade school, and what might motivate them to kind of go and look not necessarily at being an astronaut, but developing math, physics, chemistry, biology, or something that might actually help support space exploration?  Host: Hansen succeeded at the National Science Foundation, which awarded the first grant in September of 2012 just shy of $400,000 to fund the project. That meant Hansen was ready to approach NASA with his idea and that he was about to get a big surprise.  John Hansen: Right after we got the grant, we came down to NASA. And I naively said, \"Well, can you show us where you have the audio?\" And Greg Wiseman pointed us to some boxes of tapes, and I'd said, \"We're in trouble here because we thought this was all digitized.\"  Host: And that's not all. Hansen was about to find out that not only was the audio still on big reel-to-reel tapes, but there was no machine that could play those tapes so he could digitize the audio so he could do his research. In the next episode, we'll start the long, strange trip to a solution to those problems.  [ Music ]  Yep, the story turned out to be too big to cram it all into one episode and do it justice, so we're breaking it into a few pieces. I hope you're hooked and will come back for the rest.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 139, “Apollo 13.” I'm Gary Jordan; I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. On April 13, 1970, roughly 200,000 miles away from Earth, John or \"Jack\" Swigert, Fred Haise, and James or \"Jim\" Lovell, the crew members of Apollo 13 had just wrapped up a TV broadcast before turning it in for the night. Nine minutes later, after Swigert flipped one switch for a routine churn of the liquid oxygen tanks, oxygen tank number two exploded, which led to a chain reaction that left the crew in a dire situation. \"Houston, we've had a problem,\" rings over the audio loops.  Capcom: Say again, please?  Apollo 13 (Lovell): Houston, we've had a problem.  Host: To set the stage, here's what Houston and the crew were up against. On the Apollo spacecraft, there were three main areas that ended up playing much different roles after the blast. The service module, the command module, and the lunar module. The service module was stocked with the oxygen, water, and power needed for the mission. However, it also housed the main propulsion and maneuvering systems for the spacecraft. When the oxygen tank exploded, the crew lost these consumables, and the service module was rendered non-functional. The command module was the control center, and served as the crew compartment, accommodating all three astronauts. This module was also designed for re-entry and was equipped with enough power and consumables only for the crew's descent back into Earth's atmosphere. However, the command module had to be powered down to avoid depleting its systems. If it hadn't been, then it would have been impossible for the crew to perform the re-entry operations to return to Earth. The lunar module was designed to make a landing on the Moon, while providing a home base on the lunar surface, and was designed for only two astronauts. However, it ultimately ended up being a lifeboat for all three of them on this mission. It allowed the crew to save the command module supplies for re-entry because it had its own systems for power and consumables. Also, with the service module inoperable, the descent engine on the lunar module was the only way to provide propulsion to perform the maneuvers needed to set up the spacecraft's trajectory enough so the crew could get home. On top of that, it was extremely cold, drinking water and food were scarce, the condensation began to build up inside the spacecraft. Yet against all these odds, over the course of the next four days, the crew members and the ground support team tirelessly worked together, and Swigert, Haise, and Lovell were safely brought back home on April 17th, 1970. And it was because of the experience gained in rescuing the crew that the Apollo 13 mission was considered a successful failure. It's after this famous phrase, \"Houston, we've had a problem,\" where in the face of adversity, it was the perseverance, intelligence, and guardianship of the flight controllers and engineers here in Houston, and the bravery of the Apollo 13 crew, that made for a legendary trip back to Earth. It's after this incredible journey for which this podcast, “Houston We Have a Podcast,” is named. So today, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 13 mission and the human ingenuity and spirit that brought the crew home safe, we sit down with Fred Haise and Jim Lovell. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Fred and Jim, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have A Podcast today.  Fred Haise: Glad to be here, glad to be here. Glad to join you.  Host: [laughs] So this April marks the 50th anniversary of Apollo 13, that's the mission we're going to be talking about today. That's an incredible amount of time. Does it feel like 50 years have gone by? Fred, we'll start with you.  Fred Haise: Well at times it does, but now I'm getting at an age right now I realize a lot of time has gone by. But of course, over the years, Jim and I have got to talk about it a lot. Many, many events over the years.  Host: That's right. Yeah. And I'm sure that more coming up now with the 50th anniversary. Jim, what about you? Does it feel like 50 years?  Jim Lovell: It does. It's a long time now since that flight occurred. But I keep thinking about it, and of course, this year, I've been getting a lot of telephone calls regarding it.  Host: I'm sure! Have you seen each other, you and Fred, recently? Just through all of the-- I guess all of these requests that have been coming down, I'm sure you're very busy around this time.  Jim Lovell: Yes. I don't think we have. When was the last time we saw each other, Fred?  Fred Haise: It was at some event. I mean, yes that's when we normally get together, with ourselves and other comrades as well, for several Apollo-- like Apollo 11 events that were recently held, for Apollo 11.  Host: OK. Yes. So, events-- yes around some of these anniversaries.  Fred Haise: Exactly.  Host: Gentlemen, you're both aviators, military men. You-- after NASA, you became corporate executives. Taking a snapshot right now, 50 years after Apollo 13, tell me about some of your proudest moments in your career, and just highlights now that we're 50 years past this mark. Jim, we'll start with you.  Jim Lovell: Well, of course the proudest moments for me was my tenure in the NASA program, and flying, what, four flights, especially Apollo 8, and then of course the-- probability of not coming back on 13 and working carefully with Mission Control to make this a successful failure.  Host: Fred, what about you?  Fred Haise: Well, I think Jim and I were both naval aviators. Now he was a Navy guy, and I was a Marine guy. But other than that, we both wore the wings of gold. No, my NASA career included a couple of backups before 13. I backed up Bill Anders on Apollo 8, which Jim flew. And I backed up Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11, with Jim. We were the backup crew on that one and flew 13. And then I backed up John Young on 16. With Grumman-- with Grumman I started and ended up at Northrop Grumman for 17 years. I guess the two things I'm proud of is two contracts I had, major contracts, were shuttle processing contracts. So, I was involved in turning around space shuttles to go fly again for 12 years.  Host: How about that?  Fred Haise: And the second one was the system engineering integration contract I ran on early Space Station, Freedom. So, it's the beginnings of the [International Space Station] ISS. It was a different shape and form when we were doing it, but that's what ended up being ISS.  Host: [laughs] Well, let's zoom back 50 years to this mission, Apollo 13. I want to start with the launch. Jim, you were no stranger to the Saturn 5, this gigantic rocket launching on Apollo 8 first. Can you tell me about your experience that second time launching for Apollo 13?  Jim Lovell: Well, Saturn 5 was like old hams to me, because of Apollo 8. But it was an old man's rocket compared to the Titan that we flew on Gemini. It was not hard at all. It was a slow buildup on G loading, and then finally it went to various stages working. And I rather enjoyed it.  Host: Oh really? Fred, now what about you?  Fred Haise: Well, the most unusual thing to me of the G's or motion was, it was kind of herky-jerky when the engines gimbaled. And the kind of motion, particularly sideways motion you felt was unusual from airplane-- and you don't see it in turbulence or anything. Otherwise, like Jim said, the G's were fairly modest. I think the peak was four and a half. And we had both flown fighters, even in our older fighters, you could pull 6, 7 G's, in combat maneuvering. So, you know that wasn't that big a deal compared to our airplane experience.  Host: Yes. I can see why Jim called it an old man's rocket. Yes, it was just-- it was different. It wasn't as intense as maybe people think, looking at this gigantic rocket, that makes so much noise. Now after launch, it seems like things are going pretty normal, of course, until it's time to stir the tank. And then you hear this-- hear and feel, this explosion. Fred, can you tell me about your first thoughts when this event occurred?  Fred Haise: Well, I mean we heard the bang, and you know, it rang through this metallic structure. We're in metal vehicles. And of course, the first thing is, what was it? What was it? And at the time, I got to the-- left the lunar module where I was putting away equipment we had out to do a show and tell TV show. I was still putting things away, by the time I drifted up to my position in the right couch, which had a lot of the cryogenics and the fuel cells, and all of that, I looked and saw one oxygen, two oxygen instruments on Tank 2 in the bottoms, both pressure and quantity. And I knew we had lost one oxygen tank, almost for sure, because it's two different kind of sensors that would feed those dials. And so, I knew we had lost a tank, and I knew we had-- that would constitute an abort. So, I was sick to my stomach with disappointment, because I knew pretty quick we had an aborted mission, and we weren't going to get to land on the Moon.  Host: Jim, did you have the same feeling, the same thought process that led you to “Oh no, we're going to have to abort and not land on the Moon?”  Jim Lovell: It's about the same as Fred. I was just going down into the command module when the explosion occurred. I looked up at Fred to see if he knew what caused the noise, and I could tell from his expression that he didn't know at the time, and then I looked down at Jack, and I noticed that he-- his face was such that he was wondering what was going on. And then of course, when I got down into the command module, I saw the warning light was on, and we had lost a fuel cell to begin with. But the conclusion was that I drifted over to the window and looked out the window. I can't tell you now why I did it, but when I did, I saw escaping at a high rate of speed a gaseous substance from the back of our spacecraft, and it dawned on me that yes, we had lost something. And then I looked at the oxygen gauges, and one read zero, and the other one was going down, so that-- you know, it said that everything for us, that this was a real problem.  Host: Were you thinking maybe there's a way to fix this, and we can land on the Moon? Or did you truly think, yeah, I think we're going to have to abort this?  Jim Lovell: Well, I knew that this was not going to be landing at this time. And I think even when I saw the gas leaving, I knew that this was going to be a trial, to try to get back to Earth.  Host: Yeah. Now you know, you went through a lot of training on the ground, first, to get to this moment, and Jim, you even had an experience flying to the Moon, so there was a lot of experience just in that mission. But how did the training and what you thought could happen, and training for different scenarios, how did that compare to this actual scenario?  Jim Lovell: Well, as far as I'm concerned, this was all-- something entirely new. Done a lot of training, and we had thought about using the lunar module in previous works that we had done, but the situation that put us in was one which was, you know, new to us at the time. And it was new to everybody as a matter of fact. And therefore, we had to figure out what exactly went wrong, what do we have to work with, and fortunately we had communications with mission control, and that's how the things got started.  Host: Fred, now what was some of the more important, or more useful parts of your training that prepared you to deal with this problem?  Fred Haise: Oh, I don't think you can say it's a useful part. All the training was done in what we call simulations, where we were tied to mission control from simulators at Kennedy. And there was actually a group that worked behind the scenes, [Simulation Supervisor] SimSup, that worked very diligently to try to prepare a set of failures that only they knew to trick us, to make us and mission control look bad. So, we went through-- I'd been through-- Jim too, through several missions before.  Host: Yes.  Fred Haise: With several thousands of hours of this kind of training. So-- but this, as Jim said, this was a unique problem. It had not been considered-- it had been considered, but if you had an explosion, if you looked at the mean effects analysis on explosions, they're mainly considered for rocket engines. But nevertheless, the answer was you lose the vehicle and the crew. And so obviously for this condition, there was no Plan B ready. And I think Jack Lousma, capped it-- well at one point when things settled a little bit-- Jack Lousma was Capcom and he said, “man this is a heck of a sim.”  Host: [laughs] Well, so you mention in the sim, you know, you mentioned they're trying to trick us. They want-- I think they want you to think through some problems. But in the event of a real-life contingency, tell me about the working with the flight controllers to solve the problem together. You know, thinking about what can I solve, and then what can we rely on our smart group of flight controllers and engineers on the ground to help solve, and balancing that?   Jim Lovell: Well of course it was one of cooperation between both mission control and ourselves, but you have to kind of look at the synopsis of this particular flight. If you were superstitious, this was the perfect flight to look at, 13 being the name of the spacecraft. You know, we'd had before the flight, we had the threat of measles. We lost the engine on the second stage of-- during the boost phase, and now the explosion occurred. But the explosion occurred at just the right time to make sure that we could-- or to get our return safely. If the explosion occurred, and we'd already gotten to the high velocity to go to the Moon, we'd probably have had to go around the Moon to come back home again, and I don't think the lunar module would have had the electrical capacity to get us home. If the explosion occurred once we were in lunar orbit, or you know, around the lunar surface, well then, we would have been stranded at the Moon.  Host: Yes. Fred, did you have sort of the same thoughts, that this happened at just the right time, or maybe you had some doubts that maybe, oh you know, maybe something else could go wrong?  Fred Haise: No, I didn't think about the right time or wrong time. To me it was the wrong time to have a problem, but-- no that came to me some time later.  Host: Yes.  Fred Haise: Yes.  Host: Now I know, on the ground, there was this-- you know, to think about questions to ask you, I did go back, and I watched the movie, “Apollo 13,” fantastic. And I know there was this thought of should we do a direct abort? Should we go right back home? Or should we circle around the Moon, and then there were just a lot of unknowns. And it was all happening on the ground. You were up in Odyssey, and then in Aquarius, just sort of waiting for the direction. Did you have a sense of some of these decisions that were happening on the ground, and considerations? Jim, I'll start with you.  Jim Lovell: Well, yes, we'd thought of various things what to do with what we had onboard and can do to get home. The first thing that the ground said, and I think they were right, we got to get back on the free-returning course. We had changed our course, because they had thought that it-- when we got to the Moon and we started descent, we would probably have the sun overhead, and the Moon surface would be wiped out. And so, we changed our course to another course that we had to get back on that course. So that was the first thing that we had to do, once we powered up the lunar module.  Host: Yeah. Now after this event, you know, you're working through the problems, and you're going back around the Moon, because the goal now, the new mission is, we have to return home safely. So, you know, you throw out the old flight plan. Now you're sort of dealing with this. Was there a lot of waiting, a lot of boredom in-between some of these key phases at this point? And if so, what were you guys talking about? Fred, we'll start with you.  Fred Haise: Well yes. We had times, like Jim mentioned, we did that maneuver, and we had coasting time to get around to the back side of the Moon, where shortly two hours after that low point around the back side, we did another maneuver. So, there was some-- we don't want to call it relaxed time. It wasn't very relaxed.  Host: Yeah.  Fred Haise: But we-- I don't recall we talked a lot at the time. As we got to view the Moon, Jack and I had some cameras ready to sightsee and shoot a bunch of pictures. We had several Hasselblad’s rigged to shoot some pictures as we went around the Moon. Turned out we were at a higher point than previous flights. We were 130 miles above the surface, which gave us a larger span of the Moon to shoot. Farouk El-Baz, one of our trainers for lunar geology, in the lunar scene told us afterwards that we shot some very good pictures that had not been shot before. I think he was trying to make us feel good, that we had done something right on this mission. Something that-- to contribute something. So, anyway, I don't recall talking very much about the situation.  Host: Now Jim, do you have a moment during the mission where you could actually take a step back and just realize where you were and appreciate-- some moment of awe during your journey around the Moon?  Jim Lovell: Well, yes. I of course, there was no choice but to have to go around the Moon to get back home again. We were glad that the, getting back on the free-returning course was done, because one of our problems in the lunar module was the fact that we had the command service module attached to us. So, the center of gravity of the lunar module was way out in left field, which meant that you know, trying to control the lunar module was a little bit different. It was like driving a car, and you wanted to go right, you had to turn the wheel left. But we finally got through that OK.  Host: Yes. Fred, do you remember seeing the Earth from the Moon at any point, and what were those feelings?  Fred Haise: Well, overall, I guess one of the two surprising or maybe unusual or, as you say awe things about flying in space, it was my first time. One was zero-g, obviously to experience that on a continuum. But it was the scenes out the window, not just around the Moon, but even the Earth, and as it faded away as we left, swiftly. But then looking at the Moon as we went by, and of course seeing the small Earth, which is a very beautiful body in contrast to the Moon. So that-- out the window views were just unbelievable at times. I'd look and see, am I really here looking at what I'm looking at? So that kind of thing.  Host: Yes. Now Fred, you mentioned there was a lot of points where you weren't talking. I'm sure there were moments where you were thinking about other things. Maybe thinking about your family. Jim, do you remember at some points just sort of wondering about your family, how they were doing? Knowing that they were watching you and hoping for a safe return.  Jim Lovell: Oh yes, of course I thought about my family all the time. And I also-- you know, thought about just where I am and what I'm doing. But it was one of these things that I think, and people who are trained to be test pilots, and looking at problems as they occurred, that you have to have a positive attitude. You have to look at what you've got, and how can you get home. And as long as we could get over one crisis after another, we kept, you know, thinking positive, and until we finally made the landing.  Host: And you had that mindset too, Fred, about just trying to remain positive and stay the course, and think about those next things, those next steps?  Fred Haise: Yes, until it's over, it's not over.  Host: Yeah.  Fred Haise: I had one point where I was alone in the lunar module, and went into some compartment, I think I was looking for something to eat, and found pictures of my family that had been placed there. I didn't, somebody else did. And it made me think. But I was not worried so much about the family because I knew they had lots of support. At every mission, you had other astronauts, other wives. I knew they would be at the home to support the wife. And of course, NASA had a protocol officer that was normally posted there, that would take care of anything the wife wanted taken care of, effectively. Answer the phone, or go get groceries, or whatever. So, I knew the family at least was being supported by others back home.  Host: Did you get a chance to talk to them? When was the next time you actually got to talk to your family after the mission?  Fred Haise: No unlike later-- I guess Skylab even-- no we had no-- we only had the regular air-to-ground to-- so we never talked to the families until we got back.  Host: Yes. Can you tell me what some of the-- you know, coming back from the mission, talking to the family and thinking about-- thinking about your place, after returning, you know, this mission we thought it was going to go one way, but it didn't. But you returned safely. Can you talk about just the conversations you had with the family and just with some of the flight control teams, now that you are home safe? What was going on there? Jim, we'll start with you.  Jim Lovell: Well, naturally when we finally got home there was a big sigh of relief. And we met the family in Hawaii I believe, and everybody was happy about that. But then you know, you kind of look back and say you know, my last mission, that's what I thought it was going to be, was to land on the Moon, and now-- that was no longer it. So, there was a little bit of disappointment to it, even though my wife didn't think there was any disappointment. She got me home, and that was the main thing. But then I realized, I realized over the years, after I look back on this flight, that it was a failure, but it was also a success in the fact that at-- by the time Apollo 13 flew, this was the 5th flight to the Moon. People were getting sort of bored by this time. And it suddenly brought back to the populous of the importance of the space program, and what we're actually doing, and the success we had in the past. And it brought people back to looking at NASA in a more positive mode and following the flights that followed 13.  Host: Fred, did you see sort of that same, similar idea, that there was more attention toward some of the later Apollo missions?  Fred Haise: Well, one of the surprises to me was, when we got back, was to see some of the media, newspapers, because we really didn't know how this was being taken. Never on the radio was ever discussed how this mission with the problems was being received, was it-- or in fact, sort of back of my mind was would this call for the cancelation of the program? Which I certainly didn't want on my tombstone. But anyway, it was amazing. I mean, it was worldwide attention, worldwide prayers, wishing us well to get back. So, I was just amazed how that was taken. It was not, as Jim said, a successful failure. It was not taken that way at all. It was taken as a great achievement in that we got back safely.  Host: Yes. Now there was a lot you had to endure in that, and a lot of work that went into making that-- either you know, calling it a successful failure, or just a mission to celebrate, there was a lot learned from a personal aspect, from a human aspect. Jim, do you recall anything that you learned personally, just as a human being, and what human beings are capable of to deal with problems like this, and to learn from them, and adapt moving on?  Jim Lovell: Well, of course I think of the period that we were there, I really learned that you can't suddenly have a problem, and then just you know, close your eyes and hope there's a miracle coming on, because the miracle is something you have to do yourself, or having people to help you. Any kind of a problem that we have. And so, to me, this was a milestone of my life, and we got over it, and of course, I've had crisis before, and I've had crisis after that. I take everyone very carefully and thoughtfully.  Host: You know, one thing I admire just about the mission itself is just I know-- I know there was a lot of elements against you. You know, you had of course, the stirring the oxygen tanks, the explosions, aborting the Moon landing, but just during the flight, I know it was cold. It was-- there was a lot of condensation. There wasn't much drinking water. There was a lot that you just had to endure from a survivability perspective. Can you tell me what was going through your mind, Fred, to push through that, and make sure that you were going to accomplish the mission and return home?  Fred Haise: Well we did, with the conditions, powering down it did get very chilly. I don't know the exact temperature in the [Lunar Excursion Module] LEM we didn't have a temperature gauge. It did freeze the water tanks in the mothership, command module. In fact, I was told they found them still frozen when they inspected the capsule after it had been recovered on the aircraft carrier. And it-- so we did the best we could. We got out our spare underwear, and so I think I had three sets of underwear on, under my garments. And Jim and I donned our lunar boots. Poor Jack didn't have a set of lunar boots, so he had to suffer a little more. Plus, he got his feet wet, with the water gun leak. So, we-- you know, we did the best we could with the clothing we had, and people ask why didn't we get in our suits? And the problem was, if you got into your suit without air hoses available to hook up for cooling, you'd perspire. Then you're worried about getting out of your suit to freeze to death if you had to go to the bathroom. And then we only had one set of hoses available. Because one set was tied up with the lithium cartridge fix. And so only one of us could have worn a suit at any given time. And I think Jim decided we should all suffer equally. So, we did not try to put on spacesuits during that period.  Jim Lovell: Poor Fred got a little sick there on the way with a little infection. So, you know, I had to keep him warm by bundling up around him. You know, I put my arms around him.  Host: [laughter] Yes. That was an important element to getting through all this, right? Was working together as a team. I'm guessing you guys were very close during, and very close after, just the sense of camaraderie to get through that, Jim.  Jim Lovell: That's right.  Host: Yes. Now here we are, you know, 50 years later talking about this again, and I'm sure you know this is absolutely not the first time you've had to sit down and talk to people and tell this story. It's just a fascinating story. Here we are 50 years later, still talking about it. You've gone through so many-- there's books, there's movies, there's all the different ways that you can learn about this mission. Is there something, whenever people are telling this story, either through a podcast or movie, something that just cannot be captured, that you think is important to share? Fred, we can start with you.  Fred Haise: Well, one direct aspect was with that cold temperature we were at, operating at a much lower power level, water sublimators which are there to capture moisture, like every time you're breathing out, you're breathing out moisture, was not able to do its job. We were well below its specifications, and water built up everywhere. We could see it in the LEM, looking through a netting wall. We couldn't afford a real wall in the LEM for weight. You could see water globules on every turn of a connector, or two-beam, and that connector interfaces is sort of shimmering there with a little vibration from the glycol pump. And when we got into the command module to power it up, we had to get towels out to wipe off the instrument panel. It was covered with water. So, a real concern was thinking about electric shorts. Well, what saved us from that, it's one of the things of accidents and tragedies is you can learn from them, that's what had happened with the Apollo 1 fire that killed the crew on the launch pad. We did a significant redesign of the command module, some structural things like the hatch. But also, a very rigid rewiring. It was specification. So, sealing that connector interfaces, which is done not just on the command module, but also the lunar modules. And so anyway, that fix that was made out of that accident, and that's since waterproofed, all of that. So, we did not suffer, probably would have suffered maybe an electric short with that water buildup everywhere. So that really effectively, the results out of an accident board in finding helped save us on 13 as well.  Host: Yes. The lessons from that. Jim, anything that you find that has not been captured that's worth sharing?  Jim Lovell: Well, yes. Of course, one of the things that occurred was the fact that we had of course used the lunar module as a life boat to get home. And that means there was three people in that lunar module for four days, and the lunar module was designed for two people for two days. And consequently, the carbon dioxide was building up because they only provided enough things to remove the carbon dioxide for two people. And so, it was getting oversaturated. The container was. And so, we had to figure out a jury-rig, and this was really the initiative on part of the Mission Control and Crew Systems Division, use the canisters in the command module, which were 1/4-inch square to fit into a facility that usually took round canisters, or oblong canisters, and this was done. And they, at mission control, they figured out how to do it. They sent up the orders to us, and the three of us put the thing together, and by God, it worked. And so, it was a perfect example of team work, and thinking sort of outside the box. But also slowing down and not trying to rush things. And we got rid of the carbon dioxide to safely get home, otherwise that would have been the end of us.  Host: Yes. Fred you talked about learning from Apollo 1, and some of the lessons learned from that redesigned the capsule that ultimately led to something that helped you survive Apollo 13. I'm sure you, thinking about what Jim was just mentioning, some of these lessons learned on Apollo 13, carbon dioxide buildup, jerry-rigging something, using existing materials. Some of these lessons from Apollo 13 needed to be carried to future missions. Do you see some of that? Did-- do you see some of that implemented? Some of the lessons learned on Apollo 13 going forward?  Fred Haise: Well, it's probably more than I can think of, but certainly the fuel cells, the next-generation fuel cells were made so they were restartable, the ones on space shuttle. Our fuel cells, Jim mentioned this. One of the first things he noticed, the fuel cells-- we had lost fuel cells. That was because the reactor valves had gotten closed by the G-shock of the explosion. And they-- and that immediately killed those fuel cells, and they were not restartable on Apollo. So, there was a different I guess specification put on the ones for space shuttle, that could be restarted. Simple things, like I'm sure later missions, I know Apollo 14 started, had some blank paper. We had no blank paper. Which was a problem for writing some of these different varieties of procedures. So that-- also mods were made on Apollo 14 to add one limb descent battery. And they also added a set of cryogenic tanks on the opposite side of the spacecraft, from the side where they were all clustered on our service module. So, you know, some things like that were, call it lessons learned that were applied downstream.  Host: Yes. Jim, did you see the same things, some of these lessons from Apollo 13 going forward, and just impacting future human spaceflight?  Jim Lovell: Oh yes. Just as Fred said, they-- fortunately they learned from mistakes and that was it. And of course, one of the things they had to do which was the cause of the accident, was back in, I think it was 1965, the spacecraft builder I had said to the people that were building these liquid oxygen tanks, to replace the thermostats in the liquid oxygen tanks from 28-volt to 40-volt, because they thought that perhaps sometime one of these spacecraft in those final stages prior to launch, and they're out at the launch site, there was available 65-volt power, and if something happened, they would like to use that ground power, rather than set up those fuel cells for ship's power. So, they wanted those thermostats changed. But unfortunately, that directive was never followed, and the 28-volt thermostats were in the fuel cells at the time-- or in the oxygen tanks, and that was really one of the items that caused the explosion eventually.  Host: Yes. Now you're both-- you know, definitely technically-minded. I see a lot of technical lessons learned, but I know even after NASA, just going through this, you both had careers in the private sector, executives. I know Fred, you were at Grumman, and Jim a number of other companies in a leadership position, in a management position. Were there values, were there lessons from Apollo 13, or from your tenure at NASA that you carried into that private sector, and into your management style and way of carrying yourself and working with teams? Fred, we'll start with you.  Fred Haise: Well, I think if you say \"leadership,\" for me probably the founding basis for me was the military. My military experience as a Marine Corps, and two different Marine fighter squadrons. And I think it was being part of a military organization that kind of got you set in the right direction for both following orders and giving orders in the right way to be a leader. And so, you know, that was kind of the foundation, I would say.  Host: So, it was those military experiences that you carried into NASA, and then carried forward from there.  Fred Haise: Yes.  Host: Yes. And Jim, were you the same way?  Jim Lovell: Yes. Basically, the same way. Of course, the military is a great place to learn leadership.  Host: Yes.  Jim Lovell: And even leadership after we got into NASA, you know and basically to-- to the Apollo, to look at it very carefully to determine the solution. Just don't jump into things, and then also you know, be comfortable to the crew if something goes on. And that's what happened on all the flights that I was on. Certainly 13 was -- we all knew what to do, and we all did it.  Host: Now you know, Apollo 13, I believe lasted six days, but you know, again, here we are 50 years later, talking about it. Can you tell me how it shaped, just the way-- the rest of your life? Maybe through family. Maybe through-- because it captured the hearts and minds of so many people, your willingness to share this story. I mean you're both here with me today, and I very much appreciate it. Fred, we'll start with you. How did those six days shape the next 50 years?  Fred Haise: I don't really think it changed much for me. I did not-- I guess I looked at flying into space as just an adjunct of my aviation and test piloting career. It was not a religious-type experience. For me it was just another great adventure. And I had no I'll call it change in mindset about things, particularly following that flight. Of course, the notoriety of that, and being an astronaut obviously helped in some ways with my career. Probably gave me the start I had at Grumman, for instance. But you know, other than that, that was a benefit, certainly.  Host: Yes.  Fred Haise: But that's about it.  Host: Now Jim, did you have something similar, or maybe something different?  Jim Lovell: Well, very similar. Similar in the fact that I never worried about problems, you know? After we got through Apollo 13, I figured that any other problem coming along were going to be, you know, survivable, and so I just didn't, didn't have a real worry about following things. And I went through, you know, various different businesses. And I ended up doing quite a bit of speaking, which brought back old memories of the flight that Fred and I were on.  Host: Yes. Now 50 years later, what we're talking about now is this Artemis generation. We're talking about returning to the Moon, but we're talking about staying. What are some of the values from, you know, working at NASA, working during the Apollo program, that you think are important to pass onto this Artemis generation, to the future generation? Fred, we'll start with you.  Fred Haise: Well, I'll have to say what I know about Artemis and the program in any detail is only what I get from the media.  Host: Oh sure.  Fred Haise: As I-- I really am just interested in there being a continuation of exploration. And there's been a lot of arguments about whether go back to the Moon or go to Mars. But I'm happy that there'll be some sustenance in tackling it this way. Little-- I think they're going at it a little different way. More launches required than-- we had one launch to do it. I think there are several launches involved in Artemis, in the plans. But otherwise that's what-- just I hope it continues and rejuvenates people that are working here at NASA at the various sites that are supporting it to make it all happen. And have the continued support through Congress and the administration.  Host: What about exploration is so valuable?  Fred Haise: Well, I think it's valuable certainly from things that we learn just from Earth observations. There's that part of it as well. Learning about our Earth and protecting it, and knowing about things here, but otherwise, very, very long-term, there's obviously a concern about the survivability of the human race. We've had major extinctions on Earth. Hopefully none very soon again, but there's something to be said that we should use some part of this talent we're blessed with. Because we humans are uniquely able to go outward and to explore that. So far at least, no other critters have showed up that think they could do that.  Host: Yes.  Fred Haise: So, it's kind of a blessing that we have, and the ability we've been given by the creator that we should maybe use our talent in that direction.  Host: Now Jim, your thoughts about this next-- this future of exploration.  Jim Lovell: Well, I think the future of exploration has a lot to do with the makeup of the people that are growing up, again the children. I have met a lot of people, you know, in their 40s and 50s now that said, look it, I followed the program when I was just a kid, and that sort of got me into engineering, or into something else like that. And so, the space program was essentially an incentive to a lot of people who liked what we were doing in space as they were children, and then followed their dreams to do something else. Not so much go into NASA or anything like that, but actually accomplishing something because of what we accomplished.  Host: Yes. Do you think that's important? To make sure there's this sense of inspiration, either through, you know, space exploration, or other avenues? That sense of inspiring, you know, STEM fields, and people to go into more technical careers?  Jim Lovell: That's right. I think the space program has incentive to a lot of people to get into technical businesses, engineering, or something of this nature. And outside from the physical, you know, introduction of new science and new engineering, and new things that we deal with now every day. You know, the communications, and the computer technology, and things of this nature.  Host: Yes. Fred, what inspired you to do something more technical, you flying aircraft, what inspired you to pursue that career?  Fred Haise: The Korean War.  Host: Oh yes.  Fred Haise: Yes. I was actually-- first two years of college, I was going to be a journalist.  Host: Oh!  Fred Haise: And was majoring in journalism. And the Korean War had come along, and I decided to serve my country, and the program I went into was a naval aviation cadet program. And became a pilot. So that caused a 90-degree turn, because I love flying, and I said that's now my career. Somehow, it's going to be in aviation.  Host: [laughter] Now Jim, what was your inspiration to pursue that path?  Jim Lovell: Well, just about the same thing. Of course, the wars-- I've got to do the naval aviation when I graduated from the Naval Academy. And then was, you know, it was squadrons in between the wars, and then just before the-- I guess it was Vietnam at that time, that I got into the space program.  Host: Yes. I'm sure you both return to NASA occasionally, every once in a while. What do you see when you return here? How things have shaped over 50 years? Fred, we'll start with you.  Fred Haise: Well, I'm here really not any more-- as a visitor I'd say at JSC. I'm not involved, have not been involved technically, except of some of the contracts I had when I was at Northrop Grumman, which is not since 1996 now. But anyway, I obviously come here to the campus, and of course, I see a lot of these added security features. That's happened everywhere I guess.  Host: Sure.  Fred Haise: The government installations since 9/11. But otherwise, I come to support the summer of aerospace scholar groups. I've been here to talk to teacher groups that meet here, and events over at Space Center Houston through the year, since I live here in Houston. It's convenient, and I've supported still supported NASA in that way, more in the education area.  Host: Jim, what about you?  Jim Lovell: Well, I you know-- JSC has always been the place where I, you know, had all my experiences and everything. As a matter of fact, we were going to have a 50th anniversary of Apollo 13 there at JSC, but it happened to be on the Saturday between Good Friday and Easter, and Krantz decided that wasn't the thing to do. So, then I can't go down to the new time, and so Fred-o, you're going to have to take over for me if you're going to go to that. [Laughter]  Fred Haise: Alright.  Host: Yes. No, we are at the 50th anniversary. I'm sure you're getting a lot of these requests to come and talk about it. Thinking about this anniversary, the golden anniversary of Apollo 13, what do you think is the legacy of Apollo 13? Jim, we'll start with you.  Jim Lovell: Well, the legacy is that essentially don't give up. Or essentially look at a problem in all aspects to try to solve it. Thirteen was a classic example of that. But through all of life, and throughout in people, there's a probable time that are similar to what we had on 13. And you must, you know, have a positive attitude.  Host: Your thoughts, Fred?  Fred Haise: I think it's simply the slogan if you will, that's come out and is used in a lot of ways I see these days, that came out in the movie about Apollo 13. And that was, failure is not an option.  Host: Yes. [laughter] That is true. I love that. Gentlemen, any final thoughts before we part ways? Now thinking about-- now that we've been talking about Apollo 13, that we're approaching this 50th anniversary, any final thoughts? Jim, I'll pass it over to you first.  Jim Lovell: No, I think that-- that I'd like to see the program continue as long as it provides positive results to help our country and help the world. I enjoyed my tenure in the space program. And I hope that other people do the same.  Host: Wonderful. Now, Fred?  Fred Haise: I don't think I have anything to add to what Jim said. I just hope the program, it will be continued to be supported. And we can move forward and be at the Moon first. Let's go do the Moon.  Host: [laughter] Well, gentlemen, it has been such an honor and a privilege to talk to you today on the 50th anniversary of Apollo 13. Just really appreciate your time, and I wish you the best of luck in these next couple months, as everyone else is going to be asking for your time as well, and for the future. Thank you so much, gentlemen.  Jim Lovell: Well, thank you for the call.  Fred Haise: Alright. Thank you.  [ Music ]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 155, “Artemis Moon Tools.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. We are returning human presence to the Moon, this time in a sustainable way through the Artemis program. Humans will soon be exploring the surface of the Moon, but this time in different and interesting locations near the lunar poles and for longer periods of time, all with the goal in mind of learning more about the Moon and how to live and work on Mars. And while we're improving the techniques of living and working on the Moon, we have a lot of exploring to do. These interesting locations on the Moon can help us understand more about our planet and its history, and a better understanding of what makes up the Moon’s surface could improve how we live off of its resources. Now, with new places to explore come new tools we need to develop in order to explore them and new challenges that we need to overcome. So, to describe these new tools that will be used for Artemis are Trevor Graff and Adam Naids. Trevor is the Jacobs Chief Scientist and Project Manager for exploration science within the Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science Division, or ARES, here at the Johnson Space Center. He describes the interesting geology of these locations on the Moon and the challenges of collecting samples. Adam is the Deputy Project Manager for Artemis geology tools. He's the one designing the tools to overcome these challenges and be user-friendly to future moonwalkers. So, here we go, the next generation of tools for the next generation of moonwalkers with Trevor Graff and Adam Naids. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Trevor and Adam, thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.  Adam Naids: Yeah, thanks for having us.  Trevor Graff: Glad to be here.  Host: This is quite a topic here, “Artemis Moon Tools.” Now, honestly, I'll be completely honest, I really don't know too much about the history of tools. So, I kind of want to start with that, but before we even get to that, I want to know just who we're talking to, because we are doing a little bit of the tool side and a little bit of the science side. Adam, we'll start with you. Tell us about yourself and what you do.  Adam Naids: Yeah, Gary, so I'm the Deputy Project Manager for the Artemis geology tools, and so I help to lead a team of people who are designing and building and testing the next generation tools that we're going to send to the Moon to bring back samples. I -- my degree was in engineering physics from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, and I'm fortunate to be in the position I'm in and excited to be working on such an awesome project.  Host: Yeah, what a title, man, working on future tools deputy manager, very, very cool. And you started as a co-op like me, and if I remember correctly, we created a little video called “NASA Johnson Style,” I think it's got a couple hits on YouTube.  Adam Naids: Yeah, just a couple of hits. Gary, that was an amazing time, and it was really cool to share what we're doing with the public, and so I'm excited to do that again for a different topic.  Host: Very cool, alright. Well, it's good to at least hear your voice again during this pandemic, but I'm glad to have you on. Now, Trevor, how about you? A little bit about yourself.  Trevor Graff: Yeah, thanks, Gary. Jacobs Chief Scientist and Project Manager for like exploration science-related things within the Astromaterials Research and Exploration Division, or ARES, here at JSC. And so, I'm -- for the tool’s projects, I'm kind of the science liaison to Adam's team to help infuse the science into the types of tools that Adam and his team are building. I started at JSC almost well over 20 years ago as an intern and then went off to get my graduate degree at Arizona State University, where I worked on Mars rovers for quite a bit after that. So, I did a lot with the Mars rovers and building instrumentation for the Mars rovers and commanding some instruments on the Mars rovers, and so I found my way back to JSC seven or eight years ago, and I've been working in ARES at JSC and just getting more and more involved in the human side and the aspects of science that play into that. So, this tools project has been super exciting to get involved in, thinking about, you know, the application of using the tools and doing science on the Moon once again.  Host: I'm curious to hear more about that. You said more on the human side of science. So, talk about that relationship, the how geology meets the human side.  Trevor Graff: Yeah, so, you know, I talked about the Mars rover. So, a lot of what I've been doing is, you know, the robotic side of that is like using the Mars rovers as robotic geology explorers on the surface of Mars. And so, it's very interesting for me to like make this flip from, you know, the slow pace and the detailed science that the robotic instruments have been doing on the surface of Mars to thinking about how humans can use the tools and do the sample collection and how rapid that makes the process and how integrative that can be. And so, that slip from the robotic world that -- where my head has been for a number of years with Mars is really fun to now think about the human aspect of, you know, humans being the explorers and doing that again on the lunar surface is really exciting here in the next few years.  Host: Now, Trevor, you got a little taste of this on an undersea mission called [NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations] NEEMO. Can you describe a little bit what that is and what you did and how that kind of relates to what you're talking about?  Trevor Graff: Sure. So, NEEMO is this project that occurs off the coast of Florida at an underwater habitat that sits down at 62 feet in the sand off the coast, about five kilometers off of Key Largo. And so, NEEMO itself is NASA's extreme environment mission operations, and [inaudible] analog with [inaudible] scientists and engineers down to that habitat to live and work, as they are, you know, analogous to space. So, the habitat itself is kind of the size of like an ISS node, and then we go from the habitat out into the surrounding area or the reef and do science. And so, we do that all analogous of the types of things that we would do on the lunar surface or on the Mars surface, and we talk to a backroom team and Mission Control. And so, it's really a fantastic analog for the types of things that we do or thinking about doing, you know, on other planetary surfaces. So, I had the opportunity in 2017 to be part of one of those crews on the NEEMO cruise, so NEEMO 22 and got an awesome opportunity to be part of that. And that's also, you know, through this process of NEEMO is where kind of me and Adam started to meet and started talking about tools. So, a lot of these tool things that we've talked about today initiated because of analog missions, like NEEMO or [Desert Research and Technology Studies] Desert RATS and things like that in the past. So, it's fun to see how this has grown over the years.  Host: That is incredible. I'm trying to imagine what it's like to live underwater. How would you describe it to someone who has no idea what it's like to live in a confined space, and you can even call it an extreme environment for its own reasons, because it is -- it's not just, you know, “I'm tired of being here, I'm going to walk out the door.” It's for a reason that you're underwater.  Trevor Graff: Yeah, that's exactly that, Gary. It's very, very analogous to space, just because you need the life support system to be even able to survive, right? So, in the habitat or when you go out in the water column and go out on these simulated EVAs, you need that life support system, and it makes it extreme, right? There's all the things that you need to think about to stay safe, and there's all the things that you need to think about to be able to communicate well as a team, as a crew, all the way back to mission control. And so, you know, it was a fantastic opportunity to live and work down there. I'm passionate about diving and things like that. So, it really scratched the itch for me for numerous reasons, being, you know, a space nerd but then also love and passionate about diving. And so, it's just fantastic and it -- the biggest takeaway I had just looking out the window of the habitat, you know, each day is how unique our Earth is, our environment is, and how unique all the creatures are, you know, looking out the window at the fish life and how it changes throughout the day and things like that were just fantastic, and it was an awesome opportunity.  Host: What a great experience, unbelievable, and, Adam, you said you -- or Trevor mentioned that he kind of met you in the NEEMO world. Tell me about your experience.  Adam Naids: Yeah, so the last, I mean, decade or more we've been thinking about going back to the Moon and going to Mars and how we would do that. And so, NEEMO has been a place where we've been able to think about those things, build prototypes, and put it into action and learn. And so, I've been a part of six NEEMO missions now, and it's just been an awesome opportunity, as Trevor said, to think about these things, to cross train in other disciplines, like, for me, cross training and scientists and understanding what they care about and cross training in operations and what it means to operate the tools. And so, it's just been a really amazing experience there to just be ready for a moment like this, where now we've been charged with going back to the Moon for Artemis and then onto Mars, and we just -- now we're just taking what we've learned, taking those relationships that we've built and putting it into action to do it for real.  Host: You talked about we're thinking about the Moon, and it's happening right now, and here's the thing, we've been to the Moon before, right? So, this is -- we're talking about the Apollo era. We're talking about the ‘70s. Let's take a journey through history, Adam. Take us through some of the early Apollo era collection tools, their purpose, and a little bit about what we have already done in the past.  Adam Naids: Yeah, I'm happy to do that. You know, we've been to the Moon six times, and we've learned a lot each one of those missions. Early on, you know, science wasn't necessarily embedded in the Apollo program, and it took some fighting to make that happen, or I should say lobbying, and it obviously became a kind of cornerstone of the program throughout. And so, bringing back samples is huge, a huge part of those science objectives. They also brought instruments and other -- and did some other studies while they were on the Moon, but they brought back samples. And so, they developed a suite of tools to do that. Early on, there was just a couple of tools, but that repertoire increased throughout the missions. Some of the tools that we brought were things like a shovel or a scoop, these things called tongs, which are just grabbers that you can use to pick up rocks off of the ground. We brought things like core tubes to get cylindrical samples of the soil of the lunar regolith, I should say, to bring back, to study the layers of the Moon. And so, those are just a couple of the early tools that were used, and they were able to bring back some great samples that are still being studied today.  Host: Now, they sound kind of simple, right, when you say it. You're talking scoops and shovels, I have those in my garage right now, but what is the key element when you're designing a tool that makes it something that is usable on a different planetary or Moon lunar surface?  Adam Naids: Yeah, that's a great question, Gary. I get that a lot. “Hey, you're just making a hammer, like what's so hard about making a space hammer? Like, why don't you just go to your local hardware store and fly that?” There's a couple of reasons. One is the environmental conditions. So, temperature being a major one, we have some temperature extremes that we have to account for. The other thing is designing for an astronaut in a spacesuit, and the spacesuit is essentially a balloon, and you have to squeeze against that balloon every time you grab something. And so, we need to make -- we need to think about human factors a lot and ensuring that these tools are easy to use, and they can be used without causing the astronaut a lot of pain or exertion, and that way they can do more. The last part of this has to do with contamination. So, what we want to do for the scientists across the world is bring back samples that are pristine, that aren't contaminated with things that aren't from the Moon. And so, that is a major driver for everything that we do on the ground in terms of processing the tools, selecting the materials for the tools. So, we can only use certain materials. We have to make sure that our material finishes -- are approved by the science community. We have to go through a cleaning process to make sure that we remove any contaminants from the tools, and then we have to maintain that cleanliness along the way. And so, that's something we don't have a lot of experience with in our recent history. So, we're spending a lot of time getting smart on that right now.  Host: Now, Trevor, I'm going to toss it over to you. We're talking about some -- these tools that are designed for the Moon. They sound relatively simple. Talk about the geological perspective of this, why you use these tools, perhaps in the field on Earth and then why you want them for the Moon?  Trevor Graff: Yeah, well, Adam hit on, you know, a lot of things there. Those tools are kind of what I would use if I go out in the field today to, you know, collect rocks and samples to do terrestrial or Earth-based, you know, study. And so, you know, I'm a geologist at heart. So, I love my rock hammer and stuff, and so that's always in my backpack when I go out to do fieldwork. And so, when we go to think about doing that type of stuff on another planetary body, like the Moon and or eventually on to Mars, those are the things, those, you know, those generally simple tools, if you will, are part of that kit that is really going to help us collect the samples, as Adam said, to get them back in a pristine state, so that we can do the scientific research back here in the labs that we have, both at JSC but also around the world to study these samples and learn the scientific knowledge that are our objectives of going back to the surface. And so, you know, of that, I think there's 382 kilograms or 840 some pounds of lunar rocks and soil and regolith that we brought back during the Apollo era. That has been a wealth, a treasure trove of scientific knowledge that people have been working on for decades and learning a lot about not only the Moon but the solar system and our Earth planetary system, the Earth/Moon system. And so, those samples become critical to get back in as pristine a state that we can, and one of the other things to mention on that, you know, Adam's tool or tool team is also building beyond just the hammers and the rakes and the scoops and the tongs is the containers to package these things in. And that's not an easy task either, right? So, there's the bags, and then there's what they used to call it during the Apollo days, a rock box, and then there's, you know, stowage bags and the containers to bring all this stuff back, not only when you're out on EVA and sampling, but, you know, it's got to go into the HLS system or the Human Landing System and then back on Orion and back, you know, to Earth and ultimately get into building 31, where our lunar sample collection is and, you know, and then gets distributed from there. So, a lot to think about on the return aspects and the containers that the samples go in.  Host: For a non-geologist like myself, you know, you're looking out on the Moon and some of these pictures, and it just looks like a field of gray. But I know that from your eye, from a geological perspective, there is important elements to all these different pieces. I know a story from some of the early Apollo missions, I think it was Neil Armstrong, filled up a container full of rocks and then found that there was empty space, so he started scooping some soil in there, some loose dirt, and that ended up being super valuable. So, talk about the different things that we can find on the Moon, even something, some lessons learned from Apollo about what things we find important, some of these core tubes, some rocks, some soil. What's cool about all these things?  Trevor Graff: Yeah, I mean, the Moon looks gray at first blush, and, you know, but there is some really unique things, you know, like you said, you know, back to the Apollo mission, again, that they found that were very unique like the, you know, the orange soil for Apollo 17 or the, you know, a lot of impact debris and things like that from different missions. And so, you know, if you look up at the Moon, you see, you know, the light and dark areas, and so the lighter surface areas are these lunar highlands, and the darker places are the mare. And so, these highlands are mostly what geologists call anorthosite or anorthositic in composition, and the mare, those darker places when you look up the Moon are basaltic, so, but that's a very general simplimatic way of looking at it. You know, once you get on the surface, you can find all kinds of, you know, geologic unique things to study that tell us, like I said, about our solar system as a whole, tell us about the Earth/Moon system, and tell us about, you know, different scientific applications for fundamental physics and things like that. So, getting back to the surface in new unique places and doing, you know, the field work that we're used to doing here on Earth, but applying that to the Moon and all those lessons learned from Apollo all apply in learning more about, you know, our solar system and beyond.  Host: Now, Adam, some of these tools, you mentioned early on, that these tools were, you know, the science part came a little bit later in the Apollo mission. I think, you know, during -- the goal was really to get to the surface of the Moon to get those boot prints, but we must have learned a lot from designing the tools, what worked, what didn't work. So, what are we taking from the Apollo missions and then applying to Artemis?  Adam Naids: Yeah, great question. So, leading into this work, really, for the last, you know, decade, we've been doing some research about Apollo. What did they do? What did they learn? Just at a lower level. Now that we're funded to start developing the tools for Artemis, we kicked that into overdrive. And so, we worked with Trevor and his organization who has a data center with a lot of historical documents from Apollo, and we spent lots of time reading documents in there. We reached out to the JSC History Office to go and find whatever documents related to tools we possibly could and just trying to get -- gather as much -- soak in as much knowledge as we could about what they did and what worked well. There was pretty good recordkeeping. They did debriefs for each mission, and we can find quotes from the astronauts about what issues that they had with tools and things that they liked and disliked. So, we really soaked all of that in and kind of collected that information per tool and are then literally handing those documents to our designers now to implement some of those things. And we get a question -- this question a lot where people say, “well, why spend money designing new tools, let's just fly the Apollo ones, like we have the drawings, just build those and fly those?” And then we also get the question that's like, “well, let's make super fancy tools, this the 21st century, you know? Let's make them way better than Apollo,” and to -- in reality, we're doing a little bit of both. For example, there's a tool called the drive tube, and that you -- that they hammered into the ground to collect a core sample. That tool evolved multiple times throughout the six Apollo missions that landed on the Moon, and we can see that, and then it remains steady the last couple of missions. So, it appears that they got that design right, and it worked the way they wanted it to. So, why should we change that? And so, that's kind of a starting point for us -- is let's see what we can remake this design, let's go test it in the new environment of the poles and see if that works and then make any other adjustments based upon, you know, modern manufacturing practices or something like that. And then there's other things that just that are simple but deserve another look, and, you know, with everything that we know, you know, 60 years later, we can implement that to make the tools lighter, more efficient, easier to use. And so, we're trying to kind of do a combination of that to make this toolkit really useful and easy for the astronauts.  Host: Wonderful. This is so exciting. Let's jump right to Artemis. Trevor, when we're doing an Artemis mission, what is the lay of the land there? How does it compare to Apollo? What are the interesting parts of these landing sites, that you as a geologist want to explore?  Trevor Graff: Yeah, so Artemis has us really excited to get to the surface near the South Pole, like we've been directed to go. And so, you know, I talked a little bit about the light areas and the dark areas and those of the Moon and those lighter areas being lunar highlands or this material called anorthosite. And so, that's what we expect to find there, but, like we talked about, you know, there's always surprises that can come along. And so, we expect to find a lot like Apollo 16 went to a highlands area -- it was the only Apollo mission that went to a region of highland-like material, and so we expect that, but we're always ready for exciting new finds and different discoveries. At the South Pole, some of the challenges, though, are going to be some of these shadowed regions, and that's the real reason why we're going is for the volatiles there at the South Pole or the North Pole that are present on the Moon in the polar regions. And so, we're really excited that Artemis is headed in that direction to go find these things as resources, right? So, the idea here with Artemis is not only just to go, you know, forward to the Moon and return there, but also to think about how to do it in a sustained way. And so, how do we use the resources that we find on the lunar surface, some of those resources being like the Sun, the illumination, you know, for power, but also resources like what we hope to find in some of these shadowed regions for volatiles. Some of that could be water that we possibly could use to be able to be -- keep a sustained presence on the lunar surface and then think about how that all applies to, you know, future human presence on like the surface of Mars, for example.  Host: Now, things like that, things like volatiles, when you're looking at that, is -- maybe that's perhaps a little bit different from things that we were collecting or samples we were collecting during the Apollo era. So, what information are you providing to Adam that says, “hey, when you get to this site, you're going to have to deal with these volatiles, these ices, and that means you're going to need this kind of tool, and it's going to need this kind of specifications.” What information are you passing onto Adam?  Trevor Graff: Yeah, great question, and that's that real curveball that we've kind of thrown at the tools team from the Apollo missions, are these permanently shadowed regions and trying to think about sampling those and how to get the samples, you know, collected in the correct way, or, you know, the way that we think is correct and all the way back to the surface of Earth, so that we can study them and learn more about them to go and then ultimately use them as a resource. And so, there's been a number of missions at the lunar surface, orbital missions that have been characterizing those, all the way back, you know, since the late ‘90s, or, you know, with different orbiters that started to identify that, “hey, look, there's something special with these polar regions.” And that's what led to the launch of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter or LRO in -- it was around 2009, I believe, at launch, and it's been there for almost a decade now. And that has a number of instruments on it that are collecting data from all over the Moon, but specifically, there was a number of instruments on that orbiter that are collecting data about the volatiles and the uniqueness of the South Pole environment. So, we're trying to --scientific community synthesize all those results to the things that Adam's team can use to actually then build the tools to sample them correctly or at least how we think we need to sample them to understand them better, and so that process is ongoing. It's involving a lot of people at different centers and a lot of people across the scientific community, and it involves other people in ARES, that organization that I come from and the curation aspect. And so, they're thinking about how, you know, how do you curate these things and understand them, because ultimately, we really need to understand them to be able to use them as a resource. And so, we're doing our best as a scientific community to pull all that information together and get it to the tool’s folks, and it's been a great collaboration in a way that we've been integrating very closely recently.  Host: Very cool. So, Adam, what's one of the early things that you already know -- one of the early challenges you know you're going to have to deal with for Artemis missions when designing these tools?  Adam Naids: Yeah, that's a great question. So, the biggest challenges we're seeing right now is operating in these PSRs, these permanently shadowed regions and getting the volatiles, as Trevor mentioned. The types of compounds that are frozen into the regolith, you know, there can be some chemical interactions with our tools that we have to be careful of. And so, we may have to coat our tools with special finishes to make sure that those chemical reactions don't happen. The other thing is that these compounds are frozen, right? And so, as they heat up, they will turn to from a solid to a liquid and then to a liquid to a gas, and they get to the gas phase pretty quickly. And so, you know, the scientists ideally would be able to get the samples back still frozen, not in their gas form, and so there's lots of conversation going on about how to do that and how to provide a freezer for the samples to go in. But some of it, those compounds will become gaseous, and so back to what Trevor was talking about, the sample containers. We're going to have to design these containers to contain that gas, so that the scientists can study it on the ground and contain it to protect the astronaut, because some of those compounds may be harmful. And so, that's kind of one of the big things that are standing out right now, but we have a huge team across the center and agency kind of talking about it and figuring out what that looks like.  Host: See. [Laughter] it's not as simple as a, you know, if I'm thinking about a geological expedition, you're going out, you're collecting a rock, you put that rock in a bag, and it stays a rock. Now you have to plan for that thing that you're picking up to change it, and that's a very interesting challenge. One of those things you got to deal with in space, absolutely incredible. So, I want to move on to the operations here. We're talking about going down to the surface of the Moon, the tools you have to use. What -- talk about the -- I'll pass it back to you, Adam, the operations of an Artemis mission, what you're expecting with a certain lander to be able to have a certain amount of room to take a certain number of tools and be able to lift off from that surface with a certain amount of mass. How are you planning for those operations?  Adam Naids: Yeah, I mean, we could have a whole podcast about this. So, I'll talk about the big stuff. Just all the things you mentioned, you know, we have to -- we have a limited mass to send our tools down. Then once we're there, we're going to have to figure out how do we manage all this equipment? So, we have to take it out of either the astronauts have to bring it out with them, where it's stowed externally to the vehicle and they can go pull it out of the lockers when they get to the surface, they got to attach some of this stuff to them, put it in their tool carrier or something like that, and then they're essentially ready to go, but all -- I kind of went through that pretty quickly. But figuring out how to manage all the tools is a huge challenge and is one of our top risks I would say that we're trying to address right now. How do we bring all this stuff around with us? But once we figure that part out, we'll be -- the astronaut will be a geologist, and they'll go out and do some science, will take pictures of the samples. They'll be communicating verbally to a whole team of scientists on the ground, what they're seeing, and there's this back and forth communication that will continue to happen about what samples are of interest and making sure that we're staying within our limit of samples to bring home, because we're mass limited there. We can't just pick up everything, or the astronauts can't pick up every sample that they see. So, there's going to be this high grading process where they go about. It's just prioritizing, figuring out which samples they actually want to obtain and bring back, but to keep it simple, they'll go out, they'll take these pictures, they'll pick up some of the samples with our tools, put them in the sample containers, and then they'll end their spacewalk. At the end of the spacewalk, we're going to want to bring those rocks inside in case we have to leave in a hurry, and we're going to have to weigh those samples to make sure that we know that we haven't busted our math allocation. So, we'll have to have some sort of scale to do that as well. So, there's kind of a quick run through of what kind of a single EVA could look like.  Host: Yeah, quick but absolutely fascinating. I was locked onto the tools on the external lockers. I just think that's such a good idea. It's something I wouldn't even think about right off the bat, but if you're thinking about tools, these tools are in the dust, and perhaps you want A, easy access to those tools, but B, you don't want to track extra dust into the cabin where the astronauts are going to be. So, storing them on the outside is just a great idea. You know, I'm excited to see where some of these ideas go and how they evolve.  Adam Naids: Yeah, and absolutely, Gary, the dust is something that I haven't touched on a lot, but that is a major concern across the agency is just how to manage dust. And we did it successfully during Apollo. We know we can do better this time around, and we have really smart people thinking about how to do that. Our team is also working on some dust and mitigation tools, so things like brushes or things like that to help the astronauts get the dust off of them before they go in, back inside the lander. And then there's other smart things that we can do about how we're managing the samples and other things that are dirty, so that we don't -- we minimize the amount of dust we're bringing back into the cabin.  Host: Interesting. Now, Trevor, I'm sure from your perspective, you did mention for Artemis there is this goal of a sustainable presence, and I believe after multiple trips to the Moon, it'll be kind of like Apollo, where you're staying longer and you're doing cooler things. So, I'm sure you're looking forward to some of those later missions. Talk about from your perspective, from your priorities as a geologist during these later missions when geology -- when operations become, my gosh, this will be awesome, when operations become quote unquote “routine,” and you can explore further out and do better things. What are some of those geological goals that you're looking forward to for some of the later Artemis missions?  Trevor Graff: Yeah, great question, and it, really, for geology, it comes down to mobility, right, and being able to in place, I guess the second thing would be able to in place, you know, smarter and better equipment or scientific payloads out there. So, on that first topic, like the mobility of getting to new geologic units, things that may, you know, you might not have time to do based on the limitations of how many EVAs you can do or spacewalks you can do or how far you could go. And so, increasing that mobility as the Artemis missions mature is going to be really important for science and getting to new locations or different PSRs or different geologic units. And so, the mobility may come in the form of, you know, rovers, like they had in, you know, Apollo or, you know, pressurized rovers that we've seen in different analog environments and that people have talked about for a long time. Mobility also comes in the form of the [Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit] xEMU or the new suit that they're building, the, you know, the next generation spacesuit. And so, that allows us to do other things like deploy instruments a lot more efficiently, and so by instruments it's kind of a different version of the tools that we're talking about now, but like the instruments can be similar to like the Mars rovers that I talked about earlier. These instruments that are -- tell you a lot more about the surface as you explore, and so, you know, they can -- basically miniaturized all these lab -- huge lab-based instruments over the past decades to where they're now small enough and light enough to send them to planetary surface to learn about things in-situ or as you're there. And so, that's going to be very important to deploy these instruments and other things, you know, that maybe kind of out of the realm of geology but more in the realm of astrophysics or, you know, or deploying telescopes and things like that on the Moon that may actually really help those types of sciences as well.  Host: My gosh, how are you not excited for some of the things that are happening for Artemis? This is absolutely fascinating. Adam let's dive into what we're thinking about so far. You mentioned some Apollo heritage tools that work just fine, and yeah, let's just pull those right from the archives and develop some of those talk about some of the tools that you're looking at right now at developing.  Adam Naids: Yeah, so right now we're working on eight tools. These are kind of the baseline tools, the simpler ones, a lot of which flew in Apollo, but we're making some improvements to them. So, tongs, scoop, rake, we're working on sample bags. We're working on the drive tube, and we're working on an extension handle, which is a common handle that can interface with different end effectors. So, we don't have to fly a whole bunch of long handles. So, those are kind of, I don't know, if I got all eight, but those are some of the tools that we're working on right now. But we've -- we're communicating with the programs and trying to figure out what other tools we need, and so we have a list of these potential tools that will hopefully get the start here in the next few months. But at the end of the day, there's going to be dozens and dozens of tools that are created, some by our team, some by others across the country, but we're just getting started, Gary.  Host: Well, that's very exciting. Now, these tools that you're developing, I'm sure there's a certain amount of testing that you have to undergo to make sure that they are ready, even making sure that they're compatible with these suits that the astronauts are going to be wearing when they're doing the moonwalking, which is a challenge in and of itself. So, describe some of those things that you're working on too.  Adam Naids: Absolutely. Testing is the most important thing, and we just need to get experience, and we just got to do. We talk a lot, but time talking is good, planning is good, but at some point, we got to just go and do and test. And so, we try to have a culture of prototype early, prototype often, and test early, and test often, and Trevor and I were on a meeting this morning where we're trying to plan a small, low key test of this next generation of tool prototypes that we've created out at the rock yard that we have at JSC. It's just -- it's a yard that has a bunch of rocks in it, and it looks like the Moon, and there's a Mars part too. And so, we're going to do a simulated spacewalk, and we're going to use the tools, and we're going to get feedback on them. And so, we're doing things like that unsuited, so without a spacesuit, and then we're also doing testing in a lab environment of the spacesuit prototypes as well. So, we have test subjects, sometimes engineers like myself, sometimes scientists like Trevor, and then ultimately the astronauts as these test subjects who are giving us feedback of our tools in that environment. So, we go there. We also go to the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory. If NEEMOs continued to happen, the NEEMO missions will go out there, and so our team is involved in a lot of different testing. Our, really, our whole EVA community is involved in a lot of testing right now, and those are the -- it's really fun. It's really fun to get out there, but that's where we do most of our learning.  Host: Fantastic, really pedal to the metal here. So, Trevor, from your perspective, I'm sure these samples you know, we talk about all these cool things that we can find on the Moon, but we got to bring them back. So, talk about some of the ways that we're preparing the Johnson Space Center for when these Artemis samples come back to Earth, and we want to keep them preserved and study them with the instruments we have here.  Trevor Graff: Yeah, a lot of work is currently happening right now, spinning all that up. As you can imagine, a lot is spinning up with Artemis, and so the Apollo curators and, you know, the new generation of people thinking about Artemis curation samples have really been discussing, you know, how to do it better, how to, you know, lessons learn from Apollo, what types of materials we can use, as Adam talked about before, how to store these, how to allocate them out to the world, you know, once we get them. All that planning is currently in work and really excited and to think about, and it really touches this project, you know, the building of the tools and the containers pretty closely. So, lots of conversations going on currently about how to do all this and make sure it's all synced up in one nice integrated package.  Host: Very cool. Now, Adam, I know, you know, you have a fantastic group that's all putting their brains into how we can best design tools. I believe you're also involving students in some capacity to think about maybe unique or innovative ideas that you may not have thought of before. So, what's that program, and what's that like?  Adam Naids: Yeah, absolutely. There's a program called the Microgravity NExT Program. Microgravity – I will just leave it at that, Microgravity NExT, and this started, I think we're in the sixth year of it now, if I remember correctly, and what we do is we take real challenges that our tools team is working on, along with challenges from other people across the agency. And we put those out to university students across the country, and so they get to submit a proposal of, in our case, a tool design. Our team, myself included, review every single proposal and then along with some of our community members, and we rate these, we rate them, and then a certain number of them will be selected to actually build their tool and then come here to NASA to the Neutral Buoyancy Lab to test their tool out. And so, it'll be tested by test subjects. The team gets to stay in the control center and direct the test and talk to the subject in real-time. So, it is, number one, a really cool experience for the students to learn what it's like to be on the team and to design something from beginning to end and to be involved in testing it. And then for us, we get lots of ideas. It's a way for us to crowdsource design, and so this current year, it started last August, we got feedback and of the -- or we got some of the proposals submitted in November of last year, which is just at the same time our design team was spinning up to think about designs for our Artemis tools. And so, we literally sent the student's proposal over to our designers for consideration, and so some of those ideas may or may not have been incorporated, but it's a really cool pipeline to get university students working on real challenges.  Host: Unbelievable. So, if you're a student and you want to design a tool that's going to be actually used on the Moon or inform designs that can be used on the Moon, that's the program you want to check out Micro-G NExT. Trevor, I'll pass it over to you. Artemis, we're talking about the Moon, and there's a lot of work going into here, but it is geological exploration, and you're designing these tools to work on and to explore different bodies in our solar system. There's got to be applications to Mars here. So, what are those things that you're thinking about, even as we're designing for Artemis? What's on your mind for Mars?  Trevor Graff: Yeah, I mean, almost everything we talked about has applications to Mars. So, the samples and the thinking about contamination control and, you know, the materials we use and the temperatures and the -- and how it -- how these things interface with the suit and the tool transport and the tool management, as Adam talked about, every single thing is applicable to Mars missions. And so, you know, my head has been in the Mars game for a long time with the robotic missions I talked about. So, I'm excited to eventually, you know, think about getting to that point, but, you know, right now our focus is on the lunar stuff and then keeping an eye on the prize at the end with Mars missions and how all this stuff applies to that. And so, you know, Mars is very geologically diverse, and so from a geologic science standpoint, we're really excited to eventually get there and think -- and see all the exploration and opportunities that Mars science will bring us.  Host: Very cool. Well, Trevor, I got a big question for you. We haven't had boots on the surface of the Moon since 1972, and we're going to be going back in the very near future. So, that first mission is going to be a big one, and I'm sure you as a scientist are eager for something on the Moon. So, I want your recommendation for Artemis -- for the Artemis mission that's going to land boots on the Moon. What do you, as a geologist want to bring back? What is the number one priority tool or thing that you want from that mission?  Trevor Graff: The priority tool to me would be to take a rock hammer, so to go and just because I'm a geologist at heart, I want to take a rock hammer and be able to bring back some of that material from the lunar surface, you know, from a nearby crater or boulder. But, you know, the number one priority for the science, I would say, is driving us to go to the South Pole, is getting some of these volatiles back in some of our labs, so that we can understand, you know, the dynamics of them, the components of those volatile samples and then think about how we can use them in a sustainable way to continue these Artemis missions into the future, right? So, these early Artemis missions are just a springboard into a sustainable presence on the lunar surface and then on to Mars. So, those volatiles and ISRU are the, you know, how to live off the land. The resources are really the things that are going to take it to the next level and keep a sustainable presence on other planetary surfaces. So, that's what I really would like to see.  Host: Very, very exciting. Adam, what about you? You have a lot of people working on these tools. What's the thing you're looking forward to most for getting to the Moon?  Adam Naids: For me, it's just the image of seeing the astronauts being able to take a sample. Actually, really what will make me the happiest is that we get just one, even if it's just one sample back here on Earth that is useful to the scientists. We definitely don't take our responsibility here lightly, and we want to make sure that we're doing everything we can that our tools bring back samples that are pristine and that scientists around the world can study for really decades to come.  Host: Wonderful, and I know, you know, you talked about just seeing people on the Moon is just going to be exciting for itself. But when we first went to the Moon, we planted an American flag. Are we bringing one this time? Are we bringing a flag?  Adam Naids: We're definitely bringing a flag, Gary, and our team has been asked to start working on that flag. So, yeah, talk about responsibility. That one is super exciting, just as a symbol for what we're doing and what we stand for, and so it's really an honor to be getting to work or getting to work on that project right now.  Host: An honor indeed. Gentlemen, what an honor to be talking to you today about all of this. This is such an exciting time we're on, and I'm looking forward to being part of a generation that's going to see that next generation of moonwalkers and science on the Moon.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 168, “Expedition 1.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. Twenty years ago, on November 2nd, 2000, a crew of three spacefarers arrived at the International Space Station with a mission to bring the new orbital complex to life. We call these missions Expeditions, and the crew was Expedition 1. The trio was NASA's William Shepherd commander of Expedition 1, and Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev and Yuri Gidzenko. Both seasoned veterans of long duration missions aboard the Russian Space Station Mir that was in orbit. These three spent 136 days aboard the space station and set the course for what would be an unbroken streak of human presence in space. We like to tout often that if you're, I guess, at this point, younger than 20, you've never lived in a world where there haven't been humans in space at any given point in your life. To get to that point where humans started inhabiting the space station was not an easy thing. So, to tell the full story of Expedition 1, we have William Shepherd, goes by Shep. He was a manager of the space station program, a seasoned veteran in space, and the commander of Expedition 1 to the station. We talk about what it took to get to Expedition 1, the mission itself, and how the space station has grown into what it is today. So, here we go. Expedition 1 with Bill Shepherd. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Shep, thanks for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today. Appreciate your time.  Bill Shepherd: Yeah, happy to be with you, all my friends at NASA there.  Host: And I wanted to start with this, we're taking a snapshot here. Look where we are 20 years past when you first arrived on the International Space Station and set the course for continuous human presence. What are your initial thoughts right off the bat of achieving this milestone?  Bill Shepherd: Well, I'm kind of amazed that between NASA and all the international partners that we -- frankly, that we've got it done. Many, many people at the outset of the International Space Station Program decided it was mission impossible, and it was never going to happen, but the team has proved them wrong.  Host: Well, that's perfect. Well, let's take a deep dive then. I feel like you're the perfect person to talk to about this, just diving into exactly that. What were those obstacles that made it seem like mission impossible? So, let's start with the landscape of NASA and the international partnerships in the early '90s, when we were just kind of getting the International Space Station Program and the thought of what would be the International Space Station up and running.  Bill Shepherd: Well, the idea for a space station is not at all new. Certainly, even before World War II, people were talking about humans traveling in space and what we would do there. You know, I think von Braun had many sketches. There are Walt Disney shows on rockets going to space stations, but really it got off the ground, if you will, both in the U.S. and in the Soviet Union with manned laboratories. We had Skylab, and then the Russians had a number of Salyut space stations and then eventually one that they called Mir. President Reagan started Space Station Freedom, and this was in the early -- in the middle of '80s. And by 1992, the administrations had changed, and the problem was that NASA had spent almost $11 billion on Space Station Freedom, and it taken eight years. And not one pound of flight hardware was to show for it. And so, Congress was really upset with the space agency and was getting ready to cancel the program. And so, really ISS, the International Space Station Program was a big change that pulled the iron out of the fire and reorganized things. And that's kind of the path that we started on 20 years ago, and that's where we are today.  Host: Well, let's talk about some of those original plans. You mentioned Space Station Freedom. There were a number of other space stations that were actually flying at that time, Mir included. Let's take a dive into the Shuttle program and the original plans for shuttle as a vehicle to construct things like space stations.  Bill Shepherd: Well, NASA Space shuttle was actually something that NASA was promoting even before the end of the Apollo missions. I think John Young was on the Moon talking about what a great thing a space shuttle would be and encouraging the politicians to support it. But one of the purposes of the shuttle was to be able to build large things in Earth orbit. So, besides carrying astronauts to space and doing experiments and EVAs and robotics and whatnot, one of the main reasons why we needed a space shuttle was so we could build big stuff in orbit. And it was kind of in competition with the Russians. We didn't know what the Russians were going to do. They eventually built their own space shuttle and flew it one time. But that was the landscape. And I think, you know, to me, there was a lot of celebration and ceremony around the retiring of the shuttles and the ones that got transported to the museums. But for me, that was a really sad series of days because this was the end of at least United States astronauts launching, flying into space, and coming back in a vehicle that had wings on it that could land like an airplane. And I still think that's a tremendous capability, and we've pretty much given that up.  Host: Yeah and think about what it accomplished. You know, even before the International Space Station launched its first element, we did have cooperation with this space station that you're talking about, Mir, the Russian space station, where we had an opportunity to work together with Russia doing the shuttle Mir program. And not only, you know, using the shuttle, but also understanding the operations, I guess, behind long-duration spaceflight on Mir.  Bill Shepherd: Absolutely, if you look back to even President Kennedy in the earliest days of our human spaceflight effort, talked about the political and diplomatic benefits of working with the Soviets on space. And Apollo/Soyuz in 1975, was a result of that. And it took us a while after that, another two decades, to really get close to the Russian Federation and work together on space station. But I think it's a very healthy thing for NASA and for the country to be doing.  Host: We'll talk about those years. I think around this time, you were the International Space Station Program manager. You had a lot of oversight into, you know, this cooperation, U.S. and Russia, to go from this idea of freedom, International Space Station -- or Space Station Freedom to this cooperative International Space Station. Can you talk about some of those years?  Bill Shepherd: Well, my original assignment from the NASA administrator was to be on a -- basically a study team that would look at what is the, what's the executability, if you will, the Freedom Program? And if it needed to look like something else, what would that be? And I had -- I was a member of about a 10-men team, and we studied that for about a month and made recommendations. This was all being driven by directives from the Clinton Administration to figure out what was NASA's future with the Freedom Program and what were they going to do? After the study was over, then I was the program manager, basically handling several changes to what NASA was doing. One was, we were bringing the Russian Federation into the International Space Station partnership, which is a big deal. The partnership had been formed about six years earlier by international agreements with the Canadian Space Agency, the European Space Agency, and the -- there were other involvements with -- there is some involvement with the Italian Aerospace Industry. But that group was already up and running, and was initially very opposed to bringing yet another partner in because, in part, this would diminish everybody's availability for astronauts and research time on space, electrical power, and, you know, all those things that you've got to do to have a collaborative Expedition or environment up in orbit. So, there was a lot of negativity among the established partners to bring the Russians in. The Russians themselves were very difficult to deal with. And not because they are or were bad people, but you have to look at space from a Russian standpoint. They launched the first satellite into space. They had the first man to fly in space. They had the first woman to fly in space. They did the first spacewalk. They were the first to look at the backside of the Moon. There're quite a number of technological firsts that the Russians claim. And they -- to their -- from their point of view, they looked at the United States, us Americans, as coming in behind their successes and trying to take some of the credit for it. And I think there's some merit to that. I mean, we certainly approached doing space from different directions, technically, but Russians are very proud. They've got a very strong legacy in the early days of humans in space. And I think initially, we did not -- the Americans in particular, we did not respect that or appreciate that maybe as strongly as we might have. And that was -- you know, getting that -- getting behind that -- passed that was a big deal. In addition, there's several other things that were happening. One was the budget for the space station, whatever it was going to be called at that time, was quite constrained. The design of Freedom had to be changed for a number of reasons. It was too expensive. The assembly of the components had a lot of risk in it that we wanted to take out. We had Russian components that we had to integrate. We had this partnership that we had to manage. And we had a complete restructuring of the Space Station Program on the U.S. side altogether. NASA had written four prime contracts to various companies in the United States to carry out Freedom. And this was in the process of being condensed to a single prime contract. Some of the contractors were not going to maintain the work contents that they had originally won in the previous contract. They were unhappy about that. And in addition, the Space Station Program was going to be headquartered at one particular place in the country. And there was a lot of arm wrestling about where and which center or entity was going to be in charge of that and it ended up being Houston. I was very happy about that because I was living in Houston. But these were some of the dynamics that were going on at the time. Very respected Japanese partner who was in a lot of these discussions of the initial International Space Station partnership came up to me one day, and he said, Shep, since 1990, early 1993, he said, “Shep, you guys are doing your six redesign of the space station. You're changing the contract around. You're chopping pieces of the hardware off. You're running short on money. And you're changing the contract all around, and you're moving the headquarters to Houston. I don't think you're going to make it.” And that was -- he was a pretty seasoned guy. And that was his expert opinion in the middle of 1993. And so, I didn't say anything to him. I didn't want to be disrespectful, but I thought to myself, I thought, you know, we've got a real legacy of how to do hard things at NASA. They've got a great team working on this and just standby. We're going to show you that this can get done.  Host: Shep, there seemed to be just insurmountable odds against actually making this thing work. So, how did you navigate through all of these obstacles? What -- how did you integrate with the international partners, with Russia to actually make the International Space Station become a thing?  Bill Shepherd: Well, I don't think it's a simple answer, and I think a lot of people own parts of that story. I do think that one of the things that was really important was I stepped down from being a program manager because I -- the program manager has a lot of responsibilities to do. A lot of the Congressional liaison kept the funding for the program headed in the right direction, handholding for a lot of higher-level forums. And I wanted to do the -- more focused on the technical work. So, I was like what -- took on the role as a deputy program manager to do that. But that said, we started having pretty aggressive exchanges, groups of people in Moscow, talking to our Russian counterparts and having Russians in Houston. And I think that was really the thing that made the International Space Station Program go. The Russians came and certainly did things differently than what we did. But in the end, the design and how it was implemented added a lot of capability to the station. And I'm probably jumping ahead, we can talk about this later in the podcast, but nobody at the time realized that how important having multiple countries and multiple launch assets that could support the station in orbit. And after we've had, particularly the Columbia disaster, we would not have a space station if the Russians were not able to fly crews and material up to the ISS. And I don't think we specifically foresaw that in 1993. But the fact that many countries, the Europeans, the Japanese, and the Russians, in particular, could have an opportunity to launch to the station on their own, that was a big part of our design. So, the station has, even as a program, that had a lot of moving parts. It's hard to cover it all. In a short discussion.  Host: Well, we can zoom in on hardware because I think one of the things you mentioned with some of the early years is, we were doing a lot of studies on designing what would be a space station but never had any hardware to show for it. So, during the space station, there were that -- there was that development process of the initial hardware of the International Space Station. I know there's components like Mir-2 and Soyuz, and I know Zarya was a joint effort. How about some of those early space station hardware designs and processes?  Bill Shepherd: But I think you have to back up one step and think about, is there a culture or a philosophy that says not only what you design, but why you design it the way you do. And that was really the most interesting thing to me. Our previous Freedom design was dependent on some early assembly flights, where we didn't have a lot of cooling, communications, electric power, other capability. And gradually the station got built out, and those utilities, if you will, became more robust. But several of the aspects of this support to keep the station alive, had, if you will, a lot of technical risks that they were going to survive the period before we had redundancy. The Russians, on the other hand, designed smaller modules. They were, in essence, all up vehicles, and when they launched it. It had life support. It had environmental control. It had fire suppression. It had computers. It had radios. It had solar power. It had thermal control, had docking mechanisms, all that stuff. So, the analogy would be to having a house that you're building in the United States or the U.S. side of the partnership. We lay the foundation, and we get the studs in and frame everything out, put the roof on, and months into the construction, you might have a place you can roll out a cot and sleep. And the Russian approach was clear the driveway, and pull the Winnebago up and, you know, open the door. And those are two really different approaches to doing, you know, human-capable facilities in orbit. And I think there's a lot of merit to the Russian approach, frankly.  Host: Yeah, it's maybe a bit simpler. So, I guess around this time, you talked about stepping down from ISS program manager. At what point did you start gearing up for training for what would be the first Expedition?  Bill Shepherd: Summer of 1996. The first crew -- it was determined by the program management talking to the space agencies in the various countries that, at that time, this is summer of '96, the launch was supposed to be 1998, somewhere. And everybody was assuming that the training was going to be a year and a half or so, maybe a little bit longer. And that was historical reference from what it would take to train shuttle crews and what the Russians normally would do for their Soyuz training. So, mid-1986, it was decided that naming a crew to go to the station would basically start driving the training folks to get their training, mature and, you know, get started with crew training. So, we got named, trying to think when it was. I believe it was sometime in the fall of 1996, and we had started our training, essentially that winter. And it turned out that due to delays in hardware and launch schedules, the crew did not end up flying until almost the end of 2000. So, our training flow was about four years, plus a little bit, about twice what we had originally intended. It was very tedious. If you're training but you don't know when you're going to fly, it's somewhat akin to crawling over broken glass once in a while. But we all understood that this was a developmental thing, and nothing was going to be perfect. And if I can say, patience had to be somewhat of a virtue.  Host: I did have the pleasure of having Kathy Bolt on this podcast to talk about training and how it's evolved over time. And she did mention training the Expedition 1 crew, and one of the things she mentioned -- when you talked about it being tedious, one of the things she mentioned was there was this idea to train you to the system level, to train you to know that the whole International Space Station inside and out, how to switch all the buttons and how everything worked. And that training evolved over time to a more general approach, since the space station, for the most part, could be controlled from the ground. Did you know -- did you find that some of those -- some of that tedious training was just knowing like every system on the space station inside and out?  Bill Shepherd: Well, I want to commend Kathy and all the people who worked on Expedition 1 in particular. They did a great job training us. But I think the reality of it was, we were not the easiest crew to train, and that was true for a couple of reasons. One was, particularly Sergei Krikalev, who was an Energia engineer, and he was basically our flight engineer onboard. Both he and I had been intimately involved in Mir-2, and all the nuts and bolts of the U.S. side of the ISS program. So, we knew a lot about the hardware. And so, the other thing was, we knew when we flew that, although the ideal case was that the ground could do everything, the reality was that they were not going to be able to. Because particularly early in our flight, we only had direct communications, line of sight, from orbit to the ground, and we had to have a ground station relay all the comm to Houston or Moscow. So, this meant that our coverage was not going to be anything like what we have now on ISS or what we were used to on a space shuttle with the TDRSS relay satellite. So, we had periods -- we were going to have periods on orbit, sometimes four to six hours long, where we weren't talking anybody and nobody on the ground could see what was happening on ISS. So, with that in mind, you got to step back and say, well, am I going to wait for the ground to tell me what to do when something big is up? Or am I going to figure out what I have to do in the interim and try and, you know, prevent it from getting worse or fix it or make it better? So, we were pretty hard over that the right way for us to train as the first crew and probably the early crews up there was to know as much as we could about everything. Because the chances were good that in a big crunch up there, we were going to be on our own. That's why we did it.  Host: Very, very critical thing to be able to do for sure. I want to take a step back and zoom in on the fact that this is the first expedition, which means you are going to be up in space for much longer than some of your previous shuttle missions. So, Expedition 1 was 136 days. What -- let's take a step back to your shuttle missions and talk about what they were like and then how that compared to Expedition 1. You -- I have three listed for you STS-27, 41, and 52. Your experiences on those?  Bill Shepherd: Well, they're all different flights, 27 and 41 were pretty short, up and down flights. Twenty-Seven was a high inclination Department of Defense mission. The idea was to launch, swing the orbit around to a 57-degree inclination -- yeah, 57 degrees. And then as soon as we're ready, put an object out into orbit and check it out and come back home. So, it was a great mission. But almost by the time you were really accustomed to where to look to see the ground and what the food was going to be like you were getting ready to land and come home. Sort of the same thing on STS-41. Our big mission there was a planetary probe built by the Europeans called Ulysses. That was a launch. Ulysses was a pretty interesting object that carried inertial upper stages and went to a trajectory that sent it over the back of Jupiter. And they did that to give it an adjustment to its orbital inclination where it would fly down in the, if you will, of the southern hemisphere of the solar system and fly over the South Pole of the sun. But again, short mission up and down in a couple of days. STS-52, well, launch day, a laser reflector satellite but did about a week and a half of materials experiments, but that was pretty much it. So, in contrast, my two Russian crewmates, Sergei in particular, had spent a year in orbit on the Mir. He was the Soviet cosmonaut who launched and came down a year later without a country because, in the meantime, the Soviet Union had gone away, and the Russian Federation had been set up. So -- and Yuri had experience on the Mir as well. So, my position as a low time flyer was not something that the Russians were particularly happy with.  Host: Well, then let's talk about Expedition 1 then. Let's zoom in on the training there. I think what's one of the major differences is the vehicle that's going to take you to and from orbit. All of your previous flights were on the space shuttle. Now you were getting ready to learn everything about the Russian Soyuz.  Bill Shepherd: So, the Russians have had the Soyuz spacecraft since the mid-60s. And they had a legacy of training quite a number of foreign cosmonauts or astronauts from different countries as guests to ride on the Soyuz. So, the mode of their training was that the Americans that showed up to work on the space station were trained as -- or they were started on a training flow that basically saw them as guest cosmonauts. And we had a big problem with that because we said, look, we're going to be up there. We're not going to be in contact with the ground all the time. We're going to have a limited number of crew, and we've got to know not only what happens when this button doesn't work, but maybe why something is impeding it, or what's behind the panel, or what's going on that this thing needs to know or do to make it work. And this is not really how Russians trained their cosmonauts. But we said, hey, this is a new ballgame, and this is the way we want to do it. And after many, many battles with the training staff and the program managers, we made that happen. And so, you know, the big thing about training in Russia and for the Soyuz in particular was all the Russian training was in Russian. We had lesson plans that were translated to English. We initially started down the road saying, OK, we can sit there and with an interpreter looking at the translated script for the training, we can get what we need to get, but soon became obvious that we would need to be really proficient in Russian. So, everybody from the U.S. side that was training for ISS in Russia learned Russian. And it has some other benefit, and the big one was many of the people who were in the training flow as instructors had had some involvement in the Russian space program that went back ten, 20, 30 years, there were people there who had worked on Sputnik and who had trained Yuri Gagarin. And so, these people were walking encyclopedias for how the Russians did things. And I thought, you know, I could talk to these people with interpreters, but I really want to know what they're thinking about and why they're doing something a certain way. I have to be able to talk to them in Russian. So, that's what we did. And it was not an easy part of the training, but it was necessary. And I think, in hindsight, I think everybody is really glad that we were able to do that because it gave us the necessary insight into how this other space entity works and thinks.  Host: And it's very interesting because all the astronauts I talked to today, right before their launches, and I'm talking in the past couple years, they always talk about, you know, Russian training, we're still doing it. A lot of them say it is one of the harder parts about training, a lot of them with technical backgrounds able to understand that a little bit easier than maybe the Russian language but still a very valuable part of what it is to be an expedition astronaut, even today.  Bill Shepherd: One of the things that came out of that, before we leave the language issue was it made me think of how would I approach this if I was Japanese or if I was an Italian or, you know, the many other countries that want to be involved with helping to crew the station. And I'm going, you know, for somebody who doesn't have English or Russian as a first language, it's doubly hard. And I'm going, there's got to be a way that we can bridge that with controls and displays and training material and diagrams that explain, if you will, what the crew has to deal with in such a way that the need for complete textual understanding of what you're doing is reduced. And so, we created a graphic environment that's used on the ground, used in training, used on the displays on the space station. Today, it's really part of how the station is operated. And it was designed at the time to be somewhat universal. So, people ask me -- once in a while, they say, “hey, Shep, well, 100 years from now, what do you think people will remember about the International Space Station?” I say, well, if we're really lucky, they will remember having heard the name but not much else about it. But I think one thing that will endure is this approach to having multinational crews who have to travel in space and do pretty complex things. This kind of human interface is something that I think we started that I think it's going to last for a long time.  Host: Very cool. I want to jump over to your Expedition and talk about the journey there. Because now we're here 20 years later from when you were getting ready to launch. Talk about your experience, I guess, after training in Baikonur, preparing for launch.  Bill Shepherd: Well, I would say it's not too different than what the U.S. and American astronauts do between Houston, the Cape, and the shuttle launches. You go down to Baikonur about three weeks before your launch for a practice countdown. And then about five days before you fly, you show up again. You have final checks in the vehicle. The capsule gets made into the booster rocket; that goes out to the pad. And then the launch countdown starts, and morning of October 31st, we get up early, early in the morning, get a bite to eat, jump in the bus go down to the assembly area where we get in our spacesuits and get those checked out. Take the bus out to the pad and get on the rocket. So, that whole process was -- I wouldn't say it's familiar, but the sequence and the steps involved were very understandable to the Americans there. I'd say the only difference really was the Russians had set the launch date and the liftoff time about four months in advance -- three or four months in advance. And that did not change, so we got out. Baikonur is out kind of on the high desert, very flat terrain, almost no vegetation. This was the middle of the fall. You get up early in the morning, and it's kind of misty and foggy. And then the fog kind of lifts a little bit. But at 10:30 in the morning, there was still about a 200-foot ceiling, which means you go 200 feet up, and you're up in the clouds. Nobody can see what's going on. The Russians pushed the button, lit the fuse, we launched, boom, up into the clouds away we went. The shuttle never would have flown in those conditions. And so, you know, that -- I think that says a lot about the differences in how the two space cultures operate.  Host: Now, how about that ride in the Soyuz? That was your first launch on a Soyuz vehicle. How did that compare to shuttle?  Bill Shepherd: Yeah, nothing really bad to say about it. I think there's a lot of goodness in the vehicle and the capsule itself. Their abort regimes, where you can stop doing what you're doing and get to a safe place, they're really pretty good. The rocket itself -- I think, when we flew the Soyuz, which is also called the booster rocket, the Soyuz launcher had been to the pad that we flew on. And they had 461 successful launches without a failure, or at least a failure that would threaten the crew. And those are pretty good numbers, and so despite the fact that the inside of the vehicle is extremely cramped, the couches are quite uncomfortable, the suits are a pain in the butt, [inaudible], you know, absolutely. But you got to ask yourself, do you want comfort? Or do you want robustness and reliability? And I think for most people, that's an easy choice.  Host: That's right. Now it was a longer journey, I guess, compared to what we're seeing nowadays with a six-hour rendezvous. You were you were orbiting the Earth for two days before actually rendezvousing with the International Space Station, and finally getting ready to enter. Can you describe that journey?  Bill Shepherd: Yeah, that was historically how the Russians planned their launch dynamics, if you will. We were launching in the plane of the station, but well behind it and below it in every route that we go around. Because we're circling the Earth somewhat faster. We're gradually catching up, and when we get within striking distance the last day, we do a little burn, zip up to the station, and dock. I think that was a consequence of the ability of the Russians to have really good knowledge of where the Soyuz vehicle was and where the target vehicle was and what the potential errors could be. And so, driving around in orbit to do docking burns up a fair amount of fuel. You only have so much, so I think they were initially very conservative about how they plan their flights. Up until about maybe six, eight years ago, that was the way they did it. But then they started doing rapid rendezvous within four to six hours to catch up. It's just a little different flight. It takes more precision, but somehow the Russians were able to change that.  Host: Now when you actually docked to the International Space Station, this was going to be the first, I guess, long-term crew. You had STS-88 before that -- the International Space Station. But what were some of those things you had to do to get the space station ready for continuous human habitation?  Bill Shepherd: Well, the docking was automatic. It was controlled by Mission Control Moscow. I'm sure that people have seen the video tapes of the downlink and all that. We drive into a docking cone. And once we get the hooks of the probe in the right spot in the cone, a couple of switches get flipped, and the two rings of the spacecraft get mated together and sealed. So, we open the hatch. We check the pressure. Everything's good, open the hatch. One of my first jobs was to sample the composition of the atmosphere, make sure nothing toxic was in there. Yuri and Sergei were running around with checklists. There was stuff that they had to do, but I guess the biggest panic, if you will, that we had on our first day docked was we had a live press event that was scheduled for about three or -- at the end of our day, but three or four hours after we had docked. And it required getting a television camera out, getting some lights, wiring everything up, turning everything on, assembling in the service module, looking at the camera, and then doing a live downlink to Moscow. And we could not find the cord that we needed to hook the camera up to the port where it was going to be on the radio system. Just frantic for about an hour looking for the dang thing, we finally got it.  Host: Very cool.  Bill Shepherd: But that was pressure.  Host: Well, you know, you talked about going through the hatch and getting everything prepared. But what was going through my mind is, is actually entering through the hatch. Now, I know today, we see crews being welcomed by crew members that are already onboard station, since we do have a continuous presence. But you being the first ones onboard to start this continuous presence, did you do anything special, any sort of ceremony, any words, even just between each other to really recognize that moment of entering the station for the first time?  Bill Shepherd: Not really. We did task -- we were on the phone with Mr. Koptev, who was the head of the Russian Space Agency and Mr. Goldin, who was then NASA administrator. They were both in mission control in Moscow. And each Russian crew that flew on this space station had their own call sign. And it was generally one that stayed with various astronauts -- cosmonauts rather, during their career. So, one astronaut would -- they're usually astronomical names, you know, like Mars or Mercury or something like that. And Yuri Gidzenko, who was the commander, if you will, for the Soyuz capsule, his Russian call sign was Uran. And one of the choices was going to be that during the mission, our Expedition was going to be referred to as Uran. And Yuri would be Uran-1. And Sergei would be Uran-2, and I was probably going to be Uran-3. And I did not like that for a couple reasons. So, we kind of jumped the gun and asked if we could use the radio call sign Alpha, Space Station Alpha. And the ground was kind of apoplectic, but they said, OK, for -- as a radio call sign, we'll call you that. And there was a little bit of hubbub about that, and I think that finally went away six or eight missions later, but people don't realize that not all words, in English, translate well into Russian. And the same thing is true of the Russian words to English, and Uran is the name of the planet Uranus. And so, I saw that as probably a public relations minefield that we didn't want to go in.  Host: Well, let's talk about the -- you're the first Expedition. So, I keep relating to the space station, as I know it today, we're in a period of utilization. The mission is research. But I'm sure in the early years, your mission was getting the station ready for research and getting it -- there's assembly efforts, especially in the beginning years. And of course, you had to activate the space station and get it ready for future crews. Can you talk about some of your mission objectives in your multi-month stay?  Bill Shepherd: Yeah, it was exactly that. We had initial work to get the oxygen generation system. But the bigger tissue was the carbon dioxide removal system. That had some hiccups getting started. We had a number of systems that did not power up correctly. Some of them had components that were inoperable, or one in particular had a multipin connector and some of the pins were bent. But the work that we had for Expedition 1 was troubleshooting all that and inserting tab A into slot B, if you will, and we were all very hands-on guys. And that's what we thought we were going to be doing up on orbit. We were very happy to be in orbit doing all that because that's what we trained for. So, that was a really rewarding part of the first -- certainly the first half of our Expedition. And I got to say one thing about that. We were told at least three times that I can remember where we had come in that a particular piece of hardware was not functional, or something was broken or wasn't working the way it was supposed to. And we would say, “OK, fine, what's the grounds plan to fix this?” And the capcom would say, “OK, space station, we'll get back to you on that.” And about a day later, we get to read from the ground, and they would say, “well, we've got that, we've got the plan to fix whatever that thing is that's broken.” And we said, “OK, great. What is it?” And they said, “well, we're sending up spares.” I said, we said, “great, OK, when are they going to get here?” The answer was six months after you guys leave, and we said, woah. So, in all those cases that I can remember, after a couple days, we would have a discussion with Moscow or Houston, and the discussion would be, “hey, we see that console or that component, it's up and running now. Can you give us any words on what's going on?” And we would say, “look, now we spent the last three days tearing that thing apart at night and trying to figure out why it wouldn't work and fixing it.” And the ground would say, “well, where did you get the procedure to do that? Or where did you get the spare parts? Or where did you get the tools? Or, you know, who told you, you could do that?” And we said, “hey, well, we figured we couldn't make it any worse. So, we tried to fix it, and we did. And we could break it, again, if you guys want to break it?” And the ground, say, “no, no, just keep it running, keep it running.” And the thing about that was, was we were constantly going back and forth with the ground on essentially what the capability of the crew was. And it kind of got down to try not to be too restrictive. You know, let us do some thinking about what we can and can't do. Try not to get ahead of us on this. And I really think that's probably not something they do a lot of today on station because it's so mature. But when we go back to the Moon, guaranteed, astronauts are going to be doing an awful lot of that. And the question is, how do we learn where and how to be able to do that without making things worse? And that's one of the big questions for the future. We've got to have people who have that mindset.  Host: Yeah, that mindset of autonomy. I know it's definitely talked about, not only for the Moon, which I'm sure it will be implemented, but for Mars, whenever. Just like you had experienced on Expedition 1 where you had several hours of communication gaps, there's going to be significant communication delays for a Mars mission. And so, that level of autonomy and the crew being able to solve problems real time without the help of the of the ground is absolutely something to consider.  Bill Shepherd: Yeah, I think if there's one comment that I would have, I have not seen enough of that thinking, if you will, on how NASA is planning to go back to the Moon. I think maybe you don't need it for the Moon, for the outset to do lunar exploration, but we certainly need to be good at it when we start talking about going to Mars. And practicing that on a Moon mission is the way to go.  Host: Zooming back to Expedition 1 for just a second. You talked about some of your mission objectives, but I'm curious about life. You know, as I mentioned before the station as I know it today, very big, lots of space, lots of food, lots of things to do, exercise equipment, and they've been doing it for 20 years. So, it's very much routine. But what was lifelike for the first long duration crew aboard this spacecraft?  Bill Shepherd: Well, it had a routine to it, which we liked. Initially, we were really constrained because we could only get in the service module. But gradually, as we were able to add more power and open the node up, and we got the lab brought onboard, it got to be really expensive. And life got pretty good because, you know, we had a routine. We marched through the day, and things were really good. I've got to say that one of the things that -- couple things really surprised me though. One was, I was in the middle of the service module. We got the node opened up. We were running around doing some things, middle of the day, late morning. And I'm gliding over the viewport in the service module, which is facing Nadir, looking down to the Earth. And we're going over the mouth of the Mediterranean Straits of Gibraltar, and this is the third time maybe that morning that we had been in that neck of the Earth since we woke up. And I looked over to Yuri who was over by the galley where all the food is. And I said, Yuri, “do we have any more coffee over there?” And he was rifling through the coffee packs to see what was there. And I thought about, and I said, you know, I'm looking at the most fantastic view probably anybody ever has at this moment on the planet. And all I can think about is, you know, is there another cup of coffee in the galley? And it struck me that how normal being in this really abnormal situation had become, and I go, wow, this is really surprising. And I saw that a lot on our flight, and I've seen many crews after us in their on-orbit discussions and their debrief say exactly the same thing. It's incredible how adaptive humans are and how quickly these completely bizarre circumstances become routine.  Host: No, I hear that all the time. Just how this life onboard becomes routine. And just, you know, this view, you see it because you're circling the Earth 16 times a day. So, it does become a very regular thing still, you know, amazing to think about from here on the ground, especially for those of us who have not had that view but just an appreciation for the ability to adapt, as you're saying. You know, the station now, as I said, you just -- not only get used to it, but you have -- you have so many amenities, I guess, on the station, now. You have you have your own place to sleep. You have a sort of a dinner table where everybody can get together and eat off of the same dinner table. What was -- what were some of those elements of life on station with only three modules? You know, where were you sleeping? Where were you -- where were you eating together? It didn't seem like you had a lot of room to spare.  Bill Shepherd: Well, Sergei and I were in the service module sleep quarters, little rooms in the back end of the service module. Yuri had -- Yuri, he chose to bunk out first in the Soyuz. He slept on his Soyuz couch, which was kind of his command chair. When you're in zero gravity, as long as you're not banging into stuff, it really doesn't matter where you sleep because your body position is just kind of this slightly contracted relaxed position. And both Sergei and I had these little sleeping bags, you kind of zip yourself up in it so you're not banging around but quite comfortable. Yuri had a seat belt. He'd put that on and away we went. We did not have a kitchen table, and this was a big issue with the ground because we thought, we were told, we had trained, and we had thought we'd come up, and we'd find a kitchen table in a bag or a box or something. We talked to the ground after we -- about a couple days after we got on orbit, we said, hey, TsUP, the Russian center, we said, “where's our kitchen table?” They said, “well, we left that off the flight because we had stowage and weight problems, and we'll send it up to you.” And we said, “OK, fine. When's it going to show up?” Again, it was, “yeah, six months after you guys get there.” So, for about three weeks, we had a stealth project, and we took parts off of, if you will, shipping containers that came up in the Progress cargo ship. They were these aluminum racks and bars, and we built our own kitchen table out of scrap. And again, the ground went nuts, but it turned out to be a very workable arrangement. Second Expedition used it and liked it a lot. And I thought, actually, from a design standpoint, because it was a little bit smaller than the big kitchen table that was originally designed, that it was a little more workable. It wasn't in a way as much, but that got de-manifested when the big table came up. And I think that that piece of hardware is in a museum somewhere. But again, it's a question of letting the crews to kind of adapt to their own space, to build on that a little bit more. Every crew I've seen on station, they get to the point where they see themselves in an environment that's really not part of the Earth anymore, at least for, you know, a couple months. And that's a really important kind of mental construct as to how astronauts see themselves in relation to Earth.  Host: Now, you mentioned you -- when you were talking to the ground, you said, “that's not going to come for another six months.” Was that the arrival of the 102 crew, the space shuttle that arrived? And what else did they bring?  Bill Shepherd: Well, actually, the table came after the 102 crew. So, I think the six months might -- the table showing up might have been the -- at the end of their Expedition. But 102 brought up the [Multipurpose Logistics Module] MPLM, the Italian logistics module that the Italian Space Agency was providing. And that was also Susan Helms, Jim Voss, and Commander Yuri Usachev, and we spent the week with them on orbit. People outside hooking stuff up, and then Jim and Susan, I guess, did a spacewalk or two, I guess. And then when we do these docked events with a shuttle because of the reduced pressure that the shuttle has to be at for the EVAs, we generally have the hatches closed. So, it's the shuttle docks, you have some initial meet and greet, then it's a couple days of hatches closed. And we open the hatches up when the EVAs are done. So, you know, very hectic time, a lot of running around moving bags and cargo, get any the MPLM attached to the station. But it was great to see all these people that we had worked and trained with for years, and now they're up on orbit, and we're going to get on Discovery, close the hatch and go home.  Host: Now, one thing before you went home that I believe it was you who instituted this was, it's a tradition that's still carried on today, handing over command of the International Space Station. You as the first commander, that change of command ceremony with a bell and handing over of I think it was a key that was started by you. And that was inspired by your time in the Navy. Is that right?  Bill Shepherd: Yes. And it was something that we had talked about, both with the Russian cosmonauts and the other astronauts in Houston, that we wanted to do. Simply because we had two control centers at that point. We have four now, at least. I think we might have five, I'm not sure. But the -- who was in charge of the space station in later years in the modern era definitely gets passed around from country to country and even, you know, nationality or nationality as far the station commander. So, anticipating that we thought, you know, the Navy has a long tradition of doing this, and it's the Royal Navy in the UK, the Russian Navy does it, the U.S. Navy does it. Then you have this little ceremony where you say, OK, fine, here's the crew, and we're going to tell you something, and here's the new guy who's in charge. And this is what he's going to do, and so it's a change of command. And we thought that was a really important cultural thing to introduce to the space station. I think at first the Russians were going -- they're scratching their head saying, you know, what are these Americans doing now? But I think today, they and the Canadians, the Japanese and the Europeans really like it because it really sets the tone for the next phase of station operations and how it's going to be run.  Host: Now, when you came home, you came home on the space shuttle. And this was a little bit different for you in that -- the time you spent in space was much longer than you had previously on your other shuttle missions. How were you feeling when you came back now that you had spent so much time in your space, your body adjusting to 1 g after a long Expedition?  Bill Shepherd: I had a really good experience. I don't really know why. I know we spent a lot of time on our days on orbit getting what exercise we could. We had a little jungle gym that we worked on. It was new. That really seemed to be beneficial. My experience coming back after the ISS flight was probably as good as my shorter shuttle flights. And I felt really good. I did not have any particular uneasiness, you know, neurovestibular issues or anything like that. As a little experiment, the day after we got back, the morning after the day we had landed, we were going to pile into a van out of the parking lot at the Kennedy Space Center, and we're going to go somewhere for some kind of test. And when you're walking around to do these things, you have a flight surgeon right with you and maybe one or two other handlers just in case you start going wobbly, you know, they'll catch you. And I felt pretty good, and so, we're out in the parking lot. I talked to my flight doc, and I said, now, Terry -- and he was going to drive the van. I said, “Terry, let me try driving the van.” And Terry, he's holding his hand on his head. It's Sunday morning. And it's like 6:00 o'clock in the lobby, in the lot outside the [Operations and Checkout] O&C building at KSC. There's nobody in the parking lot. There's no cars in the parking lot. And he says, OK, but just take it really -- so I got in the car, and I'm driving around really slowly, and I could turn really slowly. Didn't like braking abruptly, but, you know, as long as I was easy on the controls, it was OK. And I did that for about three or four minutes. I stopped, got out, and I thought to myself, this is the kind of thing that we're going to be doing. When we go to Mars, and we have a long journey, we're going to be weightless, we have a landing, we're all going to pile out, and we're going to be in rovers and things like that. And I thought about that, and I said to myself, we can do this.  Host: That's big. That's very big. That means that, you know, as we're shaping what that's going to look like, that little experiment you did in the parking lot might actually prove useful as to how humans can perform on another surface. You know, we've learned so--  Bill Shepherd: Like, it's not well documented, but I think that's the kind of stuff we'll be looking.  Host: [Laughter] That's right. You know, we learned so much just from the International Space Station just past yours. I know you retired from NASA in 2001 but taking a look at the whole Space Station Program after your mission going from -- starting in 2000. Now, here we are 2020. You know, what do you take away from the experience of what you've seen maybe from the outside of what we have -- or what value the International Space Station throughout these past 20 years has brought us?  Bill Shepherd: I think people maybe have not experienced or don't remember what a technical and programmatic and possibly just diplomatic challenge the space station really was. And the fact that we're able to do it, I don't think the space station's had a major technical casualty that I'm aware of, since we launched. We've had, what, 63 Expeditions on there that have all been very successful. We have multiple ways to get to the station now. So, you got to step back and say, well, what does this really mean, in terms of the future? What, you know, what does it say about what's next? And I say, well, if we're going to go past the Moon, out to Mars, and maybe other places, asteroids and things like that, the character of how we will do this, it's going to have several aspects. One is the vehicles that we send, and they're probably going to be more than one of them, are going to be very big. They're going to be such a size that they can't be assembled on the ground and launched in a single lift. We don't have the boosters that are going to have enough power. So, they're going to have to be assembled in orbit with EVA and robotics. And they're going to have to combine the resources of more than just one country because the expanse of a Mars mission is not something any single country is going to be able to afford, nor would they have all the technology and capability that will be required. And so, if you look at International Space Station, it's really a blueprint for how to do this. And so, I think all those questions, they're behind us.  Host: That's just an incredible thing to think about, you know, the space station, not only for informing exploration plans. We're talking about the Moon. We're talking about Mars. And having a foundation of international cooperation is really, thanks to the space station program. I know one thing we're looking forward to in the near future, you talked about multiple ways to get to the space station now. That's an era of commercialization with commercial crew. And I know there's efforts to commercialize low-Earth orbit and thinking about what else is going to be in low-Earth orbit in the future, and it'll be thanks to the space station that's informing some of those commercial enterprises. Do you think there's value there to the space station as a platform to help build an economy in low-Earth orbit?  Bill Shepherd: Well, I think it's a big question that hinges on what do commercial operations really who -- or commercial enterprises, what do they look like? I think it's hard to have a commercial market when NASA's the only customer. It kind of stretches to the question of is it really a commercial event? If we were able to find some material, invent or develop something that could only be done in space that both had tremendous value, either in the space-based economy or back here on Earth, then I think you'd see commercial space really take off. Everybody's very optimistic that we are going to find something like that. I know that if we don't look for it, then we're not going to find it.  Host: That's right. Now thinking about that, you know, you got to make sure that NASA is not just the only customer, that we're one of many customers. And we're also looking at exploration. We got this Artemis Program, and that's going to inform our exploration plans for Mars. How do you see NASA's role for the future?  Bill Shepherd: Well, I think it's an open question right now. I would like to see NASA take a strong role in leading the technology development and organizing the architecture for how we're going to do lunar exploration and certainly Mars expeditions. I think that's the right place for NASA. The one negative comment that I would have is that we're -- NASA is a political animal, if you will. And we tend to have great periods of very robust development and operations and then a stand down for a decade or two before we do the next big thing. We did that in the Moon program. We did that in shuttle. We're probably going to do that when space station's past its peak and getting ready for some sort of disposition. I don't think it's a very healthy way to have a robust, space capable organization. If we could change that for the better, I think it'd be a tremendous thing.  Host: I absolutely believe that too. Bill Shepherd, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast and sharing the history of what it took to get to Expedition 1, your experience there, and then what you helped shape for 20 continuous years onboard the International Space Station. I very much appreciate your time.  Bill Shepherd: I'm happy to be with you and your audience. Thank you.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.

        description: "Gary Jordan: Houston, We Have a Podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, episode 20, Special Delivery. I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your cohost today, along with Matt Buffington, director of public affairs at NASA's Ames Research Center in California, and the host of NASA in Silicon Valley Podcast. Matt, what's up?  Matthew Buffington: Hey Gary, we're doing great, so glad we could team up on this. This is also concurrently episode 69 for the NASA in Silicon Valley Podcast. There's a ton of overlap between our listeners, so I'm really glad we were able to make this happen.  Gary Jordan: Yeah, me too. Today is a very special episode, because we're teaming up with NASA in Silicon Valley Podcast to talk about some of the things we can find in a cargo vehicle when it's shipped to space, which is perfect because SpaceX will be sending its Dragon Cargo Vehicle to the International Space Station here soon. So, who do we have from Ames, Matt?  Matthew Buffington: Over here we're bringing in Dennis Leveson-Gower. He's a project scientist here over at Ames, and has tons of experience working on cargo, working on payloads, and sending them on up to the space station. How about over there in Houston?  Gary Jordan: We'll have Shane Kimbrough. He's a NASA astronaut who recently spent about six months on the space station and landed earlier this year. We've actually had him on the podcast to talk about his landing experience back in episode three. But while he was up there, he had quite a few cargo vehicles visit the station. He had the SpaceX Dragon, Orbital ATK Cygnus, Japanese HTV, and the Russian Progress all within his six-month stay aboard the station. So, it's fair to say he knows what cargo on station is all about. He performed hundreds of experiments with the science that was delivered on some of those vehicles, and even got some fresh food, so I'm excited to ask him about that experience.  Matthew Buffington: Awesome. I'm really excited to get the different perspective on both the science, on the space station, so we can see the astronaut's point of view, and the people who actually design those experiments.  Gary Jordan: Yeah, this is going to be a good episode. So, with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with Shane Kimbrough and Dennis Leveson-Gower. Enjoy.  Okay, all right, it looks like we're all connected, ready to go. How about this, Houston We Have a Podcast and NASA Silicon Valley combined?  Matthew Buffington: Yeah, this is going to be sweet.  Gary Jordan: Sweet, I know, I'm pumped. And we're doing this remotely, so here in Houston, I'm in the studio with NASA astronaut and no stranger to Houston We Have a Podcast, Shane Kimbrough. Shane, thanks for being here.   Shane Kimbrough: Hey, great to be here.  Gary Jordan: Cool, and how about over at Ames, Matt, who do you have?  Matthew Buffington: I'm sitting over here with my buddy Dennis Leveson-Gower. We actually go way back from SpaceX 8, was it Dennis?  Dennis Leveson-Gower: That's right.  Matthew Buffington: I always remember it because it was the first time SpaceX had launched a rocket and landed it on a barge. And Dennis was nice enough as I drove him back and forth from his office to do press interviews and stuff.  Gary Jordan: Nice enough indeed.  Matthew Buffington: Exactly so, I always like to start our podcast with the question of, how did you get to NASA, how did you end up in Silicon Valley. I definitely want to hear about that from Shane as well, but let's start off with Dennis. So tell us about, how did you end up at NASA?  Dennis Leveson-Gower: I really ended up here by accident. I was set to be a professor, discover things, have graduate students. I did a Ph.D. in biochemistry. Then I went to Stanford for a post-doctoral fellow doing bone marrow transplantation, graft vs. host disease, immunology. And slowly over the years, I thought, I'm going to go to industry. I'm not going to do the academic track anymore. It was a slow evolution. So I was out there, had my resume posted on job sites and stuff, looking around. Just got an email saying, are you interested in a position at NASA Ames? And I'm like, this is spam. I don't know anything about rockets, I'm not an engineer. I'm a biologist.   So, talked to my wife. She's like, you have to apply, it's NASA. So I thought, all right, at least I can go and see the base and look around, because I saw it on the side of the highway, so I knew there was some NASA thing here. And yeah, it was when I talked to the hiring manager, she really convinced me this was a really cool opportunity. Got me into a different head space of not just doing basic research, but doing applied research, and working with a whole different cadre of engineers and operations and safety.   And I don't know, it just really appealed to me, so I took a chance and took the job.  Matthew Buffington: That's pretty awesome. I always say, when people think of NASA, they think of rockets and telescopes. Biology is a huge part of that. Speaking of that, sometimes we have humans up in space.  Gary Jordan: Excellent segue. All right, Shane, how about you? How did you become an astronaut?  Shane Kimbrough: I came -- there's several obviously avenues to be an astronaut. I came through the military. I was an Army officer, Apache pilot my whole Army career. I took a little detour toward the end of I would say my conventional Army career when I went to graduate school at Georgia Tech, and then I went to teach math at West Point for a few years.  And then from there, I was called to come work down at Johnson Space Center for a few years. I had applied to be an astronaut that year, didn't get selected. But the good news was, I was I guess somewhat in the highly qualified category, so the Army detachment down here asked me to come down here and work for a few years. And that was to really get ready for the 2002 astronaut selection. Guess what, that selection never happened. So, we went through the whole thing, interviews and everything, and it never happened. Congress decided they didn't need a class that year.  So, we hung around for another couple years, which in a way was somewhat rolling the dice on my Army career. But my wife and I felt it was where we wanted to be and what we wanted to do, so stuck around, and was lucky enough to get selected in 2004.  Gary Jordan: Lucky and persistent enough.  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, persistence is a big trait, I think. It was my fourth time to apply.  Matthew Buffington: I was going to say, isn't that normal for astronauts? Because we had Steve Smith a while back on our podcast, and I think he had applied three or four times as well.  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, I think at least it used to be the norm. A lot of times these days, at least in the last couple classes, we've had a lot of first-timers. But yeah, for folks a little older like myself, I think three or four times is pretty normal.  Gary Jordan: I remember talking with the 2017 class, and a couple of them applied multiple times. I know for sure Raja Chari did, but you're right, a couple of them are first-timers. But then you've got folks like Clay Anderson, who applied like, what, eight or nine times or something? So yeah, right.  Shane Kimbrough: Persistence.  Gary Jordan: Exactly, persistence, and it works out too. This is perfect, to combine forces for the podcast today -- Houston We Have a Podcast and NASA in Silicon Valley -- because today's topic is cargo, and cargo going to the International Space Station. And Shane, I feel like you're the perfect person to have on the podcast today, because you've seen your fair share of cargo vehicles on your last mission, right?  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, we saw everything, and we saw Cygnus twice. We had a lot of vehicles coming and going. And really cargo, when you think about it, it's the way we handle the logistics problem on the space station. It's a big logistics problem, if you think about it, to get equipment and clothes and food and experiments to that orbiting laboratory. So, how do we do that? We used to do it with the space shuttle. It was nice and easy, it could haul a bunch of stuff. Now, we can't do that, so we have these cargo vehicles you're talking about.  Gary Jordan: That's right, because on your way to the space station, you can bring stuff, but now you need stuff delivered. It's a huge complex. It's the size of a five-bedroom house, it needs stuff -- food, supplies, all that kind of things.  Matthew Buffington: That's one of the funny things as we were coming in, especially as we're getting closer for the SpaceX 13 launch coming into it. We see there's the both sides -- there's the people up at the space station working on receiving the cargo or even science experiments, but also on the flipside of, how do you get that stuff prepared? That is a feat in and of itself.  Gary Jordan: That's true. So Dennis, what do you have to do to prepare stuff to go on cargo missions?  Dennis Leveson-Gower: That's a big question, because I mean, it really starts one to two years ahead of the launch, if you think about it, or more, because after you have an experiment defined, you've got to prepare exactly what the science requirements are, then you've got to start making a plan, then you've got to start assessing what the hardware needs are, and the kits' needs are, then you have to design those, then they have to get through safety, you have to plan operations, you have to plan how everything's going to be labelled.  And then, usually I think somewhere between three and six months before a launch is when we're going to actually have things prepared, off-gassed, tested, H-fit, label committee, all those things, and do the early load. And then we start preparing the late load chemicals and perishables that have to be loaded 25 hours before launch. And we do that out at Kennedy Space Center for SpaceX launch, anyways.   So, there's a whole experiment development cycle that happens, and that's just for one payload. And if we have five or six payloads from Ames coming out, that's a lot of work from a lot of people to send a box of something.  Matthew Buffington: It takes a village for it, gathering all that stuff up. But I'm always curious on your guys' side, Shane, for you guys, when you receive this cargo, how exactly does that happen, or how does that work? Like, you're unpacking a trunk from a trip?  Shane Kimbrough: No, we're always excited to open up the hatch and get new stuff. It's kind of like Christmas every time we get one of these vehicles up there. But the way we go about unpacking is very organized, and it has to be that way. We have a great team on the ground that gets us ready and prepared with all kind of documents, and keeps us organized with charts and things on how they want it to be unpacked. And so, we follow that religiously.  We'll have somebody in the crew is going to be called the loadmaster, and that person's responsible for that vehicle. If we just start pulling things out and stowing things where we want to stow them, that's not the way it's going to be, because we'll never find that stuff. We really have to be disciplined, and put things where they're supposed to go. A lot of times, that means we'll take one bag out, and the bag will have 100 different items in it. And we have to go put those 100 things somewhere.  So, it's not as easy as pulling a bag out and stuffing it somewhere. Sometimes it is, but most of the time it's not. So, we've really got to make sure we're all helping each other out. And it's always better to, as I've found with all these cargo ops, to do it as a team versus doing it individually. You're much more efficient, and you can have one person reading the book, keeping control of everything, and the other couple people running things around. And that really worked well for us.  Gary Jordan: So, everything has an order and a destination, right? You've got to unload this first, and put it in this location, and it's all scheduled that way. How long does it take you to unload completely?  Shane Kimbrough: I think we actually set some records for unloading vehicles the quickest, which is a good thing I guess. But, we really -- and we did it by working together as a team. And that's the only way. Thomas [Pesquet] and Peggy [Whitson] and I would knock out a vehicle, no kidding, in a day and a half or two. But, that's pretty unusual. That was kind of if it happened to show up just before a weekend, we used the weekend to do it, so it was a freebie. Where if they had it just playing out during a normal week, it would take a week to two weeks sometimes depending on the vehicle to get it unloaded.  Gary Jordan: That's right, because you've got to fit it with everything else you're doing. Wow, amazing.  Matthew Buffington: Yeah, and a lot of that, I'd imagine it's already complicated enough, and I'm sure it's crazy complicated even just within NASA, but then you start throwing in all these private companies and different groups. Is everybody, how do you keep -- maybe you guys could talk about, how do you keep everybody on the same page on how things get prepared. Because Dennis, you're preparing this stuff for these companies, but then . . .  Dennis Leveson-Gower: I think they all go through NASA. You'll have private hardware developers, but the manifest is controlled through NASA, and the crew procedures are controlled through NASA. Shane, correct me if I'm wrong, but at some certain point has to be layered into the controlled process of NASA, even if it's like -- so, you could think of it as NASA buying things from different vendors, but they'll manage how it goes up, or they'll manage it through SpaceX how it goes up.  Shane Kimbrough: Totally agree. We saw differences, of course, because the vehicles are all different inside, so the way they, location coding is all different, and where things might be on one is different than another. That's the only difference, but bottom line is, you're going to get a bag, you're going to take it somewhere, you're going to take it apart, and take those things somewhere. And if we keep it pretty simple like that, it made it easier on the crew.  Gary Jordan: Definitely. You're the pro mover when it comes to cargo missions.  Shane Kimbrough: I'm going to get a reputation here.  Gary Jordan: So what are some of the main differences, then, in terms of, Dennis, on your end, for qualifications, and we can start with that -- what's the difference to get it on that vehicle? But then Shane, for unpacking it, some of those little tiny things?   Dennis Leveson-Gower: The biggest thing for us is always safety. We go to great lengths to try to have chemicals that will not interfere with the life support system, that won't be toxic to the crew if they're spilled. Everything that has a tox level will have certain levels of containers and containment that have to be layered onto how it's packaged and how it's stored.   Then, we have human factors. We have to make sure that the 5 percent Japanese female and the 5 percent American male can handle the things. And then, even right before it's loaded, there's an expert that comes in with gloves on and feels everything, to make sure there's no sharp edges on anything, and that it's not going to hurt anybody when they start pulling them out of the packages. That's what I've seen on my end, big picture.  Shane Kimbrough: I'd say from our end, it's very similar, like I mentioned before. But there are some things. Every vehicle that gets there, there's some critical items that need to come off first. And we're well aware of what those are, based on the ground team prepping us for that. And most of the time, those are delicate experiments or things like that that have to come off, or are time-sensitive. We'll obviously hit those first, and then after that we'll follow the script that the ground lays out for us, so that we're all on the same sheet of music, and everybody knows what's going on. Even if we're doing it in our spare time, where the ground control team might not be following, we can update them with, hey, we did sections two, three, and four, whatever it was, and they'll be caught back up with us when they get back on console.  Gary Jordan: Yeah, like if you're doing it on a weekend or something. Sweet. So, what's an example of time-critical, since you unpacked so many vehicles, what's an example of a time-critical experiment you had to unpack?  Shane Kimbrough: We had some rodents onboard, so that was one thing we had to get off. Those are always time-critical, just to get them setup in their habitations on the space station. That's one. I think some that just showed up today actually on the space station were things like pizza on ice cream. If you get things like that, those are time-critical, because you need to eat those quickly. Anyway, there's plenty of different, a wide range there I gave you from rodents to ice cream.  Matthew Buffington: And I have to chime in on that, because this isn't just the sad, dehydrated stuff you buy at the museum. This is a legit pizza.  Shane Kimbrough: This is the real deal, apparently. It's the first time I've heard of a pizza delivery going to the space station, so whatever company got that is going . . .  Matthew Buffington: 30 minutes or less.  Dennis Leveson-Gower: It's not going to be the best pizza, but it'll probably taste good to you guys.  Shane Kimbrough: Ice cream's legit, though. Of course, we didn't have any when I was there, but shortly after I left, they got some, and they're getting some today.  Gary Jordan: They waited until right after you left? Oh, man.  Shane Kimbrough: Apparently so.  Dennis Leveson-Gower: After SpaceX 8 launched, all the guys on the ground at KSC had all these Klondike bars filling the freezer. And I'm like, where did these come from? And they go, the CMC team, the cargo team, when they were packing all the cold stowage, if there's any empty areas in the freezers, they start stuffing ice cream bars in there, as a surprise for the crew. So, we have extra boxes of Klondike bars.  Shane Kimbrough: Always a welcome treat.  Matthew Buffington: But, when you're unpacking during this, are you in constant contact with the ground, and they're walking you through it, or it's just a mix of sometimes you are, sometimes you guys get your to-do list and you make it happen and update them later on?  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, we have a couple meetings beforehand, of course, before the vehicle gets there, and there's a whole choreography they want us to do, and the order they want us to do it in. And so, we're disciplined and follow that to the T. A lot of times we'd have questions, or something wouldn't be where it was supposed to be, and that's where we'd call down real quickly and touch base with whoever was on console for that, so that we weren't getting out of their choreography, even if something wasn't there. But they were always there if we needed them. Usually, we would just tag up at the end of a day, end of a cargo day, and make sure to tell them exactly what we did so they were up to speed on everything.  Gary Jordan: I don't know if you got any Klondike bars. Was there any missions that gave you some nice treats?  Shane Kimbrough: I think almost every vehicle had care packages from our families onboard. Those are always a surprise, so that was kind of cool. We didn't get any ice cream, but we got a lot of fresh fruit, and that was kind of cool. That's another thing I think they hold onto, and if there's any extra space they'll cram them in there. But, some apples and oranges and things like that were really delicious after not having them for quite a while.  Gary Jordan: I was going to say, definitely a treat compared to -- it's fresh, it's literally fresh.  Shane Kimbrough: We ate those really quickly.  Gary Jordan: You kind of have to.  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, don't want them to go bad.  Matthew Buffington: I'm wondering, as you get into the coordination that's needed, and even thinking on the side when, we have researchers, scientists who are creating science experiments, it's hard enough doing it in a lab on your own. And so, when people are -- I'm wondering, Dennis, from your perspective as people design and put these experiments together, but then Dennis -- or, Shane, on your side, actually conducting these things. Talk a little about that, what goes into making an experiment for someone else to do, and your instructions on how to do it? It seems very complicated. I'm looking at you, Dennis.  Dennis Leveson-Gower: Okay, what I'll receive is basically a grant proposal that had a very high science score from a panel of reviewers. And then I'll start looking at it and saying, can we actually do this in space? Because, crew time is very precious. You cannot do things as quickly in space as you can on the ground. We add a 1.4 margin of how long it would take us on earth, at a minimum. It's all got to be done in a self-contained glove box volume. And, I start working to make little tweaks and adjustments -- like I said, can we replace this chemical with a nontoxic one? Can we simplify this procedure? What's the tolerance of the timeline? Because, if they have to do an EVA, we can't have a time-critical part of our experiment at the same time they've got to be outside the station.  So, we start looking at every single factor, and it takes month to organize that. But then, eventually we get that down into a set of crew procedures, just like written, step-by-step, everything to do, and it should be simple as possible, even though these astronauts are super well trained and super smart. We make these super simple documents to send them. It's kind of funny. And then the training happens at JSC, where an experienced scientist will go and work with the astronauts, and make a fighter pilot into a biologist.  And then we send everything up. And then on my end, we're sitting in a control room watching a live video of the astronauts. It's very cool. And, talking to them. And usually, there's one designated person with the best speaking voice talking, and then there's five people in the room behind them with total chaos, yelling it's storage locker 5B, 6-Alpha, and they go, storage locker 5-6-B-Alpha. And then, we just are in their ear, pretty much, walking them through what we need them to do.  I know there's simpler payloads, where I think Shane would say you just follow written instruction, but for some of the more complicated things, we're actually talking to them, walking them through it.  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, it's very helpful to have Dennis and his team there talking to us. These scientists in general have spent many years creating whatever the experiment is. The last thing we want to do is mess it up, or mess up any of their data. So, we want to be very careful in all that whole process Dennis explained about getting the experiment approved and then what he's got to do to get it in a crew procedure. That takes a lot of people a lot of time. And so, by the time it gets to us, it's pretty well refined. It's not perfect, because I haven't seen that procedure, and I might read something differently than Dennis would read it. So, it is so nice to have them on the horn, so to speak, right there talking to us in case we have any questions, so we don't mess up any of the experiment or any of the data.  Gary Jordan: That's true. And then off of Dennis' point of making them as simple as possible, a lot of it has to do with the fact that, you're right, these scientists spend so much time getting these procedures ready for this experiment, but that's not the only one you're doing. You are doing quite a few experiments.  Shane Kimbrough: Very true, and in general, we're not trained on all these. We're trained generically on experiments. Like Dennis alluded to, making a pilot a biologist for a day. I was lucky enough to have Peggy there, who is a biologist, so she could help me understand something that normally I wouldn't understand, because it's not in my background. But Dennis and his team can get some really complicated experiment into a procedure that's simple, like he said, so that even I can understand it. That's pretty good.  Gary Jordan: So, what else do you have to train for, besides the scientific experiments? Because Dennis also talked about, you have to train for EVAs, and on this last mission you did four, so that's quite a big chunk of time that takes away for science. And then you've got to train for unloading cargo vehicles. What else are you training for?  Shane Kimbrough: Those are the big ones. Of course, the cargo vehicles when they come up, we actually use the robotic arm to grab them, to capture them. So, a lot of our training is with the robotics team to make sure we do that operation successfully. Grabbing something that's going 17,500 miles an hour is not trivial. But, with our training, we always train of course for the worst-case scenarios, and the vehicles, at least when I was there, behaved very well. It seemed like it was simple, even though the stress is pretty high, the gains are up, because it's a real vehicle and you want to make sure we grab this thing and get it onboard. So, that's another piece of our training we do.  What else? Those are the big-ticket items. Operationally, EVAs, like you talked about, robotics, when we're capturing these vehicles, and most of the other time we're doing experiments. That makes up most of our days onboard the space station.  Gary Jordan: Yeah. Was it different to use the robotic arm to capture the different vehicles, or did it translate pretty well?  Shane Kimbrough: There are differences certainly with every vehicle. So, we had Cygnus, we had SpaceX, we had HTV from Japan, and we had a Russian vehicle, but that one docks automatically, so we didn't have to reach out with the robotic arm to grab that one. But, there are several differences, and the cues you use are different for every vehicle. Again, we get spun up by our training team a week or two prior to each vehicle showing up, so we remember you're looking here, not here, based on whatever the vehicle was, and using certain cues to help get the vehicle onboard.  Matthew Buffington: I'd imagine no matter how much you train on that, and I'm sure there's simulations and different things of remoting the giant robotic arm, I imagine once you're doing that for the first time, it's got to be nerve-wracking, because you're like, this is a very expensive toy, I don't want to mess this up.  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, it was on the first time. And again, we got several opportunities, so I won't say it became less important, but you got more comfortable with it. But, it is a big deal. And I really wanted Tomas, the French astronaut I was flying with, to get a lot of experiment. So, when we were together, I grabbed the first one, and after that I let him grab all the other ones, to get his experience level up. And he'll go fly again here in a few years, hopefully, and be able to use all that experience to help his crewmates out when he's onboard.  Gary Jordan: Definitely. When you're training to capture these things, like Matt was saying, when you're in the real thing, it's a little bit different, but the training, I've seen it before. It's pretty detailed. There's a projection of, it's like a, I don't know, describe the training.  Shane Kimbrough: We have this, we call it a dome facility, because that's what it is, and the graphics are just fantastic. And it gives you the sense of speed in which things are coming together, and the rats that you're coming are very good. But, it's just not the real thing. It's like our pool. Our pool is amazing to train for space walks, but it's not the real thing. There are differences. And until you get up there -- and now, we're in the Cupola, we're flying almost all of these out of the Kupla, which maybe think about you're upside down flying it, so spatially you've got to get your head around where are the arms moving even though you're upside down, those kind of things. It's not super simple until you actually get up there and do it a few times, and then it becomes a little bit easier on the mind.  Gary Jordan: I can see why they would put you through the training for it, because there's a lot to think about, just being upside down, using the controls, controlling something from a Cupola, but then the arm's over here, I guess.  Shane Kimbrough: Right. So, it's not necessarily right out your window. It is in this case when you're in the Kupla, but you could fly it from the lab as well, and you wouldn't have any windows and you'd just be using cameras. That's what we used to do. That's what we did on my first flight. So, things have gotten a lot better in that regard.  Gary Jordan: I'm sure they write these procedures to be as easy as possible, so Dennis, what are some of the techniques you do whenever you're writing these scientific procedures for the astronauts to make it as easy as possible for them?  Dennis Leveson-Gower: Yeah, I mean, we try to boil it down to step-by-step, but also add in some rationale for why you're doing it a certain way, so they don't have to memorize the exact step, but they can know what the end goal is and why they're doing it, so they know I should make sure I keep this cold, or I should make sure I handle this gently. And then hopefully, that helps.   But I find that most of the time, it boils down to, we have the procedure, but then they say, tell me what to do next, and we're just talking to them.  Shane Kimbrough: Especially when we're in the glove box. We're immobile when we're in there. We can't move around and do things.  Dennis Leveson-Gower: Yeah, and how do you read something when you're doing that?  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, so it's very helpful to have you guys onboard.  Matthew Buffington: And for me, going back, one thing that occurred to me as you're dealing with some, if it's a sensitive science experiment or the precious pizza cargo, I wonder, when you're packing, obviously there's a little bit of Tetris, where you're trying to place things into the cargo to be very efficient. But it's also, launches are quite intense. So I'd imagine, Dennis, I'd imagine things have to be durable enough to survive such a crazy, extreme, launching, and then it's floating in space, and then the big robotic arm that Shane's operating is grabbing it.  But then also, on the flipside, Shane, I'd imagine for you, being a human experiencing that sensation as well. But what goes into keeping things safe and packed in?  Dennis Leveson-Gower: Yeah, for especially things like the rodent habitat, we strap it to a table and we vibrate the heck out of it. It goes through launch impact testing, it gets put through temperatures, it goes through pressurization, depressurization. Anything like that goes through rigorous testing to make sure it stands up to things. And then, it's usually packed in some foam, into a locker. Then, it's put on a scale so that you can find the center of gravity of that hardware, and also the weight and dimensions. And then from that, some eggheads do some math, and some robots load it into the capsule the right way so it's all balanced. I don't understand all that part.  But, we just make sure that we've tested everything, whatever. And I mean, it's pretty excessive. Whatever could possible go wrong, we test, worst-case, and then we treat it as gently as possible. And yeah, then wrap it up and ship it up.  Matthew Buffington: And how is that, Shane, from your perspective being the human inside said rocket, vibrating and going through those intense pressures?  Shane Kimbrough: On the Soyuz, which is what I just flew on, I was very surprised on the launch how smooth it was. I had an experience on the space shuttle before, and it was rocking and rolling and shaking around like you'd imagine, and you see in the movies. But the Soyuz was super smooth. We pulled about 3Gs going uphill, but the ride itself was very smooth. I was very impressed.  Matthew Buffington: So, not only designing the experiments and getting them up, but you'd mentioned before, Dennis, that it could take years in this process. I'd imagine there's several experiments and ideas that never get into Shane's hands. Or, great ideas that just, either it's funding or different things. It's a competitive process, and everybody wants their cool science experiment to go up.  Dennis Leveson-Gower: Yeah, no, we have a queue of investigators going out to 2022. We're trying to get them flown off as fast as possible, but we're limited by launch vehicles and crew time. Crew time is becoming less of a concern, because we're getting an extra crew member up there. But now it's launch vehicles, and you can only launch so many experiments at a time. But, there's a whole list of reserve experiments, of people that have put their heart and soul into something, and they just need 15 minutes of crew time, and they're just hoping their experiment can get done.  Matthew Buffington: This is stuff that's already up there?  Dennis Leveson-Gower: I think they have over 100 experiments at a time on the ISS.  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, I think we ended up doing 273, I was told, over the six months. But yeah, at any one time, there can be over 100 onboard, that's about right.  Dennis Leveson-Gower: And I remember someone saying, Peggy's going to get every one of those done. She's going to work through the backlog.  Matthew Buffington: Singlehandedly.  Shane Kimbrough: We took out all the task list and all the things that were backlogged, for sure. So, it was nice.  Dennis Leveson-Gower: Yeah, a lot of people over here appreciate it when you guys give up some of your free time and bang one of those experiments out.  Shane Kimbrough: Glad to do it.  Gary Jordan: That's true. What else, besides if you were to take the weekend to unpack a cargo vehicle, what else are you doing on the weekends?  Shane Kimbrough: Weekends, generally on Saturday mornings, it's spent cleaning. So, it's like your house, about once a week you need to probably do a little cleaning. So, we spend all Saturday morning vacuuming the whole station, wiping things down, and just getting everything back in shape after usually a busy week. And then, Saturday afternoons are generally off, and Sundays are generally off. So, I'm a big sports fan, so I was usually watching games, whether it was football or World Series or anything going on. Tomas got us into watching rugby. So, that was big in Europe at the time. So, we got to watch some of those matches. So, we do that as a crew sometimes, or sometimes individually you'd watch those things. And you certainly can catch up on emails or watch movies or call home or any of those things as well. Or, you can just look out the window, which was always spectacular, something you can't do here on earth. So, I tried to do that more often, because I can always talk to people or email people when I'm on earth, but I can't always look out the Kupla window for a rev around the earth in 90 minutes. That was pretty cool.  Matthew Buffington: I'm curious, how is that setup? You don't have a normal weekend like you would. It's not like you're commuting home and spending the weekend with your family. You're sitting there floating in space, so there's never really a day off. You're always on.  Shane Kimbrough: Correct. So I had to, when I was the commander, I made it clear to my crew that we were going to work from DBC to DBC, which is the morning conference with mission control all the way to the evening conference with mission control, but we weren't going to work outside of that. And there were a few exceptions on the weekends where we'd say, there's this one cargo vehicle, for example, we want to unload. Let's do two hours, and that's it. We're going to work two hours together. If you've got three people, that equates to about six hours of work. And we can do a lot in two hours.  But I would make sure we weren't working all weekend, because as the commander, I've got to make sure the crew is not exhausted, for one, so they can hit the next week's activities when Monday starts. But also, we've got to always be ready for that really bad day, an emergency onboard the space station, where that's in the middle of the night or during the day. The crew's got to be fresh enough to handle that. So, I'm always thinking about that as I'm working the crew and the crew's being worked by the ground. And sometimes, we have to modify what they want us to do in order to keep our reserves, so to speak, to be able to handle an emergency.  Gary Jordan: That's right. So, as a commander, how much jurisdiction do you have on time, because I know they schedule a lot of things for you, but then what power do you have as a commander?  Shane Kimbrough: Big picture, we'll talk. I'll talk with the lead flight director usually before the week, or maybe even two weeks out. We'll talk about the big picture, how things are going to flow, and what they want to get done. And then, the details just kind of flush out. I don't really have too much influence on that. I'll let the flight director know, here's what I want to focus on. Make sure we get maybe a day here or there because we worked last weekend, and those kind of things, because that happens a lot.  And then in general, if something's coming up real-time, day-of, maybe an experiment or something is running twice as long as it was expected -- that happens. And we'll just adjust real-time. Maybe I'll take the activity that Peggy was supposed to do next, if she's buried in this experiment, or vice versa. We'll help each other out to get all the things done. And you do that almost daily. You get done with something early, you go help somebody else if you can, or else you take something else off their timeline by knocking out something down the road for them.  Gary Jordan: Sounds like you guys were really tightknit. You guts needed to be a really tight team to get all this stuff done.  Shane Kimbrough: Totally agree, and I was super fortunate to have Peggy and Tomas onboard for about 90 percent of my time onboard. I was with Kate [Rubins] and Takuya [Onishi] for only a week or so, unfortunately for me, because they were superstars as well. But, they left shortly after we got there. So really, my whole mission was with Peggy and Tomas on the US side. And we did really work well together. We thought the same, our work ethic was the same, and we just loved helping each other out and loved being around each other, which doesn't always happen. So, I was very fortunate.  Gary Jordan: Very true. That makes me -- getting back on track to the cargo stuff, I was actually thinking about, we were talking a lot about when cargo comes up, how to get it, how to unpack it, but then, there's a packing story, and they're different for each vehicle, because some of them just burn up, some of them have experiments running before they burn up, and then some of them actually come back. What are some of the differences there?  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, so we had all those. The only one that comes back to earth, as you're probably aware, is SpaceX. So, anything that's real critical experiment-wise, or even maybe broken equipment that engineers want to get their hands on to figure out what happened to it, those kind of things we'll put into SpaceX, so they can come back to the ground. A lot of that has to do with experiments we did on our bodies -- blood draws and those kind of things need to come back, as well as rodent research things will come back on SpaceX, because the scientists need to recover them and look at the data and get all that stuff.  That's one thing. All the other vehicles in general burn up, like you mentioned. So to me, I think of it, that's how we manage our trash. That's how we manage trash on the space station. We crate tons of trash, believe it or not, up there, whether it's food trash or clothes trash or experiment trash or waste, human waste. All that stuff needs to get off at some point. And the way we do that is to use these cargo vehicles that are not coming back to earth. And we can't just cram things in there, like you might think. It's a very organized way. And again, we'll get a plan from the ground team and mission control that lays out how they want us to pack it.  And a lot of times there are experiments onboard that will happen once it leaves the space station before it gets burned up, like you mentioned. So, we've got to make sure certain aisle ways are clear, and the airflow is going to be correct, so that those experiments can happen correctly.  Gary Jordan: I see. So, it's kind of like a supply chain, really, because there needs to be new stuff sent up to the International Space Station, and then you need to take some of the old stuff out. That's the cycle that keeps the ISS going.  Shane Kimbrough: Correct. And launch delays and things don't happen, and these launches aren't always happening on time. So, sometimes your trash backlog gets pretty high on the space station. That's not a -- there are some odors and things that go along with that. So, we always like to have vehicles coming frequently, so we can manage our trash, of course along with doing great experiments as well.  Gary Jordan: But you guys have plenty of food and all that kind of stuff, right? So, even if something gets delayed, you'll be set for a while, for at least a lot of things.  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah. I think they have about a six-month reserve onboard. So, we can handle a lot of delays, I guess.   Gary Jordan: Dennis, on your end, when it comes to these experiments coming back to earth, and especially on SpaceX, the ones you actually can get your hands on and don't burn up, what are some of the things you're looking at for those?  Dennis Leveson-Gower: Looking at getting it back as quickly as possible is usually our priority, especially with rodent experiments, cell science experiments. You're trying to study the effects of microgravity on these organisms, and the minute you start getting back into the earth's atmosphere, you're going to start to experience gravity and see molecular changes. So, the clock is ticking to try to get the samples back. So in the future, hopefully return vehicles can land on solid ground, and we get the samples back even faster.   Right now, it's taking about a day or two on a boat in the ocean. But yeah, the priority's obviously for animal experiments, we want all of them alive and happy. And so far, we've done it twice and they have been. JAXA has also done it twice. All the mice did really well on return. And, yeah, intact samples kept at the right stowage temperatures and everything, then we're happy.  Matthew Buffington: On a similar note, and this is a slight pivot, but I love the little catchphrase of working off the earth for the earth. We've talked a lot about how it all happens, from an idea, an experiment, it's created, it's packed, it's sent up, then you actually conduct it. But, I'd love to pick your brain, Dennis and also Shane, of the why. Why is doing experiments in microgravity important? Clearly NASA and the international community is spending a lot of money to put this thing up here. And, what can we get out of that that you just can't do on the ground?  Dennis Leveson-Gower: Yeah, there's a lot that we can't do on the ground. My bias is that we want to go to Mars, and we want to explore space, and we want to make Star Trek real, so we should be figuring out what happens to our bodies, what happens to physical processes on a cellular level, really understand the biology and what changes when the vector of gravity is removed.  Of course, there is objectives to benefit the earth, as you say, and one prime example is, you can't have forced bedrest of research animals, but if they're in space, all the gravity load is off, and it will mimic conditions where people have extended bedrest or unloading on their muscles.  You also, microgravity seems to have an accelerated aging effect, so you can look at age-related factors. You have fluid shifts, and basically high blood pressure in your brain, and that starts affecting the astronauts' vision and things like that, and we want to understand how that works.  So, you have a lot of, like, growing 3D tissues in the lab. To be able to do those kind of things, you may be able to do them better in space, and understand the processes better in space. And I think it directly translates into, benefits the earth. Sometimes, you have to connect the dots a little bit to see how that space research affects the ground, but if you look at every experiment we've done, it always has spin-off benefits.  Shane Kimbrough: Tough to add much to that. It's very true. The way I look at it is, everything we do up there is either for future exploration, like Dennis mentioned, or it's to help humanity in general. If we're not doing that, I think we're really missing the boat. But everything we touch up there and I've been involved with has met one of those two criteria.  One example I like to think of is, we have this machine up there that makes water. It takes every bit of liquid onboard the space station, from urine to sweat to condensation to anything, and it goes into this machine and it makes water that's extremely pure that we use for our food and our drinks the next day, so to speak. It's a great technology for us to have. It's not something we have to have for the space station, but we will have to have something like that for Mars, or the moon, or wherever we're going to go deep space. So, we're working on that now for future exploration.  A side benefit of this whole thing is, we actually use that technology on earth as well. There's third-world countries that don't have clean water supplies, and the same technology is helping them get clean water. That's really a cool thing when you're helping future exploration and you're helping humanity.  Gary Jordan: That's just one example, right? That's one thing on the station that's helping in both directions. Matt, I think that's a really good place to end the podcast.   Matthew Buffington: I think that's perfect, dude.  Gary Jordan: I think that's fantastic, because it kind of sums up why do we do all the science, and why the science goes up and down to the International Space Station. Guys, thanks so much for coming on the show, both to Shane and Dennis for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast and NASA in Silicon Valley, the first time we're doing this together. Matt, I really hope we can do this again.  Matthew Buffington: With our powers combined, it works out. Thanks a lot for helping pull this together. This has been a lot of fun.  Gary Jordan: Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, guys.  Shane Kimbrough: It was great, thanks everybody.   Dennis Leveson-Gower: Thanks for having me.  Matthew Buffington: Huge thanks to Dennis and Shane. Awesome.  [END]  Gary Jordan: Hey, thanks for sticking around. So today, we teamed up with the NASA in Silicon Valley Podcast to talk about cargo missions, and we had a couple different perspectives with Shane Kimbrough as an astronaut and also Dennis Leveson-Gower as a senior project scientist at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California. So if you want to want to check out all of NASA’s podcasts, just go to nasa.gov/podcasts. There’s where you can sign up for the NASA in Silicon Valley Podcast and subscribe to them, and there’s also a new one that just got released – last week I think at this point – called Gravity Assist and it’s hosted by Dr. Jim Green, NASA’s Director of Planetary Scientist. It’ll start with a 10-part series where he starts with the Sun and then goes all the way out to Pluto and makes his stops all along our solar system and then talks about planets beyond. This is going to be a really good podcast, so definitely stay tuned.  We were talking about cargo missions, so definitely tune in to the live coverage of the launch and capture of SpaceX CRS-13. I think SpaceX covers the launch, but you can find the latest times for the capture on nasa.gov/NTV, as in NASA TV, and you can see the latest schedule for when we’re going to be broadcasting that.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center Episode 28, Three Weeks in a Capsule.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  So this is the podcast.  We'll be bringing the experts.  NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to tell you the coolest information about what's going on here at NASA.  So today we're talking about what it will be like to live and work in the Orion Capsule with Jessica Vos.  She's a crew systems engineer here at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and we had a great discussion about how astronauts will operate in the Orion capsule for missions that can go up to three weeks.  Like how they'll eat, sleep, exercise, work, and if needed be prepared for the worst.  So with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with Ms. Jessica Vos.  Enjoy.     [ Music ]    Host: So living on Orion is going to be, it's going to be tough.  How long are the missions that you're going to be living, if you were to say you're going to live on Orion for blank, what are you planning for?  How long of a mission?    Jessica Vos: The longest that we're really thinking, it's designed to do four crew for 21 days.  The longest that we're really thinking, that will really work out, is probably in that like 15-, 16-day range.    Host: Huh.    Jessica Vos: Because once you start docking to DSG, you've facilities there, so you would just basically kind of shut down or close off the Orion and go use your habitat module.    Host: Okay.    Jessica Vos: The much bigger, spacious, better stuff, right.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: And this in thing, you're going to be on a transport vehicle when you're going that has some sort of a habitat kind of feature to it when you're going to Mars.    Host: Right.    Jessica Vos: So, the just Orion piece, probably the longest you'd really need to be living in there is, it's designed for 21 days.    Host: Okay.  And the 21 days takes into account in case something goes wrong and you need some extra time, or is it just the redundancy aspect of things?    Jessica Vos: Well it was more like the sizing.    Host: Sizing, okay.    Jessica Vos: You can try to squeeze a mission in that's right up to your 21 days and then you just have no margin for, you know, anything, but--    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: But the size of all of the consumables and how much, you know, CO2 scrubbing and how much water you need and stuff, it's for four crew for 21 days.    Host: Okay.  So then more likely it'll be like a 16-day thing. Cool.  So today let's talk about just Orion, living on it, and what that's going to look like.  You know, like you said, the 21-day mission profile, it can support someone for 21 days and what that's going to look like if you were to live there for, you know, up to that much but probably like you said, shorter, 16 days, so let's start with Orion, like what, what is it.  Because we talked with Najude and Morancy about this in a previous episode, but for those who didn't listen to it, let's talk about like what is Orion, what's the shape of it.  Like if you were living in it, what's this house look like.    Jessica Vos: Okay, so basically volume wise you're talking about maybe like a double minivan, you know.  So like if you take the size of a minivan, if you've ever been on a road trip, you try to squeeze four to six people in a minivan, it can be kind of tight, but if you double that volume, that's kind of what we're talking about.  It's about 300 cubic feet of space.  We are talking about putting four people in, and the shape is very similar to what you saw in the Apollo days in terms of that cone capsule, right.  Physics kind of dictates that in terms of when you're coming back from deep space, there's a lot of energy that needs to be released through the atmosphere, and particular blunt body shape does that really well.  So you've got, you know, the wide bottom with the skinnier top makes it look like a little cone.  So, very similar to that.    Host: Okay, cool.  But it sounds like, you said double minivan for four people, that's more space than I would think.    Jessica Vos: Yeah, and, you know, what's even better about it is the fact that you've got all of the volume to work with once you're in microgravity.    Host: That's right.    Jessica Vos: You don't just have the floor space.  You now have this really truly 3D space to do whatever you need to do in, so it's not just the four people in a double minivan in their seats and rocking around on the bottom of the car or being strapped in their seats, it's truly floating within that space, so.    Host: Okay.  So you got this double minivan sort of space, let's-- how about the lay of the land.  I'm imaging the one in building nine is the mockup of it.  Once you enter through that hatch, what are you looking at, like where are the seats, where are the screens, where is all that stuff?    Jessica Vos: Yeah, so we are fortunate enough to have a full-scale Orion mockup here in building nine at Johnson Space Center, and the space vehicle mockup facility it's like a big playground for spacecraft.  When we enter our mockup, you enter through the side hatch, and as you enter, you first step on a step.  And when you get in, you'll see there's a little bit of a space between your foot and the seat pan, the leg pan of the seats for the crew.  And there are four of those seats aligned two and two.  So two of them kind of, they don't stack like lay on top of each other like bunk beds, it's not like that.  But they're aligned two and two in like rows to your left.    Host: Okay.    Jessica Vos: If the crew were laying in their seats to see you as you come into the side hatch, they would need to turn their heads to the right.    Host: Okay.    Jessica Vos: So their feet--    Host: So the first, yeah, the first thing you see are their feet, and their heads are kind of towards the wall.    Jessica Vos: Right, yep.    Host: Okay.    Jessica Vos: So their legs are kind of oriented towards the center of the spacecraft, and their heads are toward the outside so that their heads can line up pretty much directly underneath the displays and controls as well as the windows.    Host: Oh.    Jessica Vos: So without moving their head a whole lot, they have visibility to look out the windows for orientation during, you know, dynamic phases of flight and understanding where they are relative to the stars, through the window, and then they also have all of the information that they need to execute those maneuvers on the displays and controls right in front of them.  It also is, a real interesting thing about that design of the seats, they don't have to do a whole lot of manipulation, like if you think about, oh, well why don't we do really super fancy touch screens.  Well, if you're in a vibration environment like during launch, your hands are really heavy actually, and your fingers are going to be moving around if you unstrap them from that seat and then try to go touch the screen.    Host: Right.    Jessica Vos: So they much prefer, of course, the switches and the dials and the buttons, which we have on the outer edges of our displays and controls.  We recently did some testing.  It was just, I think it was last year, about this time last year, where we did a legibility under vibration test with the crew, and so you had the whole system of the seat, the suit, and the human all vibrating under what we would determine, what we had determined to be our launch loading condition, the vibration condition, and then they have to tell us basically are they able to read the screen and execute what they're supposed to be doing based on those commands under the vibration condition.  So the whole point is that they're able to do what they need to be doing under all the dynamic phases of flight.  So the seat is, the design is for that purpose.    Host: All right.  Yeah, I'm imagining like a, I don't know if you've ever been like in the car or something, you see the clock like going up and down, like the digital clock, and it's really hard to read, and you're like what time is it.    Jessica Vos: And if you do need to reach and push the button next to the clock like can you, you know.  Are you going to push the right one.    Host: That's true, because when they're launched, you got all this weight on you.    Jessica Vos: So then after that you got the, you got the screens.  So then they have these buttons around the screens, right, that you can press?    Host: Yep.  So that's, and that's part of the design, right, three screens?    Jessica Vos: Yes, that is part of the design.  You've got two people monitoring those three screens, so you've got a little bit of that kind of ability for both people to operate both screens.  Now, I would say two screens at a time.  So that middle screen, you're going to get people being, reach and access wise, those two crew members, you know, copilot and pilot are going to be able to both see and touch at least those two screens in front of them, and then you kind of got the outer screens being monitored by one person at a time.    Host: Okay.    Jessica Vos: The switches are very important.  That's what gives them that tactile feedback of knowing that they actually done something while they're wearing, while they have their gloves on.  So it's easy for us, you know, with the fancy iPhones to just really gently feel a tap on the home screen button, right.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: But that's the same when you've got layers of a suit going around your hands, right.  So for them to know that they indeed have actuated something, they really like that switch feel.  And so there are specific designs around how those switches feel to the crew member to make sure that they know that they have in fact actuated what they were supposed to actuate.    Host: Yeah.  It's the space version of responsive design, where like, as if your phone, but a lot of other things to consider.    Jessica Vos: Yep.    Host: Awesome.  So that's like the, that's the pilot area, and that's where you would, you would, I guess, quote unquote fly Orion, right.  So then, so is the rest of the area that you're looking at, like you said when you go through the hatch, this whole area, is that the living area or is there more?    Jessica Vos: So there is space that's up back behind their heads.    Host: Okay.    Jessica Vos: And, now recall that the ECLS wall, ECLS is environmental control and life support, so there's like a wall back there that houses all of that equipment, and then in front of that is a bunch of stowage, a bunch of webbing kind of material.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: Like you know kind carabineer or hook to different D-rings in places to kind of stow stuff in and kind of keep it stowed back there.  Underneath the pallet, the floor, underneath the floor is more stowage.  That is also where some of the avionics bays are, I believe, and then some of the other systems for the vehicle that humans require such as the waste management system.    Host: Very important.    Jessica Vos: Very important.  So, yeah, somehow it all squeezes in there.    Host: Okay.  And that's really the, that's really what Orion is, is trying to, trying to get, you know, like this camper that you're going to be living in for 16, 21 days, whatever, and just squeeze all this stuff in that you need for all of that stuff, knowing that it's not like you can stop at a convenience store or gas station along the way to pick anything up.    Jessica Vos: Exactly.  In fact, as I speak to you this afternoon, there's a team of engineers at one of the off-site mockup facilities that are doing a stowage evaluation.  So they're literally right now playing that 3D game of Tetris and trying to figure out where all this mass and stuff is going to go.  Because you also have to think about the CG of the vehicle, both on launch and on landing, it's got to be very specific, so things have to be put in certain places.  And then there's also another very good consideration or important consideration, and that is, with respect to reach and access with the crew coming home and going through this dynamic phase of flight, there are certain things that you're going to want them to be able to get to pretty much right away.  So there's some stowage that is literally right on their seats.  There's stowage of things that's right next to them or such that one particular crew member can get there in a very quick amount of time.  So it's not like you can just put stuff wherever you want to.  There's also consideration, right, for not storing things like food next to things like the [inaudible].  So it gets tricky, and so they redo these evaluations as the designs for all of this equipment, crew equipment matures.    Host: All right.  Yeah, I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to get some tips from you for my dad because to, how to pack a camper for a camping trip, to make it the most efficient way possible.  He could definitely appreciate that because he's an expert packer, but not compared to an Orion crew system [inaudible].    Jessica Vos: Yeah, these guys have got it down, I'm telling you.    Host: Wow, all right.  So obviously, you know, you're maximizing the limited space that you have and thinking about every component about where things are stored and where things are, so, you know, the living portion of things, right.  What is, what's the lay of the land for, you know, now you can get out of your seat, and it's time to go do stuff.  Where is everything else?  Like food.    Jessica Vos: So there is a series of lockers both on that kind of ECLS wall that I was telling you about and a few more underneath the pallet on the floor, and I think portions of the food are stored in both of those places if I understand correctly.  It could be that all of it maybe went in one of lockers underneath the seats now that I'm thinking about it, but they need to, they're each stored-- the way that the food is going to be stored is very similar to what we see currently on the space station, which is that they're flown up in very specific sized compartments.  I think they call them CTBs, and they'll be organized either by crew member or by, you know, type of food that it is, and each of those gets put into a certain locker and given a certain, you know, spot to be.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: That's the same for a lot of the equipment actually.  It's just, it's all going to be in a particular locker.  There's a few different sizes of lockers and a few different kind of orientations, but it's all stowed away.  I think more interestingly there is the exercise device, and the exercise device is this neat little box that is going to be, going to serve as the step to the side hatch as well.  So in zero gravity, of course you don't need a step, right, to do anything with the side hatch.  You're not using the side hatch.  You really don't want that hatch to open on orbit.  But on landing, when the crew is somewhat deconditioned after having been in microgravity for 16 to 21 days, they might need a step to get up and over that edge.  So the idea is that this box that's taking up space serves two functions.  It's going to be the step to allow the crew to get in and out, and the recovery crew as well, and it's the exercise device.   And right now the exercise device is planned to be, it's kind of cool because it doesn't require any power.  It's just a flywheel-based device that's got some smart settings to it that allow the crew to execute different prescriptions that the ASCRs give them.  That's the astronaut strength and condition rehabilitation specialist I think.    Host: Got to have acronyms.    Jessica Vos: The ASCRs.  They provide the exercise prescriptions, and that one box alone will allow the crew members to get at least 30 minutes of exercise activity that will challenge their cardiovascular systems and their musculoskeletal systems as required, so--    Host: All right.    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: So a little tiny box, and it's kind of like a, I'm imagining a rowing machine, right, that you would see in the gym, kind of like that, but obviously more advanced so it can do aerobic and resistive exercise, meet all the needs that you need.    Jessica Vos: Right.    [00:19:52] Host: Because the space station right now has the advanced resistive exercise device--    Jessica Vos: Absolutely.    Host: Which is like a big weightlifting machine.  You don't have room for that.    Jessica Vos: No, we don't have room for that.  [laughter]    Host: And it's got a treadmill, I mean, from what Nujoud said, you could potentially stand up, right, if you were to like touch the base, like there's enough room where you can stand up straight?    Jessica Vos: Yes, yes.  You can.  I believe, I know I can, but I'm only five three.    Host: Oh, okay.    Jessica Vos: So I don't know that the, I believe the crew module is sized for I think up to a six four individual.    Host: Wow.    Jessica Vos: If I'm correct.    So, yeah, you don't have to be particularly short.  You will, you know, there is limits to which seat we can put you in if you are on that taller edge.    Host: Oh.    Jessica Vos: But, and I do believe that I think somebody at least up to six foot would be able to, like Nujoud said, stand in the center of the capsule.    Host: Wow.    Jessica Vos: But you're right, when you're rowing, you're still going to get into a standing stature position, but in zero gravity, we're going to have you do it through the center of the spacecraft.    Host: So you're not going up to the tip of the cone, right, you're going, yeah.    Jessica Vos: You're not going up, yeah, you're not going up to where the docking hatch is on the top at the very, at the tip, you're going to the other side of the spacecraft.  So you're starting at the side hatch, right underneath the side hatch, and you're extending your body long out to the other side of the spacecraft.    Host: Ah, okay.  So that's, so that takes up a decent amount of real estate, right, that's the, that's the working out real estate.    Jessica Vos: It sure does.    Host: And where is everyone else while someone is working out?  I guess they're all in the same room, right.    Jessica Vos: Yeah, they absolutely are.  And it's funny because when you think about how much time is really going to spent each day when you have four crew members doing at least 30 minutes each, it's like a couple hours that that person is going to be basically occupying a good chunk of the space while they exercise, and everyone else is going to have to be kind of staying out of the way, right.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: So it's going to be interesting.    Host: Plus the noise, I'm thinking of a rowing machine, right.  So plus the noise of rump, rump, for hours.    Jessica Vos: Oh yeah, absolutely.  That's a good topic actually.    Host: Really?    Jessica Vos: There are several acoustic requirements imposed on every system that goes into the cabin for just that reason.  Like it's very hard to concentrate and focus and get real work done, right, if you are constantly, you know, having to deal with a buzz.  You know how annoying that can be.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: So there are a lot of acoustic requirements placed on all of the different systems that have to be continuously operating, and yeah, the exercise device is one of them absolutely.    Host: So there's an acoustic, it has to be, it can't exceed like this noise level or something.    Jessica Vos: Yep.    Host: Interesting.    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: So have you simulated something, like an environment where people are living in Orion for a couple days already, or is that still to come, like so you can understand the acoustic environment and say, hey, that's annoying or something like that.    Jessica Vos: So there hasn't been, there has not been to my knowledge any day in the life of type of tests specific to the Orion capsule.  However, there have been a series of analogue tests being done in terms of the isolated environment.  So right here at Johnson Space Center, the human research program owns the HERA, which is the Human Exploration Research Analogue.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: And they do study how humans behave in isolation and the effects on team dynamics, and they try to stress them out a little bit, right, and try to see how they can improve on the team dynamics basically.  It's very BHP, behavioral health and performance oriented, not as much as hey, you know, is the Orion design adequate or sufficient.  We haven't gotten to that point with the Orion design yet in terms of verification and validation.  We will with EM1 and EM2.  We've got sensors on the EM1 mission that uses the Orion capsule that will measure acoustics and radiation and all that good stuff.  But in terms of the people aspect, we study it here through the human research program in HERA, and unfortunately the volume of that is just way beyond what-- it's huge in there.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: So they have way more volume in space to live and work in.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: The acoustics though I would say is probably one of the things that they do tweak to try to see if it stresses the crew out, but I couldn't speak to the results of that, but I'm sure that it's one of the things that they try to tweak, as a variable, to see what kind of impacts in terms of stress it has on the crew.    Host: Definitely, we actually just had Lisa Spence and Paul Haugen here earlier today to talk about HERA, and by the time this comes out, I believe there's the HERA episode already, Space Habitats.    Jessica Vos: Awesome.    Host: So there should already be a little bit more anybody that, and I was picking her brain, but obviously there's still, there's still researching.  They still have to collect the data--    Jessica Vos: Oh, yeah.    Host: So they haven't, they haven't like, you know, consolidated everything into a published paper quite yet, and more to come, but absolutely, totally transferrable to an Orion environment.  The human element to that.    Jessica Vos: Yep, yep.    Host: So, what other sorts of living systems are on, are on Orion.  I guess, well, okay, I'll lead in the right direction for, for example, environmental, right.  So to live you have to, you know, you're in space, but it's got to be a certain temperature, right?    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: You got to have oxygen and carbon dioxide removal and stuff like that.    Jessica Vos: Yeah, those humans are rather picky, right.  Like we take an exact just so much of a temperature swing or a pressure swing, and we just get uncomfortable really fast.  So, there's comfort and survival, right.    Host: Yeah, yeah.    Jessica Vos: So, Orion will be pressurized at 14.7 pounds per square inch, or PSI, which is exactly what you would see here in Houston, Texas, because we live pretty much at sea level.  So that's fantastic.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: We don't really have to deal with any sort of feelings or impacts to performance due to changes in pressure.    Host: Cool.    Jessica Vos: The air is also the exact same concentration of oxygen and nitrogen and all the rest of the trace contaminants, well we should be cleaner, honestly.  But, yeah, so we're looking at 21 percent oxygen and the rest nitrogen for the most part, so.    Host: All right.  So it's, okay, so it's emulating all of that, and all of this is in a tiny, is the environmental systems, do they have to be designed to be more compact, or was it kind of a cut and paste sort of technology?    Jessica Vos: Great question.  So I believe that what we are flying on Orion is a fairly new and more compact system.  It is a mean swing bed, it's a solid mean swing bed technology, which we have three units, and it's designed to be, as most systems are on this spacecraft, anything that's needed in different nominal missions, and nominal mission duration for four crew for 21 days, we try to design redundancy into, so that if something happens and you're just not quite sure what it was, okay, you know what, we're going to switch to this other thing instead, or we're just going to use the second one that we, you know, built into the system.  So that's how the ECLS system is.  We have three units, and each unit has two beds that swing.  So, what the purpose of the solid mean is to basically remove the CO2 from the air.  There's other kinds of filters within that system that'll take out other types of contaminants, but the main thing that we really worry about from a human health perspective and human performance perspective is that CO2. So, it'll take out the CO2.  It basically attaches, the solid mean is really sticky.  It likes the CO2, and then when we flip the bed and expose it to vacuum, all of it goes away.    Host: Wow.    Jessica Vos: Yeah, so once the bed is full, you turn around and expose it to vacuum, I think it's like 20 minutes or something max, and then you flip it around again, and we have three different units that do that same process.    Host: All right.    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: All right.  So, pretty efficient then, I would guess, right?  Because you're right, you built in the redundancy.    Jessica Vos: Yep.    Host: And talking with Nujoud before, that redundancy is built like, all right, we can have this amount, but if we go, if we do, you know, more redundant systems, then that's more weight, so what's the right amount, and then, boom, you locked in on the three, you said, right.    Jessica Vos: Yep.    Host: Yeah, very cool.    Jessica Vos: Yep, and like every single system has to have that trade of how much tolerance you're going to build into it.  Some systems we just say, you know what, we're going to have to, we can't afford it, we're going to have to fly in terms of mass.  We don't have the spare mass for this one versus this other more important one that we need the mass for, so we are going to decide to control it via operational controls in flight instead.  Just make sure that we only operate it for this much time or we only use it for this much, and you can, you know, there are, those are some of the other ways that you can manage the resources and the consumables that you don't have extra of, right.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: Power is like that quite a bit.  It's the same way on the space station right now.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: Like you have to know exactly what you're plugging into and how long you're plugging into it because you could short something else out over here, you know, so.    Host: So, I'm guessing Orion has power constraints too, right.    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: Is it going to be solar powered?    Jessica Vos: Yes.    Host: Okay.  Very cool.  So how is the solar panels now.  Because I've seen various pictures in the past of, you know, you got the ones that are more circular and ones that are more like an X.    Jessica Vos: We're the X.    Host: We're the X now.    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: Cool, I like that one.    Jessica Vos: Yeah, yeah, we are the X. We've got four.    Host: Sweet.    Jessica Vos: You know, that kind of do the pretty unfolding thing.    Host: All right.    Jessica Vos: So, yeah, but they go, they extend out fairly long, I don't know the exact numbers, but yeah.    Host: Okay, and that will, it'll be solar powered and--    Jessica Vos: Um-hum.    Host: Okay, very cool.  So another big one that I know about is, and you were talking about all of the important stuff being around, the waste management, right.    Jessica Vos: Um-hum.    Host: Right.  So you're going to be on there in the one room with four people for quite some time.    Jessica Vos: Yep.    Host: So how is the bathroom situation?    Jessica Vos: Tiny.  It is a very tiny, like smaller than a telephone booth like closet thing.    Host: All right.    Jessica Vos: It is very tiny, and it's really funny too because I believe as it's oriented right now, just because you only have so much room in the spacecraft, right, I think the exercise device sits right above the door for the WM.    Host: No.    Jessica Vos: So you may have to interrupt somebody's exercise session to go in and then, you know, interrupt it again to get out, so you know.  But, you know, that's what it's like when you're camping and living in a camper.  That's how things go.  So--    Host: It's true.    Jessica Vos: But, yeah, the design of the actual system itself, of the potty itself, is similar in, you know, concept to what we use on station today.    Host: Okay.    Jessica Vos: It's basically purposely driven airflow that's being intentionally directed in a certain way, you know, to help stuff get out and not get all over the place.    Host: Also very important.    Jessica Vos: Yes.  And then it gets contained into a canister that's got some odor control features to it, and then once that canister gets full, it can be sealed and closed off and then you stick a brand-new one in, and so--    Host: All right.    Jessica Vos: It's kind of a fancy bucket with a hose on the end of it and some odor-control features.    Host: Hey, that's going to come in handy, because that's right next to the exercise [inaudible].    Jessica Vos: Yes, I know.    Host: That whole area, I know I would hang out on the other side if I was at Orion for the most part for sure.    Jessica Vos: But, yeah, in general I'm not sure that there's a whole lot of privacy going to be offered on this vehicle.  I mean, of course there's always the option of hanging up your sleeping bag.  I mean you had a question about that, and it's really more of just a blanket with Velcro straps on it that allow you to adjust the squeezability, right, how tight it is on your body, and then some D-rings to adhere it to some pieces of structure so that you don't go floating off into each other when you're sleeping.  But there is the option of hanging that up, you know, putting the D-ring up, or getting it unfolded and sticking out so that you want to be behind it.  But I'm just, I can't imagine that with 21 days of taking that much time and energy to make sure that you get, you know, behind your little curtain, I don't know.    Host: Well, you know what, I would assume with a crew of four astronauts that are going on these missions, I would assume that they are going to be a very tight-knit group of people.    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: And just talking with space stations astronauts and even HERA, just talking with them too, whenever you're with people in these environments, you learn to, you know, teamwork is very important.  Camaraderie is very important, and all of that sort of translates into if you're going to the bathroom, respect each other, so--    Jessica Vos: Yeah.  Absolutely.    Host: Yeah.  Just out of curiosity, I’m thinking about the movie Apollo 13. So when they were on that trip, they didn’t have the water recycling system that we have on the International Space Station, they literally ejected it out into space. And it had this sort of cool crystal effect as it was floating away. Is that what’s going to happen on Orion?  Jessica Vos: It absolutely is.    Host: Ah that is so cool.  Jessica Vos: Yeah, I’m not sure that they’re going to be able to see it the same way. You know, just based on where the windows are and where that ejection port it, but – or the evacuation port I guess – but that’s how we’re going to do it.  Host: Ah, okay. I hope they get some good views – this kind of sounds weird to say – but it is kind of cool to see the crystallization of pee.  Jessica Vos: Yeah, so I’ve heard!  Host: Very cool.  There's a, you know, one thing I was thinking about actually is, we just moved right from flying the thing and like how, where everyone's going to be sitting to just kind of living, but I know there's going to be a launch and entry suit that you have to wear at first, right.  So these bulky like orange suits, right.  It's kind of like the, it's an upgraded, new, fancy pumpkin suit, right.    Jessica Vos: Right.    Host: Kind of.  So once you're wearing that and now you're in orbit and now you're transitioning to living on Orion, where does that pumpkin suit go?    Jessica Vos: So it has, it has another locker.    Host: A locker, okay, cool.    Jessica Vos: Yeah, just another locker, but that suit becomes really important in some of the, on orbit, in the event that some emergency happens like a depressed cabin, so if something happens that causes your cabin to depress for any reason, all of the systems in there including the food system and everything are meant to be, to provide for 144 hours of depressurized cabin survival.    Host: Oh, okay.    Jessica Vos: So 144 hours, basically six days.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: That's kind of like, yeah, worst case you're on the far side of the moon and something happens, your cabin depresses, and you have six days until you can get home.    Host: From the far side of the moon though, how long until you get home?    Jessica Vos: Six days.    Host: Oh, okay.  So it's literally planned for exactly that, in worst case scenario.    Jessica Vos: It's meant to cover that worst case scenario, absolutely.    Host: Got it, okay.    Jessica Vos: So, in that event, you're getting in your suit, and you're living in your suit.  So that suit also has some unique features to it that the pumpkin suits from the space shuttle program did not have.    Host: Oh, okay.    Jessica Vos: That would allow for, you know, the collection and mitigation of human waste.    Host: Wow.    Jessica Vos: Yeah, because that's six days' worth of living, right.    Host: Um-hum, yep.  It's also going to allow you to take in some calories and some water.    Host: Okay.    Jessica Vos: So there's special food bags and food-like consistent, what am I trying to say, like material, like it's going to be, and you wouldn't normal eat it, but if you had to, it's going to be like this, I don't want to say sludge, but it's kind of like a, it's like a powdery mixture that you would--    Host: It's not like the running gel, right?  Is it kind of like that?    Jessica Vos: It would be kind of like that.    Host: Okay.    Jessica Vos: Yeah, that would allow you to take in a lot of calories.    Host: Yeah, that's what those are for, right.    Jessica Vos: In a pouch, right.    Host: Yeah, yeah.    Jessica Vos: But it's specific to interfacing with the spacesuit and being operated with gloved hands and with a vacuum on the outside environment, right.  So it's a pretty tricky thing to--    Host: Is it like a straw that goes through the helmet or something and then you squeeze it through?    Jessica Vos: Basically that's what you would see.    Host: Oh, okay, yeah.    Jessica Vos: Yes, yeah.    Host: Oh, yeah, that's how I'm imagining.  I'm sure it's more complicated.    Jessica Vos: Right, right.  So there's a whole team of engineers that is working on putting that system together to make sure that the crew won't be starving for that 144 hours that they will.  But you can't pop the visor, you can't, you know, the whole, the whole interior of the spacecraft at that point is a vacuum.    Host: Right.    Jessica Vos: So--    Host: So you have to survive in the suit, and that suit has to support you for six days.    Jessica Vos: Yep.    Host: Whoa.    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: That's cool.  I actually think, is it, is it Cody Kelly?    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: Jessica Vos: Is that the guy?    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: Okay, yeah, I got his name about crew survival and stuff, so we're really going to have to bring him on the podcast.    Jessica Vos: Oh, absolutely.  That would be a-- he's a fun person, and he does all the fun stuff so--    Host: Awesome.  That would be cool.  Yeah, so the suits themselves are designed, but then, you know, they go into a tiny little locker, and then, you know, hands off for that.    Jessica Vos: In fact, the seats do as well.    Host: Oh, the seats go in lockers?    Jessica Vos: Yeah.  The whole cabin configuration just kind of changes from okay we're in flight mode to now were in just coast mode, right.    Host: Whoa.    Jessica Vos: And just live and do science experiments.    Host: Do the screens stay?    Jessica Vos: Yes.    Host: The screens stay, the chairs go, the suits go, and it opens up this whole thing.    Jessica Vos: Yep.    Host: Oh, that's so cool.  You know what, I did skip over, because you did briefly mention it, and then I just sort of skipped over it, but beds, you know, like sleeping.  It sounds like it's just going to be a sleeping bag strapped to a wall.    Jessica Vos: Right, yeah.  I was going to say, not so much with the bed.  There's no mattress, no, but there's also no gravity, so it's kind of cool, and this is, it's very similar to on space station.    Host: Right.    Jessica Vos: They find themselves rather comfortable once, you know, they adjust, that whole, you know, the way you feel when you first enter microgravity and the first couple of days can be a little, a little strange on the body.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: But you do get used to it fairly quickly.  It only takes a couple of days, but once you're there, it's really comfortable, and what they do is they have a blanket.  It's just thin though.  It's not like a big poufy sleeping bag or anything like that.  It's just thin because the temperature inside the cabin is, you know, that very comfortable kind of 72 to 75 degrees, and it's got various straps in places so that where you want to feel that snuggy feeling, right, you can, do it tight, but for the most part, they actually like to just kind of leave it a little bit loose, and you'll see them, they kind of sleep like zombies.    Host: Right.    Jessica Vos: Like they have their arms out in front of them, and they're just kind of hanging and they're floating, and it's funny because the station sleeping, quote unquote, sleeping bags are, they've got all of these straps and this and that to make sure your head doesn't go bobbling around and so you can hook yourself to the wall and you can get it super tight if you want.  And it just seems like none of that gets used.  Just floating there feels nice.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: You know, you can imagine, if you just kind of let your body just float in a pool.    Host: Oh, yeah, that's a good feeling, that's a good feeling.    Jessica Vos: You know, yeah.  So they're just like, all right, I'm going to sleep now.  Just lean back and let their arms float and--    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: You know, but they do, they do, I think, at least give themselves a little bit of a restraint so that they know they're not going to end up in somebody else's space overnight or into a different module entirely.    Host: That's true.  You don't want to play like space bumper cars in the middle of the night, just kind of slamming into each other.  That would be weird.  Yeah, just from talking to a couple astronauts, they both said, sleeping, you know, once you get used to it, sleeping in space is probably the best sleep you'll ever get.  Because, if you think about it, right, even in a bed here on Earth, you still have gravity pushing you against that bed.  In space you have--    Jessica Vos: And it's pushing that weight of the blanket on you too, which is so comforting.    Host: Oh, that is, that is comforting, yeah.  But just nothing pressing on you, that's got to be a fantastic feeling.    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: I bet you it should.    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: Just out of curiosity, for the way the mission is designed, for Orion missions, would it be kind of lights out, crew go to sleep, all at the same time, or are they going to be shifting?    Jessica Vos: As far as I understand it, there's not going to be much shifting.  They're going to be on a very similar, in terms of a day night schedule and sleep schedule, it'll be fairly similar.  What they will shift is their exercise sessions and their kind of personal time sessions, but from a day-night cycle, it would be the same.    Host: Okay.  Do they have the ability to sort of switch to like night mode and maybe turn the lights off or change them to like a warmer color?    Jessica Vos: Well, so that's interesting you ask that, because lighting is a big deal in terms of, you know, the habitability of an environment, right.    Host: Definitely.    Jessica Vos: You can have some really harsh lighting and just get headaches all the time, and you'd just be really like, grrr, and it's due to the lighting.  So I believe that the systems, there are requirements now for how we design habitable environments and what kind of lighting is required, and I know that they've implemented some interesting new blue light stuff up on space station.  So, I believe that that is one of the, going to be one of the capabilities with the lighting system in Orion, is to have different basically modes of light.  I don't know how fancy they're going to get, because it's not light we've got the Lexus of space crafts here, you know.  But that is something that is, in terms of helping them stick to a cycle, a day-night cycle, the whole circadian rhythms and all of that stuff, all of that science has been done, we know it works.  And so I believe that part of, at least some of that is going to be implemented in the lighting system in Orion.    Host: Yeah.  Because I know they are doing, it's called the lighting effect study on station, and it's exactly that.  LED lights, change them to a little warmer things in your crew quarters or something, so at night you don't have this big fluorescent light in your [inaudible].    Jessica Vos: Absolutely, yeah, they use them in HERA too.    Host: Oh, oh yeah they do.  That's right.    Jessica Vos: The whole bottom floor of the lab has a completely different set of lights than the habitation floors, both with the galley and the exercise equipment and stuff and then the sleeping tents, you know, on the very top floor of HERA, so--    Host: Yeah, just actually learning some of this stuff from HERA from this light effect study, I actually put like a blue light filter on my phone and on my computer like so at night I can, you know, I can browse a little bit without having to worry about it actually affecting my sleep.    Jessica Vos: Yep.    Host: Which after learning about it, I realized, oh my gosh, that's why I'm not sleeping, because I'm screens before bed.  You can't do it.    Jessica Vos: So in terms of speaking of screens, they will have laptops.    Host: Cool.    Jessica Vos: Anywhere between two and four.  There might be a couple laptops and a couple of iPads.  All of that is still to be determined, but it is currently accounted for in terms of the mass allotment for that kind of a system.    Host: All right.    Jessica Vos: And there's some dependencies there and some reasons why we would use that stuff.  One is to get rid of a bunch of paper, right.  You can do all of your procedures and stuff from your tablet.  They do that on station all the time now.  And another, especially from the crew health perspective is that that's how they would be able to do any sort of video conferencing, right, with home.  So I say that, at the same time, the way that EM2, the EM2 vehicle is currently equipped, it's only got the S band communication technology.    Host: So only radio, no visual.    Jessica Vos: Pretty much.  You might be able to squeeze a little bit in there, pictures but probably not real-time skype-like video.    Host: Yeah, yeah.    Jessica Vos: So, but there is some potential to expand Orion's capability with optical communication, and once they would do that, then for sure they'd be using these laptops to do more, you know, videoing with their families at home.  But they absolutely will have time each day or at least every other day or something along those lines to be communicating with their families.    Host: Nice.  All right.  So that's part of their day, right.  Actually that's a good conversation to have is we know that they are, you know, they're going to be working out.  We know that they're going to be sleeping.  What's a day on Orion like on this mission.  I guess, you know, talking with family, but, you know, is that built into the mission profile?    Jessica Vos: So we are flying people that are very good pilots for a reason.  Good pilots and good scientists, right.  Okay, well I guess it's pilots, scientists, and engineers.    Host: All right.    Jessica Vos: And the reason for that is because you need people, this EM2 mission is a mission that has not been done before.  Similar things have been done in Apollo, but that spacecraft was different, and the designs and how we got the mission done was a little bit different.  So this EM2 mission is really a checkout mission, and there's a lot of dynamic phases of flight.  A lot of, you know, translunar injection burns and stuff going on.  We're co-manifesting a payload on this mission, so there is a lot to, and it's just the first time that all of this stuff is going to be used in the manner that it was meant to be used by humans, right.  EM1 will test out a lot of the structure and the systems that are just automated and controlled from the ground, so that's good, but this is when the humans will kind of, you know, be doing the ringing out of all the different things that may or may not have been known about how this design is going to work.    Host: Yeah, yeah.    Jessica Vos: So they're going to be doing a lot of, you know, checking out, a lot of system checkout and kind of on purpose, you know, kind of driving certain systems to do certain things.  They're going to be piloting and navigating that spacecraft through all the different dynamic phases of flight.  They are going to be, there probably will be some science, but I don't expect that to come until like a little bit later missions, once we've really kind of flushed out what the system can handle and what it can't, because they need to be ready just in case something just isn't working the way it was planned to, designed to for whatever reason.    Host: Right.    Jessica Vos: They will spend a little bit of time doing their meal prep and meal time, and for the most part, that's kind of the only planned relaxation time, right.  They do have their personal time of personal hygiene, which usually is right after the exercise, right, but as a crew and being able to just relax, sit back, and, you know, I wouldn't say drink your coffee, but squeeze your coffee because it's in the same kind of like, it's like a Capri Sun for coffee, the same kind of thing, with a special straw in it that keeps it from leaking out when you're not actually sucking on it.  And so from that standpoint, there is meal prep time.  The food comes in lots of different kinds of packages that take different kinds of preparation, whether that's just heating or putting water in and letting it sit out and that kind of thing.  So they'll prep the food.  They'll prepare their coffee, and then they'll sit back and eat, and they'll do that two, three times a day.  So, yeah, I think that's pretty much the extent of what they're going to be doing on EM2.   And then once we start getting, hopefully we'll understand how these systems behave and how much maintenance they all really require and be able to move into doing more science, even on the shorter Orion missions and then extend that into what the deep space gateway would have with their habitation module and their labs and stuff.    Host: All right.  I can think of like a lot of different podcast episodes just on all of this, right.  Like we could probably do one just on EM2 so people understand what that's all about.  We could probably do one just on some concepts for deep space gateway.  Like there's a lot of like, because I can definitely ask a lot of questions, but we will be here for hours.    Jessica Vos: No, let's not do that.    Host: Yeah, yeah.    Jessica Vos: It's freezing in here.  [laughter]    Host: I'm so sorry.  I should have said to bring a jacket.  We did talk briefly with Nujoud about EM1 and just the structure of that mission real brief, right.  Another thing we need to do is actually cover EM1 through and through, but that's going to be no crew.  It's going to be going translunar injection, way out past the moon, coming back super-fast to test the heat shields.  And you're right, a lot of it is structural and just understanding about the space craft.    Jessica Vos: Yep.    Host: Do you think you can give like a two-minute explanation of EM2, or is that really something we should probably save for a podcast.    Jessica Vos: Well, for the two-minute explanation, we will be launching from Kennedy Space Center on top of the SLS, and there will be a comanifested payload along with this mission.  So not only is it the first manned mission of Orion, but we will also be bringing [inaudible] payload along with us.  And the AA2, I was trying to think about the launch abort, so there will be the LAS system on top of the Orion, so in terms of the rocket sack that you'll see, you'll see SLS.  You will see Orion, but Orion will be covered by the LAS shroud, the Launch Abort Systems shroud.  But the test of that system is actually coming up before EM1, so that will be really exciting to see.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: So, once we, after we launch and we get rid of the LAS, because we didn't need it, thank goodness, right, everybody was cool, we will be going around the orbit one time in kind of a low Earth orbit, and then we'll continue on into a high Earth orbit, at which point we'll kind of separate from the first stage and let that go, and the comanifested payload in Orion will go in different directions, both going to the moon, but in different orbit trajectories, orbital trajectories.    Host: Ah, okay.    Jessica Vos: So there will be two different stages of the rocket taking these two things in two different directions, and they'll do two different translunar injections, but at that point in the mission, the Orion and the service module are heading out to the moon as are the comanifested payload, or as is the comanifested payload.  When it is on a trajectory that's going to take several, several days to get into a different orbit, it's going to be a near rectilinear halo orbit that the comanifested payload will be going into, and we will be going into just a free return trajectory around the moon.    Host: Okay, all right.  And then--    Jessica Vos: And that is expected, from the Orion perspective, it takes about, yeah, about 10 to 12 days to do that mission.    Host: Okay, 10 to 12, and that's when we're getting to the Orion can last for 21 days, but this is more of a 10 to 12 sort of deal.    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: Okay.  So the comanifested payload, that stays there, right.  It doesn't come back?    Jessica Vos: It does not come back.    Host: But the people definitely do, right.    Jessica Vos: Yes, exactly.    Host: Yeah, cool.    Jessica Vos: But, yeah, the comanifested payload will be staying in that NRHO orbit around the moon, kind of that polar orbit, it looks that way.    Host: Yeah, uh-huh.    Jessica Vos: And, yeah, but we'll be coming, we'll be coming back.    Host: Cool.  All right.    Jessica Vos: So there's a whole suite of landing and recovery systems as well that allow us to retrieve the capsule once it lands and allows us to survive re-entry and then get to the capsule and recover it.    Host: Yeah, so landing and recovery, is that like a, what's included in that package?  Is that parachutes or am I--    Jessica Vos: Yeah, yeah.  Like everything that we need on that heat shield, the parachutes.  There's a system called the command module uprighting system that is, or the crew module uprighting system, excuse me, not the Apollo.  It is what will make sure that we are able to upright the vehicle should it land with its, you know, docking hatch side down in the water.  We don't want it, that's not the proper orientation, right, that would have the crew hanging in a funny position in their seats, so we want it to flip back over on it's own.  So those come out and inflate.  Those are those big orange, you know, balloon things that you see on the top of the capsule.    Host: Oh.    Jessica Vos: They used them in EFT1's.    Host: Yes, yes.  I know what you're talking about.  They're just, they look like big puffy life jackets sort of, I guess. Yeah, cool.    Jessica Vos: And there's a series of parachutes that go to that.  I think there's 11 total parachutes, when you think about all the droves and then the main, so, yeah that's a whole system in and of itself, just like the abort system protects you from anything that might go wrong on the pad.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: And then we also have a service module abort capability, which is, should anything go wrong, when you made it to orbit but now something happened that you're not able to complete the entire mission, but you don't have to lose the crew, you can just abort to an Earth orbit and then come back in, you know, intentionally, from that orbit instead of having gone all the way out to the moon and back.    Host: Ah.    Jessica Vos: So lots of orbit capability.  A lot of capability for keeping the crew alive.  In fact, you've got that launch abort capability.  You've got the system, sorry, service module abort capability.  You've got the 144-hour survival scenario.    Host: Right.    Jessica Vos: So when the crew is in their suits.    Host: Yes.    Jessica Vos: And then you also have, should you land just something off nominal, the cabin is required to provide the crew with a habitable environment for up to 24 hours.  So that would be a not very fun 24 hours.  I can tell you right now.  It's going to be, you're going to feel thick just from having gone through what you went through, let alone bobbing and rocking on the ocean. Depending on where you landed, that might be kind of a warm cabin, not a whole lot of cooling available for that time.  There is ventilation.  You open up what's called a snorkel fan, and you will get airflow, but, yeah, it's going to be, but the point is, is that they're not going to, they will be able to stay alive and be kept safe on the ocean for up to 24 hours.    Host: All right.  A lot of things to think about for a worst case scenario, but it seems like you got it, you got it like covered all along the way.  You got launch abort, you have crew survival within the suits, you got this whole waving in the ocean but still able to, you know, figure it out, even if the capsule lands upside-down, flipping it up like right side up, so.    Jessica Vos: Yeah, that is basically what human spaceflight is all about.  In order to bring back, you know, that experience that they have and to be able to use that knowledge and expertise during the mission, you got to keep them alive, and you got to keep them performing well.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: So, all of that goes into, you know, making sure that we, those are national assets at that point, right.  All of our astronauts that go and get all this knowledge.    Host: The human and the human space flight is definitely the most important [inaudible].  For sure.  Awesome.  Well, Jessica, thank you so much for coming on the podcast.  That was an awesome description of, I felt like I was there.  I felt like I was living in Orion.  I felt like I was slurping on those things through the suit.  I didn't want to, but I felt it.  But, yeah, no, that was really, that was really awesome.  We're definitely, and I thought of so many different more podcast episodes that we can do, just covering all of these different things, because this was just like a high level like, you know, even just, you know, going through the intricate details of living on Orion, there's still so much more to talk about, so definitely looking forward to another podcast.  Thanks so much for coming on.  Maybe one more time, we'll probably have to have you another time.    Jessica Vos: All right, thank you so much.    Host: Yeah, cool.     [ Music ]  Host:  Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So today we talked with Jessica Vos about living in Orion and kind of the space of how it's all laid out, and there's a lot more that we could have talked about with Orion as I mentioned at the end of the podcast.  If you want to know more right now and just can't wait for another episode of Houston We Have a Podcast, go to NASA.gov/Orion.  I would say there's definitely some cool stuff to come in Houston We Have a Podcast, but if you want to know right now, just go to that website.  Or on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, it's @NASAOrion, that's on Facebook.  Twitter is @NASA_Orion, and then on Instagram @exploreNASA is like Orion and space launch system all of that kind of combined.   If you have a question specifically about Orion, use the hashtag askNASA on any one of those platforms, and ask that question there, or you can submit and idea to the podcast.  Just make sure to mention it's for Houston We Have a Podcast.  This podcast was recorded on November 16, 2017.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, Rachel Kraft, and Laura Rochon.  And thanks again to Ms. Jessica Vos for coming on the show.  We'll be back next week.",

        description: "Dan Huot (Host):  Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center.  This is episode 43, diet like an astronaut.  I'm Dan Huot and I'll be your host today.  And on this podcast we bring in the experts.  NASA scientists.  Engineers.  Astronauts.  Anybody who can let you know about the coolest stuff going on right here at NASA.  Today we're talking about nutrition in space.  More specifically, what the astronauts have to eat to stay healthy and functional during long-duration space flight.  There's a lot of folks working on that right here at the NASA Johnson Space Center.  Including my guest Dr. Scott Smith, NASA nutritionist and the manager for nutritional biochemistry.  There's some pretty significant differences in the way astronauts have to eat in space versus the way we eat here on Earth.  And so we sat down to learn more about what the body needs to thrive in space.  And how we're preparing to tackle some big challenges for future long-duration missions into deep space.   So with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with Dr. Scott Smith.  Enjoy.     [ Music ]  All right, I'm here with Dr. Scott Smith.  Scott, you're the, can I call you Scott?    Scott Smith:  You can call me Scott.    Host:  Scott, just for the sake of keeping things easy.  So you're the manager, and this is a mouthful as so of our guests are, for nutritional biochemistry.  You're a NASA nutritionist.  Start me off.  What does that mean?  What does your job kind of encompass here?    Scott Smith:  Well, the nutrition biochemistry lab is responsible for, in essence, keeping crews healthy from a nutrition point of view.  So we are not the food lab.  I'm always very quick to point out we don't make the Tang.  I don't have anything to do with the food.  Our job is to understand what the body needs.  And we provide data to the food lab that crew members need this many calories and this much protein.  Or this much carbohydrate.  Or this much vitamin A. Or vitamin E. Or vitamin D. Or iron.  Copper.  Sodium.  Zinc.  You name it.  So we're really the nutrient end of things.  And we do work with the crews to make sure they're eating well.  And then we try to study the body during flight.  In ground analogs to try to understand how we can modify nutrition to help keep crews healthier during space flight.    Host:  And it kind of amazes me that you go so in depth, you know.  You're not, the astronauts aren't just counting calories.  You're counting everything for them.  And, I mean, is this something we've always been doing with space flight?    Scott Smith:  Well, nutrition's always been important, first of all.  And, no.  In many cases on most flights, we've not annoyed the crew with nutrition.  Recently, about a year and a half ago, we flew an iPad app to the station that allows the crews to track their dietary intake.  And they report literally everything they eat.  Every single day, every single meal, they go into the app and enter what foods they ate.  Which gives them a real-time look on the iPad of how many calories they're getting.  Are they getting enough fluid?  Are they getting too much sodium?  But as you inferred, we get those data on the ground.  And we work that out to 180 different nutrients of, all the way down into the grid.  We were looking at iodine data this morning, to give you an idea.  And really, when you talk about human health and you talk about what we're trying to do, nutrition becomes very, very important.    Host:  I mean, especially when they're up there for a really long time I would imagine.     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Scott Smith:  Absolutely, absolutely.  And, indeed, on shuttle missions, nutrition was important.  But we always looked at nutrition as a camping trip on a shuttle flight.  That, you know, you could eat pretty much anything for two weeks and get away with it.  When you're up there for a month or three months, six months, it's important.  And as we look to go off beyond low Earth orbit at two and three years Mar's missions.  If you run out of a nutrient on one of those missions, you're going to be in trouble.    Host:  And so we talked a little bit before this.  And, I mean, this is something people have been paying attention to as long as humans have been exploring; right?  I mean, you almost don't think about it.  But then there's some pretty real examples that people will remember.    Scott Smith:  Absolutely.  And I don't think they realized it.  Much like today, they didn't appreciate nutrition.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  You know, and I would say that everybody can see we're going to fly food on space missions because you got to fly food.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  But the idea that we need to pay attention to what's in the food gets lost on a lot of people.  And I always say, you know, if you look back through the history books, nutrition in and of itself made or broke many of those exploration missions here on Earth.    Host:  Like what?    Scott Smith:  Well, the classic example is always scurvy, vitamin C deficiency.  And, you know, if you look at the time span between Columbus' trip and the invention of the steam engine.  It's about a 400-year block there.  Scurvy killed mover than 2 million sailors.    Host:  Really?    Scott Smith:  And it's estimated that scurvy killed more sailors than all other causes of death combined.  And there were ships that went out with hundreds that came back with tens.  It was that big a deal.    Host:  And it all came back to what they were eating?    Scott Smith:  It all came back to what they were eating and what they weren't eating.  That they weren't getting any or enough sources of vitamin C.    Host:  And what did they ultimately do to solve that?  I mean, I think we usually heard like starting eat, start carrying oranges and lemons and stuff; right?     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Scott Smith:  Exactly.    Scott Smith:  The British were called limeys because they used to bring limes on the voyages.  Because they realized that it was something in the citrus fruit.  It wasn't until the 1900s that they actually isolated and realized what that chemical compound was.  But they knew it was in citrus fruit.    Host:  But, I mean, even back then there were kind of attempts to figure out, okay, you know, my ship is coming back a whole lot lighter than it left.    Scott Smith:  Indeed.    Host:  Why the heck is that happening?    Scott Smith:  And, again, over those 400 years there were advances and setbacks.  Even after there was evidence that citrus fruit were the key, there were some captains that insisted that that was not it.  That they maintained that fresh meat and clean kitchens, clean galleys was going to solve this.  And then went out and found out the hard way that that was not true.  And my suspicion is that fresh meat came from the fact that, you know, on those ships, when they had grain and food stored.  They'd had rats stowaway on the ship.  And they would catch the rats.  And some of the crew would eat the rats.  And the crews that ate the rats tended to do better.  Because rats do not need vitamin C in their diet.  Rats can make vitamin C.    Host:  Really?    Scott Smith:  So if you ate the rat, it was an analogous to eating an orange.  Probably a little chewier.  But those crews tended to do better.  And it wasn't until they put all that together.  Well, I'm not sure they ever put the rat thing together.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  But, again, that was missing one single nutrient.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  If we, on a three-year mission, run out of any vitamin, any mineral, it's going to be a bad trip.    Host:  Well, luckily, we've come a whole lot further in the field of nutritional science since then.    Scott Smith:  Indeed.    Host:  So what are, you've been doing this for a while now.  What, I mean, so you're doing it with station now.  But you mentioned shuttle.  What were some of the kind of the early steps that you were taking in this field with space flight?    Scott Smith:  Well, we use any opportunity we can to try to understand how the body changes in weightlessness.  We use a lot of analogs.  We use things like bed-rest studies.  Where we put people to bed for weeks or months on end, trying to see how the body changes in, with disuse.  We've looked at vitamin D studies in the Antarctic, where people don't get sunlight.  Like on spacecraft.  So we study wherever and whatever we can to try to glean information about how the body changes.  And how we can use nutrition to help mitigate negative effects of space flight or to optimize crew health.  So we've done some studies on short-duration shuttle missions.  But it wasn't until we started long-duration flights that we really started to worry about nutrient requirements and what crews needed to eat.  And our first foray into that was the phase one program on the Russian space station Mir.  And we did some studies there looking at things like calcium.  And red blood cell metabolism.  And fluid homeostasis.   And then with the advent of, with the launch of Expedition One, we've been doing nutritional work in some form or other on every mission since then.  So we do nutritional assessments on the space station crews.  We're sort of the working for the flight surgeon.  We collect data on the crews before flight.  During flight.  And after flight.  To make sure that we send astronauts up there as healthy as can be.  That we track them while they're up there to make sure they're staying healthy.  And then when they land, we go off and we collect blood samples and urine samples to see if there are any decrements.  That we work with the rehabilitation team to get crews back to full health as quickly as possible.    Host:  Well, what have you seen?  So you've been doing this on station for a long time now.  You did some stuff on Mir.  What have you guys kind of, what did you start out looking for kind of?  What is the body needing in microgravity that it's not, it wasn't necessarily getting?  Or how did nutrition, let me put it this way.  How did nutrition requirements change for an astronaut as opposed to, you know, me down here on planet Earth?  Or do they?    Scott Smith:  There are a few nuanced differences.  But really many of the basics still apply.  When I meet with the crews before flight, the first thing I tell he them is that, if there's only one thing I can tell you, it's that you need to eat during flight.  And that sounds ridiculous, but you need to maintain your body mass.  You need to get enough calories in you to maintain your body mass.  If you're doing that, that is 70 percent of the battle.  And the reason for that is that, if you're getting enough calories, everything else follows calories.  So if you're getting enough calories, you're probably getting enough of the body weight.  You're probably getting enough of the minerals.  You're probably getting enough fluid.  And when we get caloric intake right, then we start to look at other things.  Like are you getting enough protein?  Are you getting enough calcium?  Are you getting enough potassium?  And we start to fine tune.  But really maintaining body mass is goal one.  We know from many flights that, if you lose weight during flight, that you'll lose more bone than you want to.  You'll lose more muscle than you need to.   Your cardiovascular system doesn't like it.  There's more oxidative damage that occurs if you're not getting enough calories.  So there's a lot of negative things that come along with weight loss in astronauts.  And I always say this is not the weight loss program you want to go on.  Over the years, early on in the Mir program, in the early station, we saw a lot of crews lose weight.  There were a lot of people that maintained that, well, astronauts just lose weight in flight.  We need to accept that that's normal.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  And I always fault that.  And it wasn't until, in 2008 was when we flew the, what we call the ARED, the advanced resistive exercise device.  That device that allowed really heavy resistive exercise.  And what we showed in the first crews that used that was that, if you ate well.  Maintained your body mass.  Had good vitamin D status.  And exercised hard.  You could maintain your bone mineral density.  And my throw down on there was always that in 50 years of flying people in space, that was the first time we ever saw crews coming back with the same bone mineral density they left with.    Host:  And it was by actually paying attention to.     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Scott Smith:  Nutrition and exercise.    Host:  Every factor not just accepting, hey, this is something we got to live with.    Scott Smith:  Exactly, exactly.  And, you know, the adage always is that, you know, good nutrition won't make you an Olympic athlete.  But if you're an Olympic athlete, bad nutrition will ruin you.  And it's the same mantra.  That, you know, we come up with an exercise that does a really good job of fixing muscle loss.    Host:  Yeah, yeah.    Scott Smith:  But if you're not providing enough fuel to support that exercise, that exercise won't work.    Host:  And then how are you guys actually making sure that the crew members are getting what they need?    Scott Smith:  We, in two ways.  Again, we have an iPad app that the crews track dietary intake.  That allows them to see literally at lunchtime what they need to eat for dinner to get enough calories.  It's got a little bar at the bottom of the page that starts off at red.  And as they eat more calories, it turns to green.  So we push them daily, hour by hour to get to the top of that bar.  We track their body mass.  And if they're losing weight, again, that's the tell.  And we've had some crew members that, you know, when we say you're not eating enough.  You're not getting enough calories.  They will, you know, push back and say, look, I feel fine.  You know, I feel like I'm eating enough.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I always tell them, if you're losing weight, I'm right.  That it's possible your metabolic rate is different.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  Maybe lower than it is on Earth.  Or lower than we think it is.  But, again, the body weight is the tell.  That, if you're body mass is going down, there's something wrong.  And one of the things that we've come to, and I don't have data to back this up.  But I think one of the things that happens during flight is that food doesn't settle in your stomach the same way as it does on Earth.    Host:  Really?    Scott Smith:  So as you eat here on Earth, eventually your stomach will tell your brain that you're full.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  In space what I think what happens is because the food in your stomach is experiencing the same weightlessness, it probably is stretching that stomach more.  So hitting the top of your stomach more, which is, signals your brain that you're done.  Even though you haven't really eaten that much.  And I tell crews, again, you've got to get food in you.  And if you're losing weight, you either need to push more food in even when you think you're full.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  Or you need to eat more meals.  You need to spread it out during the day and snack more.  Or whatever it takes to get more calories in you.    Host:  It's actually interesting.  We've been asked that question before.  You know, does the digestive system change at all?  And it's always kind of a, no, we don't think so.  So that might actually be out there still.  So we're still learning stuff.    Scott Smith:  Exactly, exactly.    Host:  Are there foods that you try to make them eat more of?  Eat less of?  Because, I mean, everything's pretty regulated, I would imagine.    Scott Smith:  Well, there's a couple ways to answer that.  We, the food system is somewhat limited.  And it is repetitive.  So every eight days or so they change out the containers and get a new set of the same thing every eight days.  So there's not a lot we can tell them to do.  And for a lot of reasons we don't, you know, obviously, I try not to nag them on, you know, I don't want to be the guy telling them to eat more broccoli.  Especially if they hate broccoli.  But trying to get a balanced meal in them.  And trying, you know, one of the challenges we have is getting enough food up there.  Enough variety of food that each individual crew member can find enough things that will make them happy.  So for the crew, if it doesn't like broccoli, will they eat asparagus?  Will they eat green beans?  Will they eat something else?  Because you got to get something green in you no matter what.  As we look out to exploration missions and the challenges there, we want an optimal diet.   We want an optimized diet.  And in our view that means more fruits and vegetables.  Which have phytochemicals that come along with that.  It means more sources of omega three fatty acids.  So things like salmon and fish and walnuts.  And, again, doing what we can with that personal choice of making sure the crews are interested enough in eating that they're going to eat.  You know, again, go back to their eight-day rotating menu.  I would say, if you pick your eight favorite days of food and you cycle it enough, after enough times you're going to get bored.  I don't care if it's steak and lobster and whatever else.  Whatever it is you like.    Host:  I feel like I've already been doing that the last five years of my life.    Scott Smith:  If you eat the same thing every Tuesday.    Host:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.    Scott Smith:  Sooner or later we know you get bored of that.    Host:  I think every college student can attest to that.    Scott Smith:  Exactly.  You can only do ramen so many days in a row.    Host:  Well, so what about, you know, the future?  What are you guys already looking at that you're considering is going to have to change upwind.  Because we have crew members up in the air for six months.  We had Scott Kelly up there for a year.    Scott Smith:  Yeah.    Host:  What's going to change in the world of nutrition?  What are you guys, you know, not necessarily worried about.  But what problems are you already trying to solve?  Or anticipating if someone's going to be up there for two, three years at a time?    Scott Smith:  We're still, there's a number of serious health concerns that we worry about.  That, again, a six-month mission is worse than a three-month mission is worse than a two-week mission.  And then when you add in a year or two-year mission, it just, it exacerbates that.  We worry about things like bone loss.  And muscle loss.  And how your cardiovascular system works.  We worry about the immune system function.  And all four of those are intertwined with nutrition.  We know, if you don't eat well, your immune system function doesn't work as well.  We know from our work in the Antarctic that, if you are stressed and you're vitamin D status is low.  You will reactivate more viruses, which is a function of your immune system, than you want.  Your behavior.  Your performance.  Your morale are all based on how well you're eating.  How well you're sleeping goes hand in hand with how well you're eating.   So lots of different months of human adaptation rely on a good food system and good food intake.  And then you take into account the fact that you're in a spacecraft.  You're in microgravity.  The air is closed.  So any contaminants in the air can alter that.  There's some things, you know, high levels of carbon dioxide can affect different nutrient metabolism.  It can affect bone loss.  Different chemicals and contaminants in the air can affect nutrient requirements like folate.  And other vitamins can be exacerbated by that.  And one of the bigger, if not the biggest issue we chase is radiation.  And that's one of those things that, again, it's, radiation exposure is higher on station than it is on Earth.  But when you leave the protection of low Earth orbit, it gets really bad.  So radiation exposure on a moon mission or Mars mission and how we protect from that is going to be serious.    Host:  And that's something nutrition can help address?    Scott Smith:  That is something that nutrition can help address.    Host:  How?    Scott Smith:  When you look at, you know, studies on the ground.  People that eat more broccoli and cauliflower, cruciferous vegetables, get less cancer.    Host:  Wow.    Scott Smith:  Do we know exactly why?  No, we do not.  And we, you know, people are always looking for what vitamin is it that I can take a pill of that will mitigate that?  We don't have that yet.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  And there's been a number of studies done where for a while we thought vitamin A was going to cure cancer.  Vitamin E was going to cure cancer.  And we did long-term prospective studies where, you know, ten-year studies where we looked at vitamin E supplementation.  Or vitamin A supplementation.  Beta carotene supplementation.  And when they do those big studies, big controlled studies, what they find is that taking vitamins does not mitigate that risk.  But, again, when you compare to people that eat more vegetables, they get less cancer.  Now, there's a couple things intertwined in there that you need to be careful of.  One is that there are thousands of these, what we call phytochemicals that occur in things like broccoli.  And we don't understand all of them.  So it may be that it's not just vitamin E or vitamin A.    Host:  It's some mix of.    Scott Smith:  It's some mix of those other things.  The other thing is that the more broccoli you eat, the fewer french fries you eat.  The fewer, less red meat you eat.    Host:  That's true.    Scott Smith:  And those things likely antagonize oxidative damage and cancer incidence.  So it really, you know, I always hate to say it, but your mother was right.  And eating your vegetables really does matter.    Host:  I'll make sure they does not listen to this podcast.  Well, so what are some of the other major changes for when we have people in space for a really long time?  One thing that I have written down here, need less iron and sodium.  Now, why does that happen?  What is the body going through that that becomes the case?    Scott Smith:  Two different things there.  One, with iron, your iron stores go up during space flight because your blood volume contracts.  So when you go into space flight, that, what happens is your blood volume goes down by about 10 to 15 percent.    Host:  Really?    Scott Smith:  Yeah.  And, again, I don't have date to back this up exactly.  But what I think happens, the way I explain this in my head is that it's easier for the body to pump blood to your toenails than it is on Earth.  You don't have gravity fighting against you, so it's easier to pump the blood.  You don't have blood pooling in your, you know, in your feet.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  So your body can get away with a smaller blood volume.  And what happens because of that is your blood volume contracts, again, by about 10 or 15 percent.  What happens is, as you breakdown the red blood cells you don't need, you put that iron into stores, okay.  So you don't need as much iron as you need on Earth, first of all.  Second of all, when you have higher iron stores, and we know this from a lot of studies on Earth that have nothing to do with space flight.  Higher iron stores are associated with higher oxidative damage in tissues.  And we've actually shown that with high, the astronauts that have higher iron stores.  Because they ate more iron.  Because they had higher stores to begin with, have more oxidative damage to their DNA.  And have more bone loss secondary to that oxidative stress.  So we try to minimize the amount of iron they're getting in their diet.  Now, that's not to say, you know, we'd be happy with the RDA.   Which is about 8 or 10 milligrams of iron per day.  The standard food system right now has about 25 milligrams a day.  And depending on how each astronaut picks their food, if you pick foods that are, you know, either high in iron.  Like sources of meat.  Or fortified foods like breakfast drinks.  And cereals that are fortified with iron.  We've seen crews get 30, 40, 50 milligrams of iron a day.  Which is a good four or five, six times the RDA.    Host:  What's RDA?    Scott Smith:  The recommended dietary allowance.    Host:  Okay.    Scott Smith:  So that's the, you know, when you look at the food package in the grocery store.    Host:  Yep.    Scott Smith:  It's based on your typical dietary intake, if you will.    Host:  Got you.    Scott Smith:  So we're not looking to reduce iron below what your average person needs.  But on Earth we tend to worry about the opposite.  We worry about people being iron deficient.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  Most nutrients follow what we call a bell-shaped curve.  That is, that at the bottom end of the bell-shaped curve, you don't want to be in the bottom 5 percent.     [ Multiple Speakers ]  But the reality is you don't want to be, you don't to have too much either.    Host:  Yep.    Scott Smith:  And we're starting to see that in terrestrial science that individuals that have higher iron stores have higher cardiovascular diseases.  Have higher cerebrovascular diseases.  That is, blood vessel changes and brain changes.  And, again, we're seeing decrements, problems with having too much iron that are just as bad as problems of having too little iron.  Sodium, on the other hand, is one of those things that we worry about crews using too much sodium for the same reason as on Earth.  Because too much sodium is bad for you.    Host:  But it tastes so good.    Scott Smith:  And that is the problem.  Not only that it tastes really good, but it's cheap.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  So if you want to make something taste better and not cost much, throw some salt on it.    Host:  A little bit of salt, yeah.    Scott Smith:  You could do the same thing with spices.  Spices are a lot more expensive.  So if you're a food company trying to make whatever, macaroni and cheese.  You know, or soup.  Or whatever you want.  It's much cheaper and much more palatable to add sodium to it.    Host:  But you're not watching out for sodium for any particular reason when [inaudible]?     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Scott Smith:  Well, one of the key, well, there's several things we're concerned about.  On Earth, with sodium, we worry about blood pressure.  And we're not worried about that in astronauts.  Because blood pressure actually is a little bit lower during flight.  The astronauts, by virtue of the selection process, typically don't have blood pressure issues.  High sodium levels are bad for bone, which is something we're concerned about.  And there's the potential that high sodium intakes can exacerbate some of the fluid volume issues.  And some of the eye issues that have jumped up in recent years.  And that is one of the reasons why we reformulated our food system, I think about five years ago now, to be much lower in sodium than it was.  So we actually reduced the sodium content of the space foods by about 40 percent compared to what they were to try to help with some of these health issues.  And the big one was, the big driver was eye issues.    Host:  Eye issues.  So we've talked about bone and muscles.  And even radiation.  But the vision issues.  So, and for those that don't know, some of the astronauts actually experience a loss in their visual acuity.  Their vision gets worse over long-duration space flight.  And then it always doesn't get better; is that correct?    Scott Smith:  That's exactly right.  That we, I'll say around eight years ago or so, nine years ago realized that we had some crew members coming back having had eye and vision issues.  I say vision issues because it's easier to say than ophthalmologic issues.    Host:  That is easier.    Scott Smith:  And in some cases it's a change in what we call refraction.  Which is your ability to focus.  Some of them are a little more nuanced than that.  Where, when the eye docs do an examine of the astronauts after flight, they see changes in the back of the eye that some astronauts have had, but didn't realize they had.  So it's not necessarily perceptible by the astronaut.  But there's a varied pattern of five or so different things that occur with the eye.  Changes in ability to focus.  Changes in the back of the eye, what they called cotton wool spots.  Which are little spots that occur on the back of the eye.  Changes in the shape of the eye.  Number of things going on.  As I said, up until about seven, eight, nine years ago, we didn't realize that was a problem.  Now, when that came up, we all collectively blustered down the intracranial pressure pathway, as I call it.  That is, the thinking was, the theory was that, when you go into space flight, the fluid shifts.   And you get more blood and fluid up into your head.  That that pressure inside your head pushes on the back of your eye.  Pushes on your optic nerve.  And that intracranial pressure leads to these eye changes.  Now, what is important to keep in mind, and the drum I continually bang is what you said at the outset.  Which is some astronauts develop this.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  It's not all of them.    Host:  It's not.    Scott Smith:  So it can't just be as simple as, when you go into flight, the fluid goes up, pushes on your eye.    Host:  Because they all have that.    Host:  Right.  They all have that.  We at one point, and there's still some thinking that it might be related to carbon dioxide.  Because carbon dioxide in the air is higher during space flight than it is on Earth.  The cabin on, the cabin CO2 on ISS is higher than the CO2 you and I are breathing.  Maybe not in this room.    Host:  There's good airflow in here.  It's a small room.  There's good airflow.    Scott Smith:  Okay.  No worries.  It may be CO2.  It may be fluid shifts.  It may be something else.  But what we always come back to is that it is only affecting some of the astronauts.  Now, when this came up, we went to the flight docs and said, look, you know, we've got a lot of data.  We've done this experiment on space station.  We've collected blood.  We've collected urine.  We've looked at a lot of nutritional markers and biochemistry markers.  Maybe we have something that could help understand this.  And when we dug into the data, and today's February 16th.  It was February 18th of 2011 that my colleague Sarah [inaudible] came into my office and said there's something going on with one carbon metabolism.  And without boring you with all the details, what she found was differences in the blood biochemistry of the astronauts that had these vision issues before flight.    Host:  Before flight.    Scott Smith:  Before flight we saw differences in the blood in astronauts that subsequently developed eye issues.    Host:  So with that you could potentially tell before somebody even went into space.    Scott Smith:  Indeed.    Host:  Whether or not they have that issue.    Scott Smith:  Indeed.  So we followed up on that.  We presented that to life sciences management.  We ruled out as many things as we could.  You know, the possibility that it was vitamin deficiencies.  Or kidney function.  Or all these different things.  We ruled those all out.  And what we then hypothesized was that it was related to genetics.  That there were genetic differences, in the literature we knew there were genetic differences that affected the chemicals we were looking at.  And these affect the population.  That's sort of like blood types.  That people have different blood types.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  You're either blood type A or B or O. It's not a good blood type or a bad blood type, there's just different blood types.  There's differences in genetics that affect these chemicals.  And we hypothesized that that may be why these chemical differences are there.  And there may be something related to that which is causing those individuals to be predisposed to developing these eye issues on space station.  So we did a study where we proposed looking at a handful of these genetic differences.  We sat down with 70 astronauts and said, you know, look, here's the story.  Here's the data we've got.  Here's the theory.  We'd like to collect some blood from you and look at your genes.  We said it was 70 astronauts, and all 70 of them agreed to give us blood.  Which gives you an idea of how compelling the story was to them.  And how big a deal this is to astronauts.  And how much they want to understand this to figure this out.    Host:  I always say they're incredibly selfless because they're basically guinea pigs.    Scott Smith:  Yeah, absolutely.    Host:  While they're up there.    Scott Smith:  Absolutely.     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Host:  So it's incredible that they're.    Scott Smith:  And the astronauts as a whole are great about doing experiments.  But I always, you know, I've always said, all the astronauts will never agree to anything.  That, you know, there's always 95 percent of them.  There's always one or two, they're like, well, I don't like to collect blood or.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  Cardiovascular study.  Or I don't want to do that sleep study.  I've never even everybody sign up for a study until now.    Host:  And so it's still ongoing?    Scott Smith:  It, we're in stage two now.  But when we collected the blood, we did a small look at the genetics.  And found, indeed, that there was a genetic predisposition for some astronauts to develop these eye issues.  And we now need to follow up on that.  We're doing some more extended work.  Again, I can talk to you a long time about that.  But I'd be more boring than I already am.  And it gets pretty gnarly into the genetics and the biochemistry.  But I am convinced that we are at the cusp of this thing.  And if we can work it out to where we can study this in a little more detail, that we will solve this problem.    Host:  Wow.    Scott Smith:  To where we can get into what we call personalized medicine.  And we can look and say, okay, we know these individuals are going to be, are at risk of this developing.  Here's how we go try to counteract that.    Host:  Really?  And so that's the important part.  Is it's not identifying, hey, this is going to happen to you.  It's, hey, this might happen to you, and this is how we stop it.     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Scott Smith:  And here's how we fix it.  Absolutely.    Host:  And so we've come all the way from why is half of my ship dying from some crazy thing.  To now we're looking at eyes.  So it seems like, obviously, it's a constantly evolving field.  Are there other things or anything on the horizon that you think you're going to be diving into next?    Scott Smith:  Well, right now the vision thing is, as I call it, is the biggest thing we're chasing.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  And that is one of the top concerns that NASA management has in terms of health risks.  One of the interesting spinoffs of the work that we've done is that, is we wrote up the genetic data.  We published that in a scientific paper.  One of the realizations we came to was that the astronauts that developed these vision issues had a long list of characteristics.  This chemistry.  The genetics.  Changes in their retinal nerves.  Changes in some of their hormones.  There was a list of about eight or nine things that we had that we found a clinical population that had the exact same set of characteristics.  And that is women with polycystic ovary syndrome.    Host:  Really?    Scott Smith:  Really.  Polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS as they call it, is the leading cause of infertility in women.  It affects 10 to 20 percent of women.  Which is a staggering incidence.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  And what we maintain is that, you know, I talked a lot about analogs.  That we look at the Antarctic as analog to study vitamin D. Or we look at bed rest as an analog for studying bone loss.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  We maintain that women with polycystic ovary syndrome might be the analog population we need to study to figure out what's different about them.  And how that relates to astronauts during space flight.    Host:  Go you.  I was wondering, like, what, so if you find that out, what's the purpose of finding that out [inaudible]?    Scott Smith:  Because we can then study their cardiovascular function.  We can study their eyes.  We can study, you know, different elements of their physiology to understand what's different about them.  Because, theoretically, if we flew women with PCOS in space, again theoretically, they would all develop these eye issues.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  We've started a study that we're doing with the Mayo Clinic up in Minnesota.  Working with an endocrinologist who specializes in PCOS and a neuroophthalmologist.  Which is even harder to say.  A neuroophthalmologist that specializes in intracranial hypertension.  And they're off recruiting women with PCOS.  Patients with intracranial hypertension.  Where they're collecting blood and shipping them to us and doing eye exams.  And, again, we hope to piece together the first bits of that.  So we can then test our hypotheses for what we think is the relationship between your genetics and your eyes.  And how those change during space flight.  So that, you know, again, ultimately those studies can help us better understand how to prevent astronauts from having eye issues.  The more staggering thing is that we might be able to help terrestrial medicine to understand how to better treat individuals with that syndrome.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  And I'm always struck by one of the cases where we published the genetic data back in 2016.  And when we published the paper, NASA put a story on the web about, you know, that we published the study.  And what we found and what it meant.  And I got an e-mail from a woman working at one of the other NASA centers who asked if we'd looked at this one eye issue called papilledema.  And I said, well, in our paper we called it choroidal folds.  But I'm told they're about the same thing.  But, yes, we did and here's a copy of the paper.  And she wrote back and said.  Well, to share too much, I six, seven years ago was diagnosed with papilledema.  That there was some sort of pressure pushing on the back of my eye that they couldn't figure out why.  Along the way I was diagnosed with B12 deficiency.  Which is one of the things intertwined with the genetics we're looking at.  And, oh, yeah, by the way, she's got PCOS.    Host:  Wow.    Scott Smith:  And that could be a coincidence.  I don't think so.    Host:  Wow.    Scott Smith:  And she said, when she had mentioned to her physicians that maybe these things were interrelated.  And she said they scoffed at her and said, no, that can't be.  So, again, we talk a lot about spinoffs from the space program.  It is mind-boggling to think that by studding this in more depth.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  We might be able to help 10 to 20 percent of the population.    Host:  Wow.  Well, wow, I've said that like a million times already.  But, wow.     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Host:  Keep going.    Host:  So besides the vision, everything that we've been learning on the space station about trying to solve the vision issue.  Bones.  Muscle.  And cardiovascular everything.  How are you feeling with what we know right now about supporting the nutrition for our crews, say going to Mars?  Going into space for two years?    Scott Smith:  Again, the human research program has a top four, if you will.  And I don't mean to speak for HRP, but their top four our radiation.  Behavior and performance.  Vision.  And food.  And I say food intentionally.  It's not nutrition.  Because the reality is for a Mars mission, the food is probably going to go to Mars before the crew leaves Earth.  So we need to have a food system that is stable for five years.  Meaning you could go to the grocery store right now.  Pack your pantry.  And in five years still be eating that food.  And make sure that it's got everything you need in it.    Host:  And I imagine there's a million and one challenges.     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Scott Smith:  And it's extremely tough to do.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  It's extremely tough to do.  The food system folks are working really hard on developing foods that are more stable.  Working on packaging that will help facilitate that.  But, again, when you think about it, when you find something in the back of your pantry that's been in there are for a while.  It's got an expiration date on it.  The expiration date is because it probably doesn't taste that good.  The reason it probably doesn't taste that good after that date is because the nutrients that are in there break down and make other chemicals that aren't what they were supposed to be.  So it tastes funky or it looks funky.  So from a pure food point of view, there's a lot of issues.  From a nutrition point of view, we need to make sure we've got the basics down.  One of the nice things we have on space station is that, every time a vehicle goes up, there's some fresh food in there.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  There's, you know, oranges.  And lemons.  And apples.  And different types of fruits and vegetables.    Host:  Got to stave off the scurvy.    Scott Smith:  Exactly.  And we really don't know how much that little bit of fresh food mitigates concerns we have about the rest of the food system.  We're not going to have the ability to do that with a Mars crew.  So we need to be very sure of that.  We need to make very sure the food, again, is good enough that the crew's going to want to eat it.  We're going to make sure that the crew is motivated enough that they're going to want to eat it.  That they're exercising hard enough to maintain their body to keep, again, that whole thing going.  So it, you know, when you look at scientists, we all tend to focus on our little system.  So there's a bone lab.  And a muscle lab.  And a cardiovascular lab.  And a nutrition lab.  We're dealing with a human.  And that whole thing has to work.  And that still gives me a significant amount of pause.  We don't really know what extent the effects of the radiation system are going to be.  Chronic, relatively low dose, but much higher than on Earth.  Levels of radiation for long periods of time can affect, you know, I was at a meeting last week where the radiation folks talked about that.   And talked about how, you know, you get dementia-like problems with extended radiation exposure.  And, again, from a nutrition point of view, I will tell you that in the elderly with dementia and cognition problems, folate.  Which is one of the vitamins, vitamin B12 are key nutrients when it comes to cognition.  And one of the things that we think is going on is that radiation affects the ability to get those vitamins into the brain.  So there are a lot of challenges ahead of us that we really do not understand.  If we had a vehicle that was ready to go tomorrow.  We had a food system that was ready to go tomorrow.  Do we know enough about what it really is going to take to protect crews on a three-year trip to Mars?  Those really are scary questions.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  Really they are.    Host:  Well, luckily we still got an International Space Station and some time to figure all that out.  I've taken up a bunch of your time.  Anything else that I didn't hit on that you're dying to go tell the world about nutritional biochemistry?    Scott Smith:  No.  I think we've hit most of the key points.  We, you know, are working as hard as we can.  And I always like to step back from the realization that, you know, I get to come sit here with you and tell you the great stuff we're doing.  Realize I've got a lab full of folks that are back at the lab working hard.  That are doing the really hard work.  And they should get most of the credit.  But I don't let them out of the lab so, you know, they're working.  But it really is a phenomenal team effort that helps to bring all this together.   Host:  How's their vitamin D intake?    Scott Smith:  We let them out in the sun every once in a while.  But it is a tremendous team effort within our group.  And then we work with a number of other groups.  We work with the cardiovascular lab to try to understand a lot of the cardiovascular and vision issues that we've talked about.  Work with the immune lab.  Work with the muscle lab.  We work with a lot of other folks.  There really is a tremendous team environment trying to pull this thing together.  It's not, really is not just me.    Host:  Well, you're all doing some incredible work right now.  And looking forward to the next breakthroughs in the years to come.    Scott Smith:  Thanks.    Host:  And what the future holds.  Again, I was just talking with Dr. Scott Smith, the manager of nutritional biochemistry here at the Johnson Space Center.  Scott, thanks so much for joining me today.    Scott Smith:  Thank you.

        title: 'Houston, We Have a Podcast. Episode 150 Technology vs Space',
        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 150, “Technology vs. Space.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. Space is a very harsh environment, intense temperatures of 200 °F in the sun and -200 °F in the shade. You hear about the vacuum of space and space radiation, micro gravity, debris, atomic oxygen. So, you have to ask yourself, what kinds of new technologies can hold up in an environment like this? Not just if they hold up, but how do they hold up and by how much and what exactly is happening to those materials and electronics, even solar cells? Just down the street from NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston is a small company called Alpha Space, and they manage a commercial R&D facility on the International Space Station called [Materials International Space Station Experiment] MISSE, M-I-S-S-E. This facility is mounted on the outside of the space station with pallets of hundreds of different technologies at a time. It's exposed to the harsh environment of space in low-Earth orbit where the International Space Station flies. Materials, circuit cards, [Central Processing Unit] CPUs, solar cells, and more fly up to the station on a cargo craft. They're brought inside by astronauts who, then, send these technologies outside through an airlock. They're exposed to space for a while then brought back inside and put in a cargo vehicle for delivery back to Earth for analysis. We've learned a lot about how technologies hold up in space, and this can inform designs for future space missions, but can also improve products you buy on Earth like paints, coatings, and household electronics. So, here to tell us about this organization and commercial facility is Wesley Gordon. He goes by Wes. He's the Program Manager for the MISSE facility at Alpha Space. Wes talks about the history of MISSE, the technologies that are flying right now, and the process of getting these technologies on the International Space Station. So, here we go. “Technology vs. Space” with Wes Gordon. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Wes, thanks for coming on Houston, We Have a Podcast today.  Wes Gordon: Thank you, sir.  Host: So, you are the MISSE Project Manager?  Wes Gordon: The Program Manager for MISSE.  Host: Program Manager.  Wes Gordon: Yes, sir.  Host: Let's start with a little bit of background. What is MISSE? What is this thing we're going to be talking about today?  Wes Gordon: So, MISSE is a commercial science and product development R&D type platform to expose science to space. So, in doing so, what we have is a facility that sits on orbit where every six months, we interact and swap out payloads to put science and experiments, anything people want to research and do development work on and expose it to the various factors of the space environment for them.  Host: We're talking outside the space station.  Wes Gordon: Yes, sir.  Host: OK.  Wes Gordon: Outside the space station, so there's a lot of research and a lot of capabilities inside the space station. We provide capabilities for direct external exposure on the space station.  Host: OK. So, what is unique, what is interesting about that exposure? What are the things you, like, are we talking radiation? Are we talking vacuum? Are we talking extreme temperature swings?  Wes Gordon: Right. So, what you're going to get on that activity is you get the extreme temperature.  Host: OK.  Wes Gordon: You get the extreme vacuum. You get the atomic oxygen.  Host: What's that?  Wes Gordon: It's a single molecule oxygen that you don't get on Earth's presence.  Host: We have O2.  Wes Gordon: Yes.  Host: OK.  Wes Gordon: And, you get a single molecule version of it, atomic oxygen, on orbit. The other thing, like you were mentioning, is you get the UV exposure unblocked and uninterrupted. We get the radiation exposure and expected radiation exposure that you wouldn't get. So, you can see how that works. But, more importantly are those, just extreme temperatures. The combination of those temperatures and vacuum and all those factors in a single point for people to understand truly how their materials are going to react.  Host: Yeah.  Wes Gordon: You know, on the ground, we can simulate pieces. We can make something hot. We can make something cold, right. But we can't bring everything together into one combined atmosphere to replicate space. And, that's the value of the MISSE facility and what it brings to any product in any industry that's out there.  Host: If you look at a picture of the MISSE facility, you can see it kind of looks like palettes, and there's little circles of different colors. You know, for my untrained eye, they just look like pretty colors on the side. But I'm thinking what's happening is these are different materials, these are different technologies that you're putting in these little circles, and then that is just a little sample of the thing that you want to test.  Wes Gordon: Absolutely. So, what happens is we have about 200 square inches of exposure space on a facility, on each of the MISSEs, and there's 12 exposure surfaces that we can put you on, ram, zenith, wake, and nadir. So, what happens is when you, when we put you up there, you provide, a lot of folks provide a one inch by one-inch square sample or a one-inch circular sample of what they would like to evaluate and test. And, that gives them sufficient material to see how the material's going to react. And, using our facility for those material purposes and the photo capabilities that we have, we can give you visual results, which we provide you once a month by taking pictures, because the facility's capable of taking pictures as you go through the flight. We give you health and science data, so we have the UV data, how much contamination we've had, what the solar exposure is, temperatures that you're exposed to. So, that way, they can take that information, and then, when their science is returned, they can do further evaluation and testing combined with the data we gave to see if their material or their experiment reached the science point that they wanted to. There's the other side of our facility, which people are starting to get into and starting to fully understand is the fact that we're capable of providing data and power capability as well. So, we can do active experiments and do other testing for folks. One of the things that we get into that we've been doing is like an antenna system. If you wanted to evaluate a new antenna system out of a new material or you wanted to check its ability to transmit something via the ground. How does it respond in those kinds of conditions? You're able to do that with our facility.  Host: So, we're talking like, instead of just putting it out there and seeing what happens, are you sending commands to the antenna? Oh OK.  Wes Gordon: Yes, we have telemetry and command capability, right.  Host: Interesting.  Wes Gordon: The other thing is if you've got a particular circuit because the whole goal of a lot of the active experiments is can I get to TRL-8? Is it qualified for space, right? What is the way to do that? MISSE provides a really good, low cost, effective way to do it on a very fast cadence. And so, if you have a circuit card, or a module, or a new component, a new CPU, a new resistor, something you want to test, it's really easy to integrate that into our deck so you get the exposure to space, the harshness of space, and what does your science do? So, we provide you power. We can provide you power and data, and you can interact with your science to get data and validate your experiment.  Host: When you were going over some of the details of how this works, one thing that kind of caught my ear was you talked about you can put the palette on different positions, facing different ways, as the International Space Station's flying, whether it's forward, whether it's toward space, whether it's more towards the Earth. What are the differences there? What are some things are valuable to point it a different way?  Wes Gordon: Yeah, it's the existence of, for example, the UV exposure, whether they want direct exposure on zenith, where we put, for example, solar cells. We do a lot of solar cell testing. We have a solar cell test bed that we've developed and to test those solar cells that sits on zenith. It gets good zero beta exposure, good solar activity, no shading from the ISS. So, they get that exposure. If you're just looking at your atomic oxygen, we can face you accordingly for that. If you just want space exposure, which some people just like, \"Let me see how my exposure works in space,\" right. We can expose you or even underneath our decks.  Host: Oh.  Wes Gordon: For that exposure as well.  Host: Wow. It's a lot of, I'm already thinking about a lot of planning going on here because I'm visualizing this facility, right, and I'm thinking about every little dot, and all those dots is a different material, possibly a different client with different needs, and you have to figure it out. So, it's like kind of a Tetris puzzle of where you want to put things.  Wes Gordon: Yeah. The trick in that is that's the simplicity we provide for our clients and our customers, right, is they provide us exactly what they're looking to achieve, and then we resolve the rest of the problems for them.  Host: Oh, very nice.  Wes Gordon: Right. So, we figure out how they’re placed, how they're sorted, how they're organized. You know, if they tell us what they're looking to achieve or the science they're looking to collect, we can tell them which face they need to be on and what would provide them the best results. Some of the PIs do know, right, our Principal Investigators and our clients do know what they're looking at, but if they don't, we provide that service. We design the holders. We design the decks that these units go on, and we do all the certification testing, all the environmental testing, and all of the activities that need to happen. So, once you've identified your material and you give us the information on the material or an active payload and science and we work to those technical aspects and we get it up there, we do the work and we bring you the results back. And, you can evaluate your science.  Host: OK.  Wes Gordon: We've really, Alpha Space has put significant effort into simplifying that process, right? When you look outside of, and you look at the science and the R&D and the technical community, there's a very limited pool off people who know how to certify and fly hardware into space. And, cheaply and effectively, right, and that's what we specialize in. When you're looking at a low-cost way in the sub-10,000 range to fly one of your samples, we can do that. And, you don't need to know what are the environmental exposures, what are the vibration requirements, what are any of the thermal activities. You know, you don't have to know any of that. We do work with you and explain to you up front that your material's going to be subjected to this, so we help them if we need to, to design it so that it will handle launch vibration. Because that's part of our testing before we go up. So, we work very, very collectively with our clients and our investigators. But they key is making that as easy as possible and as simple as possible for them because the certification for flight process can be complicated if it's not something you do on a day to day basis and you're not configured to do so.  Host: You mentioned your business, Alpha Space.  Wes Gordon: Yes sir.  Host: This is where MISSE is going through. I want to take a little bit of history and set some context to why it is the way it is right now because, MISSE, as I was doing a little bit of research, is, has a lot of history with the International Space Station going back to its very beginnings. Let's talk about the history of MISSE and then how that transitioned into becoming part of Alpha Space.  Wes Gordon: Yes, sir. So, for the first eight missions of MISSE starting back in 2001, so you're talking back in ISS history.  Host: Yeah.  Wes Gordon: In 2001, the facility was owned and operated by NASA, and at that time, it was EVA serviceable. So, when they wanted to do work to it, it was EVA based. And, that's how the activities occurred with it. Throughout the cycle of handling that work and going through that work, it was identified that easier serviceability and easier exchange method needed to be developed. And, that's where Alpha Space came in. So, Miss Stephanie [Murphy] founded Alpha Space in 2015, right after [MEI Technologies, Inc.] MEIT was awarded a contract for building this facility. And, Alpha Space was launched. She launched the first minority female owned space company, commercial space company, actually, to assist in commercializing space in conjunction with NASA to put samples on orbit and to make this a robotically accessible and easily maintainable facility. That's the pure essence of where, you know, Alpha Space started from. There was a need for that robotic and that rapid sample exchange, and access to science, right, access for the public to that science, which is one of the directions in the commercialization that's going. And, Miss Stephanie has done a wonderful job in guiding a company to do and create just that whole purpose. You know, giving access. We have access, now, for universities, commercial companies. NASA's always on our payloads and work with us, right. And so, you have access. Any industry that wants to get into space or evaluate their products in space, automotive industry. They evaluate parts using us to see just what extremes they can expose their parts to, right? Easy access. They don't have to understand how it happens. They just know that it needs to go up. We certify it safely and bring them their data. And, that's the key.  Host: I'm seeing it, because if it was, you know, from a NASA facility, what Alpha Space did was basically commercialize it. You're talking about efficiency. You're talking about bringing in more and different clientele. So, that's the whole idea of the commercial space now owned and operated by you. You're the ones going out and finding the commercial, finding partners or finding clients and helping them and guiding them through the process, working with NASA. You have a history of doing so. So, it seems like a very intertwined relationship to make that work.  Wes Gordon: Yeah, and establishment of a stronger cadence as to what we've been doing, right? You know, we launch carriers on orbit every six months. So, every six months, we are exchanging R&D experiments, science, any of those platforms and activities we carry, that's the cadence we're hitting. Every six months, we exchange something on orbit. And, it's usually three to four of our carriers and the work that we're doing. And, at the same time, we also are putting significant effort into focusing and upgrading, in enhancements and, you know, what can we aid and what data can we gather and what can we do to better service that science and that research. You know, because the biggest key is like you pointed out for the history of MISSE. MISSE originally was considered just a materials, research, and science facility. Right.  Host: M-I-S-S-E. I get it. Yeah, materials. OK.  Wes Gordon: So, we've taken that a step further because our carriers, it's a universal platform, and it has the power. It has the data. It's easily upgradable. It's, I'll call it fairly moldable to fit the needs, right. We do have a volume constraint in some instances, but we also have flexibility to adjust that even for what we're doing to where we can use a whole carrier, if you need it. You can use a half a carrier, if you need it. Or, we get you down, like I mentioned, half an inch exposed or underneath the deck if you just want that space exposure. Then, we put you under the deck. And so, we've added such a huge, huge flexibility in that and a huge capability to a market that didn't see or have the flexibility before.  Host: I want to better understand this terminology you're saying. You're talking about a carrier. Is a carrier one section of the whole facility, or is it a palette of materials? What's a --  Wes Gordon: Yeah, so let's explain the facility a little bit.  Host: OK.  Wes Gordon: I give everybody a good understanding. So, there's a steel structure, the MISSE FF, the flight facility that's on orbit.  Host: That's the whole thing.  Wes Gordon: That's the whole thing.  Host: OK.  Wes Gordon: In the center of the facility are what we call our two avionics boxes. That's a switch box and the power and data box. That's where the commanding and switching comes from pro to control the switching’s for our power on, power off, and those activities. The power and data box provides that power to each of those compartments. So, on each of the four faces, there's three carriers. A lot of people consider them suitcases, if you will, right. And so, what we do is we send up this clamshell type device, the MISSE carrier. It's an MSC, and it gets installed by robots. The robot, the Canadian robotic army goes out the gym to our transfer tray, out installed by the robot. Once it's installed and locked in the facility, we do some initial testing. Then, we open the experiment. So, it's about 19 inches long in a closed mode. Once we open the carrier, you have a 33-inch-long, 200 square inch exposed science surface. And, in that 200 inches, there's a mount deck and a swing deck. The mount deck is the side that stays down, and the swing deck is the top of the clamshell. That comes out and gets further exposed. So, if you could picture folding a piece of paper in half and you're holding it vertically, when you open the paper the rest of the way, that top piece of paper, that's that swing deck portion of it.  Host: You basically have to put it out the airlock folded so it fits out that way.  Wes Gordon: Yeah. Yeah.  Host: And then, once you get it out and you're about to install it on the facility, that's when you can unfold it.  Wes Gordon: Yeah, the, when we go into the gym area, like we're put onto an Alpha Space designed transfer tray.  Host: OK.  Wes Gordon: The [MISSE Transfer Tray] MTT, and we can carry up to eight carriers out there.  Host: Oh, wow.  Wes Gordon: Yeah, and eight of --  Host: And, three carriers per side.  Wes Gordon: Three carriers per side.  Host: OK.  Wes Gordon: So, we can take eight of them out there, and then install them and extract. And, they come back on the MTT as well. So, the full exchange activity happens by the robotic arm taking us out with the MTT. Then, we install and exchange and bring the units back. And, you know, that's one of the key pieces if we want to upgrade the avionics, even the avionics, the power and data box and the switch box, they're removable. We can upgrade. We can enhance. We can repair. The carriers, we swap them on a six-month to one-year cadence, right? They're removable, easily removable and extracted. And, that's the simplicity behind it for everybody else.  Host: So, for crew interaction, really the only thing they're doing is they're taking these carriers, these suitcases, and they're just loading it into the transfer tray and sending that out. The robotic work does all the installation onto the facility, taking the carriers off and on from the facility, taking them back in. Then, once they're back in the airlock, the crew is taking those suitcases and they're putting them away for eventual return to Earth.  Wes Gordon: Absolutely, sir.  Host: Minimal crew time.  Wes Gordon: It's minimum crew time.  Host: OK.  Wes Gordon: There's a, you know, the robotics team and the crew have done a beautiful job coordinating and handling our crew time to where our crew time interaction and robotics has a really good understanding of how this works and the interaction. We interact with them on a regular basis to make that a very optimized and a very smoothly flowing system and operation. So, it's a lot of coordination, you know, like you and I were talking before we started the show. You know, there's a lot of unsung heroes and a lot of collaborations that happen in the background, and definitely that robotics work is critical to the work we do. But, also, the key to the simplicity of what we do.  Host: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wes Gordon: We don't need the EVA. We don't need that work, right. We need the robotics to do that, and it's been designed as such.  Host: So, when we were talking about the history, you talked about MISSE as a materials experiment. It's since included a lot of other technologies and, I don't know, samples of whatever you want to put out on this facility. Let's go through some of them. What are some of the materials that you're testing, or the materials that you've tested in the past? What have we found out, and what are these other technologies?  Wes Gordon: So, we've done a lot of, like you said in the beginnings the materials work. We've done a lot of materials for different types of coating, new types of tapes, different types of fabrics, you know, what can we do. The space suit, for example, right. What can you expose that space suit to, and can we make a better fabric? Can we test a better fabric, right? What better way to test that fabric than to expose it to the environment? We've done some research and assisted with the research of lens coatings and protective coatings, right? What can survive and still be clear, right? What can you still see through and what survives? To be honest, we've had a few samples that just completely deteriorate, and that was because they just, that was the science, right? Is it designed to survive?  Host: The answer's no, and that was the investigation.  Wes Gordon: The answer's no, and that was the point of the investigation, right. You know, it's always exciting when you're seeing everything going on, and you're seeing these samples, and you get the pictures every month. And, customers are like, you know, this is amazing. This is, you know, these pictures are very helpful. This data's very useful, and that's always exciting. That's always positive because you're like, I'm doing something good, and I'm doing something rewarding for everybody. But, that's that material side. On the technology side, you know, that lone little company that has this new computer board that they want to fly in even a fighter, or they want to get it into the space program, that little shop can't set up doing what we do and afford to do that, right? So, we're able to go through and take their module or their new component, put it up there, apply power to it, pull data down, get them to a TRL-8, and prove that your unit is fine. It survives space. It survives the environment. It can handle the temperature swings. It handles the radiation. It handles all the things that space would do to that component in a raw, exposed form. Right.  Host: You talked about you want to get your clients to a TRL-8. Is that what it is? What's that?  Wes Gordon: That's the Technical Readiness Level. So, as you're going through your Technical Readiness Levels, you go from a one to an eight. An eight means I'm qualified for space. I'm ready to go.  Host: Oh.  Wes Gordon: And, there's varied interims in there, right? And, the best way to do that is pure exposure, rapidly. So, you could take yourself through the different TRLs by going, “I'm going to go into a thermal vac chamber, and I'm going to expose myself to the temperature swings in thermal. And, then I'm going to do it in a vacuum chamber, and then I'm going to try to expose it to this.” But cumulatively, what are those results, right? A lot of research time and a lot of lab time and a lot of testing time can happen where in our methodology, you know, we evaluate the materials and working with various groups on-site. And, like I said, there's a huge army of people behind this science, OK. From materials groups to the safety groups to the engineering directorate that we work with on a regular basis, but once we evaluated these samples, experiments are safe for flight, safe for use, properly contained, you give it to us, and within six months, you've answered all the questions. You have all the answers. What does temperature do? What does vacuum do? What does the radiation do? What does UV do? What does any of it, what is the contamination? Do you survive the contaminations or excess contamination? You get all those answers in a six-month period.  Host: That's it. So, is it ready to fly?  Wes Gordon: It's ready --  Host: You've tested it on MISSE, and MISSEs providing, what's happening here. Well, this is happening because we've gotten that data. Well, this is what's happening because we've gotten that data.  Wes Gordon: Yeah, and you know, when you're looking at the space program, what you want to do, you know, as NASA or other agencies, you want that high TRL, right. You want reassurance that if I pay you for this activity or this product that it survives, and it works in that environment. And, those small companies get that opportunity, and it's there, right? And, that's one of the wonders for that.  Host: So, some of the other technologies you were testing, you mentioned solar cells.  Wes Gordon: Yes.  Host: So, me as a regular person, I don't know too much about solar cells. I just think, “oh, there's a solar panel, and there it is.” What are you trying to figure out when it comes to solar cells? Maybe the power generation, maybe how it holds up in the vacuum of space. What is it about a solar cell you want to test?  Wes Gordon: It's really about getting direct access to the solar activity without any environmental impact or anything around you and testing. They test different geometries, different circuitry, different lens materials, different reflectivities. So, they have a whole gamut of activities that these folks are testing, and we test them from anywhere from government agencies to commercial agencies to schools that are evaluating these in conjunction with other activities. So, it's really good because there's a huge research base out there right now of how can you make a more efficient, more robust solar cell. Right? And, it's about not only the collecting of it, the reflectivity of it, how much of it can you reflect, at what angles can you reflect at. So, there's a lot of science that goes into that that they get direct UV activity and solar exposure right at zero beta, optimal readings, and we provide that.  Host: That's like almost industry level kind of data.  Wes Gordon: Yes.  Host: Improving the whole technology.  Wes Gordon: Yeah, and we're constantly evolving that. You know, we flew the original prototype version of that on MISSE 12. We enhanced it for MISSE 13. We're making another enhancement for 14. As we get better science, we get better as well, right? And so, once we understand the industry and we're learning more ourselves because this is a constant learning activity, right? Once they do science, they're like, you know, we need to see this or this, and then we adapt to learning what they're looking at. And so, industry, in a way, teaches us as we teach industry and provide data. And, that's the nice learning portion that I look forward to every day with my job, right? Every day is learning, right?  Host: Yeah.  Wes Gordon: It's one thing to build the circuit. It's one thing to build the control system and then collect the data but learning exactly what they're looking for. What are your expectations? What are you looking to see? That's where you need the army and the team because you can't understand every technology, but you can definitely reach into the NASA resources and in this community get better expectations and understandings of the, what are good, expected results.  Host: Nice. You mentioned circuit boards and electronics as being some of the things you were testing out there. What would be interesting about doing that in space?  Wes Gordon: It's really the survivability and exposure of a new circuit, new materials, new components. If somebody has a new type of integrated circuit, microprocessor that they want to test, will it survive? Did they make it out of good materials that would survive combined with the circuitry that they've built, right? That's a really good exposure. We have a couple of clients who believe they've created new versions with new materials of existing types of capacitors relays for switching purposes that they believe are out of the right materials and everything. So, they fly them up passively, study their materials, the material results. Then, we'll fly them again the next time, and if that's the right materials and everything in an active mode. So, they get, then, the switching or the current drawls or the voltage drops that they're looking for, right? And, at the cadence that we're flying at, they have that design and development window to where they can buy low cost passive space, understand the passive and the physical characteristics of their device. Then, very quickly and easily transition to an active state easily on the next flight. To --  Host: Theoretically, you're talking about a year of data.  Wes Gordon: Yeah. One-year development all the way through the process. And, that's, you know, that's huge reduction in data and science time because if you think about how long it would take for them to just evaluate the materials by going to the different labs and finding labs that could get them close but not exact results. Then, developing the active circuit. You can't test that in those environments, right? How else do you do that? And, that's what we provide.  Host: So, I heard a lot of examples, and we can even reiterate some of them of how testing these materials in space really helps to develop these technologies on Earth. I think there's, there are already applications, but even stuff one that I read was paint. I thought that was pretty interesting. I don't know how paint would -- sending paint in the vacuum of space would help you with a bucket of paint painting your home on Earth.  Wes Gordon: You know, there's, you have that UV exposure. You have those temperature adherences. You have harsh industrial environments that people are evaluating, and there's no harsher environment than direct space, right? But, also, you know, you've got to think about it in spaceflight and space travel. Everything's painted. Everything is painted. Right. I mean, we use a lot of stainless. We use a lot of steels. We use a lot of aluminums, magnesium, tungsten’s, we use a lot of surfaces that don't need to be painted but they're anodized or alodined. We do that a lot on space componentry and have for many, many, many years. But there are lots of companies also developing better coating, better painting processes, too, even for that survivability for painting of products, and you need that data. You need that science.  Host: So, it goes both ways, too. You're talking about Earth benefits. It's good in your bucket just for higher quality paint.  Wes Gordon: Yep.  Host: But, it's also good on a spacecraft.  Wes Gordon: Absolutely. Right.  Host: OK.  Wes Gordon: That's that evolution, and you get the answers like that.  Host: Very cool.  Wes Gordon: Real time.  Host: Alright. Say you're a client, and you're thinking this would, I really want to do this. I want to send up this little material, and I want to go up to space. What are, what do you expect the client to do? What do you expect them to do for you to help?  Wes Gordon: Actually, we've put a significant effort because this is what we do, into trying to simplify this process and make it really easy for our clients. So, when a client reaches out to us, when they've reached out to us and using Mark, currently Mark Shumbera who handles that on our Business Development side. When they reach out to him or a Principal Investigator at NASA, whoever this is, right. There's two ways. We get them from commercial activity or the Principal Investigators through the NASA side. And, DOD and AFRL, so lots of agencies with that. We send them a questionnaire, and this questionnaire goes through and asks all the questions that we would need to answer all the questions for them to aid with the design, certification, safety approval, readying them for flight. We take that information and we create a design document that allows us to design that and do all that work internally. And then, we create, then from there, once they agree that, yes, this I agree this is how I like how you've packaged it. I like how you're handling it, you know, all that information, then we start our entire process. And, you know, that's the complicated portion behind the scenes, but to simplify that, it's really, we do a design of your holder. That holder is then placed on a deck and that deck is what gets mounted into the MSC, the suitcase that we've been discussing.  Host: OK.  Wes Gordon: And so, that sample, the sample goes in a sample holder. Once the sample holder is designed, they're fit onto a deck. So, we design the deck to fit all the samples that we're trying to do. So, we do a lot of space planning, capacity planning, looking at how these things place, right?  Host: Yeah, your game of Tetris.  Wes Gordon: Exactly. It is. It's a game of Tetris because we're trying to maximize the number of samples that we can fly for that flight for everyone. So, we fit those pieces on. Then that deck is actually we have a thermal vac chamber at our facility. So, we're able to put them through the thermal vac capability. We expose them to that, and also the key to that is getting rid of the contaminations. Because as people handle things every day and things go around, people don't realize, but everything gets contaminated in some form or fashion.  Host: Which can lead to bad data.  Wes Gordon: Yes. So, we bake that off, and then we take that deck and we install it in a unit. And then, that unit goes to a series of environmental testing. I guess it's important to mention to everybody folks, too, that we do that in a 10k clean room. That's actually at our facility. So, we have a clean room in our facility, so we're always handling their materials with care, and then integrating them with care within that 10k clean room. So, we then expose them to environmental testing. If it's just a passive sample, it needs thermal cycling and it needs a vibration test. Because we've got to ensure that their material won't break and won't become a sharp edge or some other risk a safety factor on orbit, right? So, that's the first step with that. If it's an active experiment, we go through what's called [Electromagnetic Interference] EMI testing, and what EMI testing is this ensures that we don't induce any electronic noise to communication systems around the unit. For example, if we were transmitting, for some reason, at the same frequency as the astronaut's headset, that would be very unfavorable to everybody.  Host: Yeah.  Wes Gordon: Right. So, we have a series of tests that we go through to ensure that everyone understands what noise I'm creating in space if any, what those levels are, and if there's any impacts to systems around, the wireless system, headsets, you know, any of that, right. Because crew safety, critical, and when you're doing an EVA, criticality, right. So.  Host: Is a lot of that written by NASA and set to Alpha Space, say, “hey, whatever you do, make sure your samples aren't giving away this frequency because that's going to mess with our stuff.”  Wes Gordon: We actually test it here at JSC.  Host: Oh, OK.  Wes Gordon: So, what we do is once we've integrated the units, we bring them to the facility here, and there's an EMI lab, and we bring it actually to JSC and JSC in conjunction with us, we run the EMI test. They run that in a chamber over here right on-site, and so we go through. We bring our unit in. They connect the sensors and the filters. We power up our unit, and we know what the baseline noise levels are, and they see if we had any additional noise. Because, like I said, we're flying antennas, circuit cards. So, we have to ensure that we haven't added any additional noise that we're not aware of. And, that report, then NASA generates that report, and we'll either pass or fail. So, if we see failures during that, we have to make adjustments to our circuitry and our system, either our system or working with the client to try to reduce that noise so we're in the proper area and test through.  Host: Seems like there's a decent amount of work on the Alpha Space side where you already kind of have a good idea of what you, of what it takes to fly in space and you're helping those clients. But then, you have to pass almost like go through the gauntlet of NASA tests, like almost the flights certification, making sure that this thing is safe and ready to fly.  Wes Gordon: Yes, sir.  Host: OK.  Wes Gordon: And, that's, like I said, that was one of the key things I was mentioning early on is the value, right, the key thing that Alpha Space is making it easy for the customer. Once they deliver the sample, if nothing occurs, we don't have to do anything for them other than form a, you've been integrated. You've passed environmental testing. You've been sent for stowage. You're installed. Here's your data, right. So, I mean, you know, those are really simple, easy steps for our client with all those little things we talked about happening in the background. And, it is. It's a constant, you know, coordination, so you know, you really, it's an efficient process and repeatable process. Right. That's the key of understanding that portion.  Host: Now, that process, that's happening here locally in Houston, right, you're right down the street from us at the Johnson Space Center, but eventually, you got to fly. So, how does the stuff get from here in Houston over to where it's going to launch from?  Wes Gordon: So, we deliver everything to the cargo management contract.  Host: OK.  Wes Gordon: Which is local to us here, and so we deliver the product to them and they package it up and get it transported with the other items that are going from JSC over. And, they get to the launch vehicle, get installed in the launch vehicle, and then launch. And, the same occurs, there is coordination here for even on the return. We know when the returning vehicle is going to be coming back. When the returning vehicle's coming back within about two weeks, we get our carriers back.  Host: That was quick.  Wes Gordon: Well, because of the science we have, we can't keep exposing them, we don't want the additional exposure. We're trying to get that science back to our customers and it not being on the ground any longer than necessary. So, from when the vehicle detaches and returns home, to when the client has the samples is right around less than 30 days.  Host: Wow.  Wes Gordon: Because we have a tight window there of the return within seven to ten days of splashdown. And then, we have a ten day turn on the science to get it shipped back to the customer. And, we've worked with customers on that. We have, you know, I think that's the flexibility that you'd find with Alpha Space is that we do have some customers who actually come to our facility and directly integrate and directly de-integrate because they hand carry their samples. They take the samples directly from their lab. They bring them directly to us. We integrate them that day or a couple days, depending on what the samples are, and we schedule and coordinate with them to be available and return to de-integrate their samples and take those samples back with them and hand carry a return. So, we have that coordination as well, right. Just, it's tailored around the science as what, you know, what they're needing in terms of their handling and care and what needs to be done with their science.  Host: Yeah. I'm sure there is a significant amount of handling and care when it comes to investigating a sample that has now been returned from space and you're the one saying, \"Here you go.\" But I'm sure there's a lot that goes before that, before you finally say, \"Here you go.\"  Wes Gordon: Yeah, that's why we, like I was mentioning before. We had the questionnaire because one of the key things we ask in the questionnaire is are there any special handling instructions. And, special handling instructions in terms of delivery, installation, de-integration. You know, it may come to me in the mail and may get returned in a hand carry. Right. So, some sample may be complex and, in such case, where you need our integration capability and their engineering knowledge to do the install, right? So, that flexibility and that, that's interaction is what's critical to making that science a success.  Host: Well, tell me about right at this very moment, in fact, earlier today, I was listening to some of the flight loops, and they were, they had MISSE on their to do list. Actually, working with trays and doing that. So, tell me what's going on right now for MISSE.  Wes Gordon: Yeah, MISSE is actually an amazing place right now, actually. It really is. It's an amazing time to be a member of the Alpha Space team because we're actually in the process in March, we'll be removing seven carriers and installing five others. That'll be an exchange that happens, so they'll be taking care of that. So, when they return, we'll be going through that exact process we just talked about. But, at the same time, we're preparing for the next launch and the next delivery. We have a delivery due in the first week of August for NG14, which is launching in October, and so we're in the process right now of what I talked to you about. We already have the client questionnaires. We've already done the [Interface Definition Document] IDDs with them. We've done the sample deck layout. We're getting ready to start cutting the metals and doing everything to get ready for their samples. First part of May, we start receiving samples to integrate and start that testing cycle. So, we've got units returning end of April. In the same time, we're prepping for the next flight to go out in May. So, that's, you know, de-integration, rolling right into integration of the next flight, you know. It's a consistent rotation and process for everybody.  Host: Yeah, it's busy.  Wes Gordon: That's a six-month cadence, and it's rolling.  Host: And, you talked about a Northrop Grumman, going up on a Northrop Grumman mission.  Wes Gordon: Yes.  Host: So, we did talk about returning samples, but are there some samples that don't necessarily need to be returned to a customer? They have all the data that they need and so it gets put in the trash? Or, do they all come back?  Wes Gordon: No. They all come back.  Host: Oh, interesting.  Wes Gordon: So, we go up on an NG. We can go up on SpaceX or NG.  Host: OK.  Wes Gordon: Currently. There are, we've been assessed for other vehicles, but we currently go up on an NG or a SpaceX, and we return on SpaceX flights.  Host: Got it.  Wes Gordon: And, depending on what we're doing, our cadence is go up on an NG, return on a SpaceX, or because of the ease of installation, we can go up on a SpaceX. They remove us, install us, extract the other units and install them back in SpaceX during that flight mission while they're docked.  Host: Oh, wow.  Wes Gordon: So, they can do the full exchange, and that was the full transfer to MTT, bring them back in, get off of MTT, re-box, and put in SpaceX. So, it's done. The last two flights that I've been part of, I've been with Alpha Space a year now. But, the last two flights I've been part of have gone up and been returned on a SpaceX flight in that docked window. That's how fast that turnaround is in the, but that's huge coordination with robotics, huge coordination with the crew, right. Because SpaceX is going up. They've got to empty SpaceX. They've got to get me transferred. They've got to do an install, bring everything back, and --  Host: Yeah. It's kind of, it reminds me kind of like a logistics company.  Wes Gordon: Yeah.  Host: If the packages are coming and you're like, \"Go, go, go, go!\" And then, you have to do the, all these switches and then shove them back in and deliver them back.  Wes Gordon: Absolutely. You know, and that's why there was, you know, making a system that involved minimum crew time.  Host: Yeah.  Wes Gordon: It was critical, right. You know, you take it off the MTT, and you box it up and send it back home.  Host: Because anything can happen, right? Like, I'm sure you know the crew's busy. You can be shoving a bunch of spacewalks in there or other science experiments. Some things they're going to have their hands in like the glovebox, and you're like, \"Hey, we got to get these trays out.\"  Wes Gordon: Yeah, that's the huge coordination, you know.  Host: Yeah.  Wes Gordon: To give you an example of the coordination, you know, we're working, we've been working with robotics team already for the 13 transition, and we're preparing already starting next week for 14 which doesn't happen until October. But so, they have that timeline and that understanding, that evaluation.  Host: Wow.  Wes Gordon: It's making sure that coordination is set so they know. The nice feature of our system though is they know how long it takes to install. They know how long it takes to remove them. And so, they have that timeline, and they've worked that timeline now to where they have repeatability.  Host: Yeah. Having that precedence of having done it before.  Wes Gordon: Yeah.  Host: Makes it a little bit more predictable for the crew and easier to schedule.  Wes Gordon: Yes, sir.  Host: So, we talked about the genesis of MISSE being a materials experiment, and we've gone through a lot of different examples of different technologies and things that you can put on this facility to expose. What's coming up? What's the future for some of the things we can test outside?  Wes Gordon: You know, there's a couple of them. One of the bigger ones we're working on is understanding how to work with biology outside. You know, we've done materials. We can do componentry. We can do any number of physical devices, powered on power. What we've been approached with and the things we're looking at is how to handle biology outside of the station. It's a complicated process, but MISSE Provides a great platform. It's very flexible, and so, you know, I think that's going to be one of those next evolutions. Huge need for it in science. Huge exposure for it. But, I think even beyond that and sooner than that is one of the more, I think, exciting things we've been working on, too, is we're in the process of partnering with a company whose able to take our data that we generate in the LEO area and analytically predict what it's going to do in other orbits. What will this, given that we know this is how it reacts on Earth. Given that we know how it reacts in LEO, going to the Moon, they can analytically predict how it would respond going to that base using us as a calibration point.  Host: Oh, interesting.  Wes Gordon: And, we're working on that, and that's coming really soon for everybody. And, I think that's exciting, right, because we're providing you a platform now to understand and start evaluating the next step, right. You know, we've talked about the TRL previously.  Host: Yeah.  Wes Gordon: OK, well how do you TRL or approve yourself to be landing on the Moon, right? We're giving you a platform and analytics to try to get to that point. And, I think that's huge. Another evolution is we're actually in the process right now and significant team effort and investment with Alpha Space, and we're upgrading our avionics and our control systems to add more features for the clients. You know, the streaming will come, the better photos will come, better data management, more real time data management, faster data transmission, you know, enhancing reliability and, you know, we've learned a lot. Right. We have learned a lot, right, and we did. Alpha Space as a company did MISSE 9 and we're prepping for 14 right now.  Host: Alright.  Wes Gordon: Right. In that timeframe, we've learned a lot, and technology, technologies we've even tested have advanced a lot, right? And so, leveraging all that, creating a more robust system for everyone is what we're preparing in the background for everybody. You know, it's that unseen by the client but better for the client.  Host: Yeah. Because I'm -- the one that really stuck out to me was streaming. If you're able to have real time data and track your experiment in space over time, just imagine. I mean, because, you know, if, for a material, I'm sure you're providing a lot more data, but what I'm visualizing in my head is you send up a material, and you know how it was when it launched, and you know how it looked when it came back. I'm sure there's data in between, but to have that live, continuous data.  Wes Gordon: You know, monthly, they just get a picture.  Host: Oh, wow.  Wes Gordon: It's great, right. Every month, we give them a picture, so the facility, which I guess is a piece we didn't cover. Currently, when the facility opens, when you open up one of the MSCs, we have a camera trolley that goes down the whole deck, and every month, we take photos. So, they get a monthly photo, right? But, a lot of our experiments don't expect a lot of changes in a 30-day window. Right? But, if you need the streaming because you're expecting the possibility of something rapid happening or occurring, bio-experiments right, the bio-experiments. Things are going to happen. You want to see that happening. You want to see that interaction, right? We see that need coming. When we see that we're looking at those things, and it think that's, you know, that's your, the pinnacle of the next piece is the constant evolution to enhance the science and enhance the experiments.  Host: I could see that with the biology, that being so much more of a need to have that sort of monitoring because life is just. When we're talking biology, what, I mean, are you thinking like microbiology? Are you thinking, like, plant life? Are you thinking?  Wes Gordon: We're still evaluating a lot of that, working with folks on that, but we definitely see that evolution, and we're evaluating it very strongly, yeah.  Host: You talked about analytics to understand the difference between low-Earth orbit and seeing how that might apply to other environments like the Moon. Are you thinking about maybe sending stuff right to the Moon and using that analytic software to compare what you thought was going to happen versus what actually happens?  Wes Gordon: Actually, we've taken it a little step further. We actually have won a contract that we call rack internally, and we are actually sending a MISSE type activity to the Moon. We're part of one of the new lunar payloads.  Host: Wow.  Wes Gordon: So, Alpha Space was selected to perform that work as part of the new lunar payload work that's going on. So, we're working directly with everybody on the new lunar work to actually use our capabilities and what we've been doing for exactly that, the lunar work. Right. And so, that's an amazing piece, right? When you look at where Alpha Space is sitting, we have LEO. We are enabling analytics and a whole other level of analytics for everybody and we've been selected, and we are going to the Moon.  Host: Wow. What's -- for Alpha Space, for maybe some of your clients, what is interesting about the Moon? What do you want to test on there? Are we talking circuits? Are we talking materials?  Wes Gordon: It's open. It's an open platform, just like, right. That's the point, giving everyone access.  Host: Yeah.  Wes Gordon: And, we, you know, the market has to be evaluated, and we have to look at where the pieces are, but you know, we've been selected for a specific target and payload using our technology, and I think that's a key, huge first step. And, proving that technology and those steps, and you know as NASA evolves and does more with that, it's nice to know that we're part of that evolution and working with them to create that step and move ourselves forward and doing that. And, you know, it's quite an honor also at the same time for Alpha Space to be recognized for our capability of performing that work from what we've been doing with our facilities and our research for them to have the confidence in our product to be used as that device for the new lunar work.  Host: You say you've been at Alpha Space for a year. Were you in the space industry beforehand, or is this like a whole new world to you?  Wes Gordon: No, it's not a whole new world. I actually was, I've been in the space industry, well, I was weapons and defense relative to the space industry since the late '90s. Moved directly into the actual space program at JSC mid-2000s. At the end of shuttle, I did take a step out, and I went out, like several folks did, into the energies and oil and gas business to enhance some of my skillset, and I learned a lot about process optimization and the logistics and other things. But my true love was with the space program, and when I saw the opportunity at Alpha Space, I was given the opportunity to come back and play with this toy. You know. I mean, well, when you look at, I did, I did shuttle. I did station. I was a subsystem manager for several products on the space station and space shuttle. And, some of my gear even transferred from shuttle to station as swapped --  Host: Oh, cool.  Wes Gordon: And so, when you've done that, those things were fixed purpose. I had the laptops. I had the cameras. I had a radio. You know, they were fixed. But those were just assets and tools, right. That's what I had at that time in my life in the space program. What Alpha Space has afforded me is the opportunity to work with the science and the R&D, and the engineering, right? And, that is something that is priceless because we need to evolve. We need to grow, and you know, it goes all the way back to right, Miss Stephanie opening a woman owned and the first female owned facility in-orbit, right? Setting those firsts. Opening up new windows. I mean, she started that in the beginning by opening female owned facility. Boom. Now, we're doing science for everybody on a regular basis, every day and filling that hole that didn't really exist, right? Where was the gap prior to us? Who filled it between the engineering mind and the space certification? Those scientists and those folks.  Host: Wow. Well, Wes, I want to thank you for coming on. Your passion is extremely contagious for all of this, but what I think was really fascinating about MISSE as a facility, and we've gone over a lot of just the, you know, how it works and everything, but what really excites me is just the amount of stuff you can test. Like, that's a lot of data. That's a lot of materials. That's a lot of technologies. That's a lot of things being exposed to space, and that's good data for everyone. Because, ultimately, we're talking about the commercialization of space. I think Alpha Space is a great example of that. Your commercial company operating in space, bringing on clients, working with NASA. It's just, it's a great example of how this all works, and there's just so much data. Really exciting to be talking to you today, Wes, I really appreciate your time.  Wes Gordon: No, I appreciate your time, and you guys taking and giving us the opportunity to even talk about the facility. You know, it's exciting. It's there, and I hope the world sees everything that we're bringing for science and the community.  Host: Alright. Thanks, Wes.  Wes Gordon: Thank you.

        description: "Gary Jordan Host: Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 117, “Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer: The Science.” I'm Gary Jordan, I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts all to let you know what’s going on in the world of human spaceflight. Coming up very soon, this November, 2019, astronauts aboard the International Space Station are set to kick off a unique and difficult set of spacewalks to repair an experiment called the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. Sounds a lot like something straight out of a sci-fi, right? But it's very real and a very complicated piece of equipment. The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, or AMS, is looking at high energy particles and looking for evidence of antimatter and dark matter in the cosmos, which may reveal more about the formation of the universe. No big deal. Now with such a complicated particle physics experiment, comes some complicated spacewalks, very much on par with the Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Missions. We’ll have to do a podcast on that sometime. So to help bring to light the significance of this experiment and these spacewalks, we are going to dive deep into the story of the AMS and this repair, and break it into three parts -- the science, the spacewalks and the tools -- all with fascinating discussions with the experts that are working on repairing and upgrading the AMS. So today for part one of this three-part series, we are discussing the science of the AMS focusing on cosmology and astrophysics with Brandon Reddell. Reddell is an assistant program scientist in the International Space Station program, here, at the Johnson Space Center. He has a Ph.D. in physics specializing in high energy space physics. Most of his graduate work was focused on modeling high energy collisions, produced in accelerators on Earth, and at NASA, he spent over ten years testing and modeling spacecraft hardware and the human body for radiation effects. Here he also collaborates with one of the primary authors of the Galactic Cosmic Ray Model that NASA uses to predict astronaut health risks. As well as hardware reliability to improve model predictions for these deep space missions. The AMS is one such instrument providing data on cosmic ray species that are of interest in improving these NASA models. So let's get right into it. Astrophysics and Cosmology 101 and the science of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer with Dr. Brandon Reddell. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Brandon, thank you so much for coming on the Podcast today.  Brandon Redell: Well, thank you. It's a pleasure to be here and I'm looking forward to it.  Host: I am both excited and very nervous to talk about this today because we had talked a lot about human space flight, which is part of this story because it is an experiment on the space station, there's going to be some spacewalks to actually go fix it. But now we're getting into cosmology, we're getting to astrophysics, so I'm going to do my very best to try to ask very appropriate and relevant questions for you.  Brandon Redell: No, that's great. It's a very complex experiment and it covers a lot of fields, so I'll do my best to try to answer everything.  Host: Well, let's go right into it. I wanted to start by, kind of, setting the background of what it is exactly that the AMS is exploring, by giving kind of a 101. So let's go into cosmology and astrophysics. Tell us about the universe, Brandon.  Brandon Redell: Okay. Well, first of all, we know the universe is very big but we also know that it had a beginning, right? That's been pretty well confirmed, really in the last century. Edwin Hubble, you may have heard of, first measured redshift is which is sort of a measure of how everything's leaving, spreading away from us, right? At some velocity. So there's been a whole slew of other satellite measurements like of the cosmic microwave background and things like that that have confirmed this. There's no doubt that we know that it's expanding and if you just take one over the expansion rate you can sort of derive how old the universe is, and so we know we're about 14 billion years old. Now so the expansion rate is still under investigation, there's some variations in the numbers, but they're all indicating 13, 14 billion years old, something like that. And so what we do know too is we have a lot of theories, like from general relatively and things like that, that also point that there was an ultimate beginning that also fit the model and predict what the future of distribution of galaxies look like, you know, how the universe is spatially organized and things like that, and in the right elements that are in the universe. So we have really good models that help support that. And so we feel like we have a pretty good view of the universe.  Host: And that view, the thing you're talking about right now, is the big-bang theory?  Brandon Redell: Yeah, it's the big-bang theory, that's sort of the generic term, but there's actually several different models and we can talk about that now or later but--     Host: Let's go right into it, yeah.  Brandon Redell: So one of the big models is called the \"Lambda CDM Model,\" [Cold Dark Matter]. So Lambda is just a Greek letter, looks like an upside-down triangle, kind of, like an upside-down V basically. And it's really the value that refers to dark energy, OK? So the C D M part of Lambda, the CDM, is cold dark matter. So really this model is purely a mathematical model that's a fit to only using only six parameters that basically described the overall evolution of the universe today. And so what we use is there's something called the \"Baryon Density\" and we can talk about baryon's here in a little bit. These are all inputs, baryon density, dark matter density, the age of the universe, and there's a couple of other parameters, they're pretty complex. But with only just six parameters we can actually from right after The Big Bang, using the current laws of physics, this model will run and it'll predict basically the existence and the structure of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which we measure all the time. It also predicts the large scale of the universe. The distribution of galaxies, the abundance's of hydrogen and helium, which are the abundant elements in the universe and so forth. So we have a -- it matches a lot of what we observe, so it's probably the most successful model, but there are some shortcomings and there's some competitors, but that's predominately the major model used today. And it's sometimes it's often referred to as the \"Standard Model of Cosmology.\"  Host: Yeah. So basically what you're doing is you're looking at the universe and you're saying, here's all the things that exist, this cosmic microwave background, right? Something's that's -- it's like, what is it three, four, Kelvin?  Brandon Redell: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the current temperature.  Host: Yeah, it's just so it's fizzling in the background. So we're like, what made this, what made the galaxies the way they were and you -- this particular big-bang theory is a way of modeling that mathematically.  Brandon Redell: Right. And that's just one thing that it models, right? It successfully models, like, what's really important is the abundance of elements that were created initially in the Big Bang because once that's said, that determines how much mass you have in the universe and how much stars and galaxies you have, and so forth. So that's really an important feature as well.  Host: See, that's one thing that’s really it's fascinating to the point where I don't think anyone can really fully comprehend just, you know, when you're talking about stuff in the universe.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: How much stuff there is. You know, we're looking at our galaxy and we're like, wow, that is huge.  Brandon Redell: Right.  Host: That's full of billions of stars. And now we're figuring out that a lot of these stars, or maybe most of them, have planets. So it's just becoming so big just in one galaxy and then you find out, yeah, there's a few more galaxies.  Brandon Redell: Well, there's that, right? So the current estimates are there's billions of galaxies.  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: There's been some research done in the last year that if you look at smaller galaxies that are called \"dwarf galaxies\" so like the Milky Way Galaxy has several dwarf galaxies, like, we have the large and small Magellanic Clouds, but outside of that, they're so small that we can't even see. So most galaxies have maybe hundreds to thousands dwarf galaxies. So when you factor all that in, some of the estimates in this recent research estimate trillions of galaxies.  Host: Oh, see, now, don't do that to me. [laughter]  Brandon Redell: They're big numbers but not all galaxies are as life, as we know it, might not be suitable for life because there's a lot of instability and irregular and elliptical galaxies, and things like that. But nevertheless, there's a large amount of material. And one thing that's kind of interesting is when you actually look at all the galaxies and stars, when you talk about the total content of the universe, matter and energy, that's only about 5% of what we really see out there. So the rest of it is unknown, so we only know a lot about a small amount, right?  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: When you look at just as mass alone, the amount of stars and galaxies is approximately 15% of the universe, by mass. And this mysterious material of dark matter is another part of it for mass.  Host: It has to do with the way that you're modeling the predictions of the universe, right? So there's -- if you just do the calculations based on what you observe mass wise, it just -- it doesn't work out, there's this other thing that's helping out with the formation of the universe.  Brandon Redell: In a sense you could say that.  Host: OK.  Brandon Redell: Now, we know observationally, and we have indirect evidence of dark matter. I mean, we can look at the galaxies, the rotation curves. In fact, that's sort of how it was first determined, was that there had to be a lot more mass around galaxies to account for the rotation of stars around the out on the spiral arms and things like that. We also know the universe is expanding and that's related to this dark energy term. So these are all parameters that we can measure. Going back to this Lambda CDM model, those are all predicted based on these initial six inputs, and so we can compare that with what we measure as long as, you know, we know the model's predicting everything we see we have good reasons to believe that what that model predicts for these values are indeed close to what they are in reality.  Host: So what does that say about what we know about the formation of the universe? Like, what questions I guess what I'm leading to, is what questions do we have even with this model that we still need to answer?  Brandon Redell: Well, so – yeah, that's a great question. And so, again, this model sort of picks up at some small amount of time after the Big Bang, right? So we don't know obviously what was before the Big Bang, right? The current understanding when you look at the space time theorems that there was nothing, right? So that's really hard to comprehend.  Host: Oh, yeah.  Brandon Redell: That actually gets into the metaphysics and things like that. But once we have something started, there's a lot of uncertainty of what initially happened in that first ten to the minus 38th seconds or something like that, right? So one of the current theories is called \"Inflation\" so for approximately a ten to the minus thirty six seconds or so, the universe expanded twenty orders of magnitude. We don't know how to model that, but we do have some evidence that that actually occurred. So that part of the model has not been sorted out as far as modeling that Initial Inflationary epoch of time, so that needs to be incorporated. And then on top of that, you might have heard of this term called \"Quantum Gravity\" we don't know how gravity works at the quantum level. And so our understanding of physics and recombining all these forces back at that earlier time, that's sort of a -- that's current modern research in particle physics and its astrophysics, cosmology, it sort of all blended together at that point. But there's a lot of understanding of the physics going on at the smallest times scales right at the beginning of the universe.  Host: So naturally, and this can sort of lead into our discussion about AMS, is based on these models of how we think the universe is created and what we would like to understand, what are things that we can look for that would provide the evidence?  Brandon Redell: Right. And so -- yeah, that's exactly right. AMS is looking for antimatter and I can talk about that here in a second.  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: Dark matter and just cosmic rays in general. One of the big questions is -- and this is perplexed astrophysicists, cosmologists for decades now is when we look out at everything, why is there only matter and no antimatter? Because these initial models, like Lambda CDM, they actually predict we should have a 50/50 mix of antimatter and matter. Antimatter is simply it's the same thing as matter but it has the opposite charge, if you think of a proton as a plus charge to it, an antiproton is the same mass but it has a negative charge and it also has some different quantum numbers that kind of determine the spin and angular momentum and things like that. But effectively, it's the same particles with negative charge. And so AMS is looking at signs from antimatter to try to understand, is there any original antimatter out there from the creation of the universe or maybe is it there's some theories that talk about dark matter either decaying or annihilating each other that could produce antimatter. So that's sort of why it's designed and located in space, is to make these measurements to try the help sort that out. And at the same time a lot of these things, as they travel from distant parts of our universe, our galaxy, to Earth, they become high energy and they're just high energy particles moving and we call those cosmic rays. And so those have direct application in bearing on success for human space flight as well.   Host: OK. So I want to go through. So you talked about what it's looking for, you said antimatter is one of them because there should be antimatter, so where is it? The other part was did you say dark matter? Was it what it's looking for?  Brandon Redell: Yes, dark matter.  Host: So how do you -- what's going on there? How could we look for that?  Brandon Redell: OK. So for dark matter?  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: OK. So dark matter, so we know observationally, like we mentioned earlier, we definitely know that there's a lot of mass sitting out there around galaxies, for instance, in between a lot of the voids in space. The Lambda CDM model actually predicts 26% of the mass energy content of our universe is dark matter.  Host: Wow.  Brandon Redell: And so that's in conjunction with predicting everything else in the universe. So we know there's probably a significant amount of it, and most importantly, we can actually observe it. Also through gravitational lensing, we know that there's got to be additional mass out there. And that's light bending around other galaxies when we're looking out in the distance.  Host: You're measuring how much light is bending essentially?  Brandon Redell: Well, you're looking at objects behind more massive objects, and so the light kind of gets bend around them and so you might see maybe two images because the light kind of gets split and you're seeing -- it looks like two different angles, but it's really being bent around a large massive objective. And so we know, just looking at the normal matter there, that there's got to be more mass to bend that light because we know general relatively pretty well. In fact, it's probably the most accurate or the most well tested of the physics theories. I think we know it out to an accuracy of 15 or 16 decimal places.  Host: And what's that, general relatively?  Brandon Redell: Yeah, the general -- Einstein's theory of general relatively.  Host: Which says space and time, is that the one or is it something else?  Brandon Redell: Yeah, yeah, yeah it's related it's-- you know, defined by a very complex math but in effect really what it's saying is it's another form of gravity, but it basically tells you that mass warps the space around it and it's that warping of the space that controls how that mass moves in there.  Host: I see.  Brandon Redell: So it's very interlocked. It'll make you think a little crazy if you think about it too much, but it's very -- mass and gravity are effectively, you know, related.  Host: OK.  Brandon Redell: To that. So dark matter, we're trying to measure that because nobody knows physically what's it consist of, right? We know indirectly it exists, but we don't know what particles it's made of. And so there's some theories out there that don't have any direct scientific evidence, but mathematically, if you extend the standard model of physics, which predicts all the right particles out there, there's various forms of that that lead to prediction of these exotic particles. Things called \"WIMPs, axions\".  Host: Cool.  Brandon Redell: Things like that. A WIMP is a Weekly Interacting Massive Particle that's just an acronym because it's called dark matter, it's dark, it doesn't give off or interact with light. So that it's really hard to see, it's hard to probe it and test for it and so that's why we can't measure it. But the idea is if these -- if this dark matter consisted of these other particles, it can interact with itself and create secondary particles that we know about and maybe can detect. And so that's what we're looking for, detecting these secondary interactions that indicate, you know, some other type of particle that's theorized right now.  Host: OK. Yeah. And this is along the lines of things we can look at to, sort of, help us give that evidence of how the universe forms, we talked about antimatter, we talked about dark matter. The other one you mentioned was cosmic rays?  Brandon Redell: Yeah. Cosmic rays, yes.  Host: So what's that one?  Brandon Redell: So if you think -- so I said the universe was about let's say 14 billion years old, the first generation of stars, they're actually called \"generation three stars\" in galaxies they kind of formed a couple hundred -- when the universe was a couple hundred million years old. From that time forward, there's been generations of stars in galaxies that have gone through these lifecycles and processes. And so for massive stars, one of their end states is they swell up and then they get so big and then gravity pulls them back down when they exhaust their fuel and they explode as a super nova. And so a lot of the cosmic rays, are just -- if you think about the periodic table of elements from hydrogen all the way up to iron, they're just the nuclei, no electrons around them, just the nuclei's zipping through space at relativistic speeds. As they travel, they interact with magnetic fields and they get accelerated. So they're moving very fast, you know, the speed of light and they're all over, they come from every possible direction at random angles and they're floating around the universe everywhere.  Host: Wow. So they're high energy, are they heavier particles too?  Brandon Redell: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So like a proton has -- it's just a proton with an electron around it. You go to helium, you have two protons and two neutrons, right? So as you go up the periodic table of elements, all the way up to iron which has 26 protons and 56 nuclei protons and neutrons. So, yeah, the higher you go up in the periodic table, the bigger the nucleolus is and therefore, the more damage they could cause too.  Host: OK. Now, there's something else here that it might be a separate topic or it might be along the lines of stuff that we can look for are \"quarks\" are they intermingled in this in anyway?  Brandon Redell: So quarks, yeah, they're -- they play a role in this.  Host: OK.  Brandon Redell: But they don't exist by themselves. Quarks, they basically the only way we really can see those is through -- like, currently, if you look at, like, particle gliders like at CERN, right? It uses very high energy interactions. So it accelerates, let's say, two protons near the speed of light and collide them and then for a brief amount of time you, sort of, break it up into its parts, and we can talk about that in a minute. But a proton's made up of three different quarks. So for baryonic matter, which is another name for saying all the matter that we see and that you and I are made up of and all the stars and everything, pretty much made up of quarks and there's six different flavors of quarks. But this strong nuclear force sort of binds them together and so it's so strong that you really can't separate them for that long without them recombining or interacting some other way. So they don't exist by themselves, but you can infer things about quarks based on studying these other particles.  Host: I see. So that's where they come in, by studying the other particles?  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: OK. OK. So now, I think we set a nice base for cosmology and astrophysics. We have this idea of how we think the universe formed and we're looking at these things to help us give evidence of that. So now let's go to the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer.  Brandon Redell: OK.  Host: What is this thing and how it is helping to answer those questions?  Brandon Redell: OK. So I like to think of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer Version 2, which is on space station, as basically a particle physics experiment that you might see at CERN [Center European Research Nuclear, Geneva, Switzerland] somewhere. But instead of being at CERN, it's mounted on the trust of the space station, right? So it's unique in the sense that it is a modern physics particle detector, a very complex one out in space, right? On the space station. And so what it -- and we can talk more about the hardware if you want but it basically has six, seven different type of detector systems to help you measure all the parameters that you need to help sort out these big questions about antimatter, dark matter, and cosmic rays, right? Like as far as measuring the charge of these particles, the masses, and if it's antimatter versus matter.  Host: OK. So it is -- the position in space has a certain benefit to it.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: In terms of finding where these particles come from.  Brandon Redell: Yeah. OK.  So yeah, that's a good point.  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: So being up on space station where we're above most of the Earth's atmosphere, if we weren't, if we're down on, let's say, on the surface, you have this column of atmosphere above us. And most of the cosmic rays interact with the oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere and they break apart, and so you really don't get a direct measurement of the primary cosmic rays. So we're above most of that and so we have a direct path of measuring those primary particles and then we also have the infrastructure on space station with power and data and so forth that helps make it possible.  Host: OK. So you mentioned going into the hardware of AMS, like what --  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: -- is inside of it that actually helps to -- so how's that work?  Brandon Redell: Okay. So basically there's -- AMS, so the A M in the AMS is magnetic, Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. So basically it has this large magnet in the center that's approximately three thousand times the strength of the Earth's magnetic field, so that sounds like a lot.  Host: Wow.  Brandon Redell: But it's over -- let's say, about a meter or so in space, right? Whereas, Earths field's around the planet, right? So it has more bending power. But nevertheless, that's a very powerful magnet to be in space, and so what we do as these charged particles zipping along in space, when they come near a magnetic field, they like to spiral around magnetic field lines. And so the direction they spiral, tells you the charge, right? If it's a positive charge, it'll spiral in one direction, if it's negative, it'll go the other. So the purpose of the magnetic field is just strictly to get particles to bend it a little bit. And so all of the material around that magnet is six or seven different detectors, let's say. So there's silicon trackers that basically measure the trajectory and that's how we can get the curvature so we know which way it's a parameter when you know to help based on the magnetic field strength, to get the charge and the momentum of the particle, which is related to its energy.  Brandon Redell: OK.  Host: There's transition detectors that help distinguish protons and electrons versus really just between protons and electrons. As it comes in, it transverses many layers of materials, you get different X-rays that are created from, let's say, the electrons that don't get generated by protons, so we can distinguish between those two types of particles. There's something called \"Time of Flight Counters\" that use energy lost to basically help understand the charge of the cosmic rays. Also, it helps on timing the events because we need to count the ones that enter in one side and travel out the other side, not coming in through the side of it. So as it trans you know, basically, when it goes through one end of it, it kind of starts it kind of resets all the other detectors. It says okay start counting at this point so it can measure all the right parameters and tie it to the same event. And then there's something called \"Anti coincidence detectors\" to help roll out particles coming in from the side because you don't want to count those if you don't have the full -- having the particle interact with all the detectors where you could set all the full information, you're only going to get a subset of information and that could be erogenous on some of the data analysis. And then there's something called a rich -- it's called, \"RICH\" it stands for the Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detector. So when particles move faster than the speed of light inside a material, they admit a light cone, it's a well-known, it's called the Cherenkov Effect. And so the size of that cone tells you a lot about the velocity of that particle, so that helps really measure the velocity. And then finally there's a thing called the \"E Cal\" it's an electromagnetic calorimeter and it's just a bunch of material. And so when a proton type particle comes in versus an electron, it has a different type of particle shower. So it can basically distinguish electrons and positrons separately from protons and heavier nuclei, like helium and stuff. So between all these six detectors, we're basically measuring the charge, the mass, the momentum or energy. And so you build up this -- you just collect particles over time to build up statistics so that you can get more accurate answers to understanding, you know, the distribution of particles that are coming in.  Host: So it's more collecting information about what's happening to the particles as they pass through, based on how they react with the magnetic field?  Brandon Redell: Right, right. Exactly.  Host: Yeah. OK.  Brandon Redell: The magnetic field, it's all about the magnetic field.  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: So and that's related to the AMS EVA's. The magnetic field causes the particle to go through the silicon trackers. And so that's really key to understanding if it's matter versus antimatter because if it curves one way or the other. We need to be able to measure that, and if you can't measure that there's no way -- you can't tell.  Host: Oh.  Brandon Redell: So that's sort of why the reason for the EVA's to repair some equipment on that.  Host: I see.  Brandon Redell: And we can talk about that in a minute. But ultimately, it's a very complex system, it has a lot of computers in it, a lot of data channels and but it's all about counting particles, counting particles, their energy and their charge, basically, and mass.  Host: Yeah, just a massive collection of data.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: Because, like you said, there's particles flying everywhere.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: Space happens to be a great place to do it and it's measuring the way they're interacting. That's interesting. I did have a clarification point because this part is just kind of rattling around in my brain, you said when positively charged particles go through the magnetic field they spin one way.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: And when negatively charged, they spin the other way.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: Now, what's the difference between antimatter?  Brandon Redell: So, antimatter's, it's the same thing as matter but it has the opposite charge.  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: So for instance, the positron is the antimatter equivalent of an electron. So electron, as we all learn in high school chemistry, has a negative charge, right? E with a minus sign. Well, positron is the exact same mass, 9.1 times 10 and minus 31 kilograms, but it has a plus charge. So there's this fundamental physics theorem called the \"Lorentz force\" and it has to do with a charged particle moving in the presence of a magnetic field. And so there's a force that causes the beginning of the bend. So a positive charge, when you do the math, it'll tell you, let's say, go clockwise, if it's traveling a certain direction around the magnetic field. The opposite charge, the math, the force bends it the opposite direction and it's strictly because of the minus sign difference.  Host: I see.  Brandon Redell: It's really I mean, mathematically, it's just the difference of a sign but that's -- it's been verified since Isaac Newton's time, probably, right?  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: Probably not that far back, but they didn't know about electrons and stuff back then. But it's really well known.  Host: So a proton has a positive charge too --  Brandon Redell: Yeah, proton's positive.  Host: -- but it's just basically the way that an electron would interact and the way a proton would interact are different they would just spin opposite because they're antimatter?  Brandon Redell: Yeah. The direction well, OK, a proton is not antimatter, but a positron is.  Host: That's what I'm saying is that, like, the way a proton goes through and it has a positive charge, it spins like a positive charge but it interacts with the magnet because it's a proton, it's not a positron, right?  Brandon Redell: Right.  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: So all charged particles will spin one way or the other.  Host: Right.  Brandon Redell: So if it's positive, let's say for the sake of the argument, based on the configuration of the magnetic field, like, what directions they're pointing in. All positives will go one direction, all negatives will bend the other way.  Host: Yes.  Brandon Redell: And so whether its so all you know from that is just really is it plus or minus? So you need other instruments to tell you what the mass is. Now, this silicon tracker may whole because you're recording the trajectories it goes through. So a proton's about a thousand times heavier than electrons. So it's harder, it can't, you know, depending on the energy, right? It's going to have a slightly different curvature than that. So there's some information gain from that but that's where these other detectors come in to help you sort that out.  Host: Got it. OK. So that's different. I was thinking positive charge but they're just different so that does make sense.  Brandon Redell: I would like to -- can I go back and say one thing?  Host: Yeah. Please do.  Brandon Redell: So since you were talking about antimatter and matter, so that's one of the outstanding questions in all of the physics. You know, like we said earlier, about it should have been about a 50/50 mix, there's actually some research out there, based on theory, that says shortly after the beginning of the universe, the amount of positive matter was just barely above the count for negative matter. So, like, I think the number's about ten billion, so for every ten billion antimatter particles, there's ten billion in one. So it's just the slightest imbalance. The current theory is that all this matter, antimatter annihilated each other and that's why it's gone. And then you had the small residual positive matter that ultimately led to, you know, having a positive matter dominating the universe. So that's why it's really important to try to understand is there any original antimatter left over because we could have antimatter galaxies or gas clouds out in space or stars made out of antimatter. Theoretically, it's possible, especially if it wasn't all used up or interacted early in the universe, so that's sort of what the AMS is looking for. And it's hard to distinguish between, is it the original antimatter or is it antimatter created because of dark matter interacting with itself? And so that's what it's trying the sort out. It's possible to measure antimatter but where is it coming from? That's big question.  Host: OK. Yeah. This is super complicated.  Brandon Redell: Oh, yeah. There's a lot.  Host: So speaking of complicated, going to how the AMS works, I know you said this was the second iteration that we're going to be working on the space station, there was one I believe to just make sure that this technology works in space.  Brandon Redell: Right.  Host: So that was actually even before space station.  Brandon Redell: Yeah, yeah, that flew on the space shuttle back in--  Host: '98.  Brandon Redell: Yeah, 98.  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: And so that was called AMS-01 and it was, you know, so most shuttle missions were pretty short, like less than weeks. I think this one flew for ten or eleven days, I believe. And it was very similar, maybe not quite as complex, but it was sort of a pathfinder to prove out this technology. And in fact, I believe there's been six or seven papers that came out of that work, even though it was active for maybe ten days or so, it collected enough information to make some statistically relevant observations. And it sort of -- one of its primary claims that it made was that a lot of people still quote and we're trying to verify now is sort of an upper limit to this helium, anti-helium ratio. So anti-helium is just another antiparticle, right? So helium, which has two protons, two neutrons but it has a negative charge. So AMS has the ability to distinguish between the two. And so a lot of people think if it can measure so protons are the most abundant elements and then helium's the second most. So the protons interact a lot with other materials. So you have -- let's say more noise, a lot of other things to consider, whereas, the helium's probably a cleaner signal. And so it's really important to try to measure the helium component to get let's say, a more accurate understanding of what the origin of dark matter. So that was an important find and then the AMS-02 detector is designed to try to probe a little bit -- the same number, right? But with more accuracy.  Host: OK. So yeah, let's go into AMS-02. It looked at this helium, anti-helium and then actually proved that that technology works. Now the AMS-02, it's a very complicated piece of equipment and it took a long time to get up there, especially because of several delays too.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: Like that's even Columbia I think had it.  Brandon Redell: Yeah, so there was -- yeah, you know, I think there was probably delays even on the ground because it's such a complex experiment.  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: It's a typical experiment you might see at CERN. It involves what? Sixty different institutions as of now, that number can change a little bit, but sixteen different countries. So, like I said we had, I think six different detector systems or so. So there's a lot of hardware and so there's a lot of integration involved and a lot of different individual things that have to come together at once, plus combining with typical, putting hardware up in space schedules, things like that. So that made it difficult but it did make it up on Shuttle Discovery in '98. And like I said, I think it was a ten day mission or so.  Host: I was thinking about AMS-02 though, AMS-02.  Brandon Redell: Oh, the AMS-02?  Host: Yeah, AMS-02.  Brandon Redell: Yeah, so it's the same thing. It flew up on STS-134 in 2011, I believe. And yeah, I mean, I think the collaboration after AMS grew, the sixty number I was mentioning, I think that's really AMS-02.  Host: Yeah. Yeah.  Brandon Redell: So it grew after that once it was proved successful and plus it had extra hardware added to it too to help with the measurements. So it's a big integrated effort because, not only is it massive, you need the space shuttle to take it up. It's an external payload, and that's on the outside of the space station, you have the power data connection you had to use ISS communication, the high bandwidth we have, to transmit all that data down and you have a ground station. So there's a lot of working with that that sort of played in setting up all that and -- to help, you know, get that infrastructure in.  Host: Yeah, that's a huge part of the story. I know it was difficult to get up there, you know, you said there was this big collaboration to make AMS-02 this possibility, but, you know, it needed to go to the space station because of how complex it is and you said it's observing so many particles. The space station had an abundance of power and a great system to transmit data that can actually make this thing work in space and I was think one -- maybe the only place that it--  Brandon Redell: Yeah. Right now it's the only place like this, right?  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: I mean, it's a National Laboratory, it’s in orbit up there, couple of hundred kilometers up and it's the only place right now that we could have the infrastructure to do these sorts of things so.  Host: OK. So that's a big part of the story. I did want to take this time though to plug -- and I'll plug it at the end too, there's this great documentary, I don't know if you've seen it. It was actually produced at NASA, here, but it's called \"AMS: The Fight for Flight\". And it's a whole story --  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: -- from AMS-02 to the ground--   Brandon Redell: Yup.  Host: Fighting its way, and then finally getting up to the space station in 134.  Brandon Redell: Yeah, no. I've seen that, that is --  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: I would recommend that too.  Host: Oh, yeah. So that's a great snap shot of the history of AMS. So let's get into what's happening and fixing it. So what is -- what's going on with the AMS that we need to fix it right now?  Brandon Redell: I think, you know, so the AMS originally I think had a three year design life and so we're well passed that, right? It started, I think, what? I think it became operational in 2011, shortly after it was installed. So we're well passed that design life it has, you know, like a lot of satellites and major pieces of hardware, you to want built redundant systems. And so it has these four cooling pumps to help circulate liquid carbon dioxide through the various detector systems to help radiate absorb the heat and then radiate it off into space, right? To help keep the instrumentation cool. The reason why we need to do that is we're measuring these individual particle impacts that are very -- each one by itself is a small amount of energy, but the electronics is very sensitive to temperature, right? If you have very warm electronics you're going to have a lot of electrons bouncing around and it's just noise and it's hard to distinguish between the noise and the actual signals, so if you cool it down you minimize the electron noise. And so that's the purpose of the pumps and I think three of them have pretty much failed and we're on the last one. So the experiment was never designed to, sort of, be fixed in space, so there's been a lot of planning for that. But the idea is to go up there, remove the old system, put up a new pump system and extend the life, and I think the numbers I've seen is that we can extend it probably for the rest of the life of the station since all the other detectors seem to be operating really nice, it's just a matter of getting the cooling pumps. I mean, it's still working now but, you know, we don't have any more redundancy, so if we can those up there and working that'll guarantee more signs.  Host: That's awesome. Now, you as a physicist, I'm sure -- I mean, you're here now talking about this because you're interested in this, why is it important -- why is the AMS important for this discovery?  Brandon Redell: Well, it's important because, you know, we all have the big question of about life, the origin of life, the lower origin of the universe, there's a lot we don't know so ultimately this is answering these big questions. So there's actually multiple fronts. There's a curiosity point, you know, for me I like to add, but in my day to day job I've done a lot of work in the past with cosmic rays and so we're actually gathering a lot of information on cosmic rays. And so NASA's main goal right now is to eventually spend more time out in space, right? Let's say at the Moon and eventually go to Mars, right? So that means more time, radiation's a big problem. So the better we can characterize the radiation and learn how to work in those environments makes a big difference, and so I'm always interested to get more data in that because I enjoy some of the modeling we've done to create that because there's a lot of physics and science involved in that. So I would say just in conjunction with that and just answering fundamental questions about the universe, if we actually find out what if dark matter is and how that plays into cosmological models, you know, that can reveal some information about unknown energy sources that we can maybe tap into also to help for the benefit of humanity. So there's a lot of very futuristic, kind of, goals that come out of this, but it ultimately leads to greater understanding and opening up the gateways for us to explore space.  Host: Yeah, there's multiple different physics disciplines I think that this will help with.  Brandon Redell: Definitely.  Host: And you specifically, you've done a lot of -- you even mentioned, a lot of research on cosmic rays.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: And like you said, the effects on the human body.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: You know, what are some of the things that you studied in terms of how cosmic rays affect the body?  Brandon Redell: Yeah, well, so I didn't necessarily look at the biological damage.  Host: I see.  Brandon Redell: But there's a whole suite of scientist here at the Space and Live Scientist Group that does a lot of that work. We do know radiation's bad, right? There's two types of effects, there's some called \"acute effects\" which are short term high dose, like we've all seen the movies when, you know, when bombs go off or whatever and there's a lot of radiation, people can die from that, right? So that's a big problem because when we travel to Mars there's bursts from the sun that are high -- could be potentially high sources of radiation. So there's ways to partially shield some of that, so that's always an active experiment or understanding of engineering problem, right? Just how can we maybe avoid shield some of that or what. Using magnetic field is possibly one way to do it, at least the shield part of it but these things, these cosmos rays are very high energy, so we may never fully be able to shield them 100% but understanding the --how the body tries to repair itself on certain kinds of radiation is an active area of research. One of the bigger things that we're trying to protect most our astronauts from right now is the risk of getting cancers from exposures, right? So we're trying to minimize their risk. They're categorized as radiation workers, just like nuclear power plant workers are, slightly different limits to be contusive for space work. But so that's stuff's carefully monitored and practiced when they select crews and so forth, so that's always a consideration. My particular area that I was really focused in on is a lot of people don't know radiation is really bad for electronics. So as opposed to a dose, which is an accumulation of a lot of particles, you can actually have a single particle come in and take out your main processor and your flight computer and you can lose your computer, right? And lose control of the vehicle for it, you know? So there's a lot of engineering designs and so we've designed the Orion vehicles quite hardened to radiation, so that that's been a consideration. And just about any satellite that goes off beyond Low Earth orbit or let's say geosynchronous orbit and beyond, have to consider these things.  Host: Yeah. That's actually -- we had an episode on that.  Brandon Redell: OK. Yeah.  Host: We had an episode on how Orion has radiation hardened.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: And like you said, it could take out computer systems. So the way, you know, understanding how cosmic rays effect that, what they ended up doing is build redundancies.  Brandon Redell: Yeah, and that costs money.  Host: Sure.  Brandon Redell: But in space, in real estate, right? And mass. So you have to figure all these things out. So it's an integrated problem but ultimately it's a reliability problem too. And just one other thing that people might not know is just like radiation doesn't necessarily mean you're going to die if you get an exposure to your body. The analogy for electronics is it doesn't always break parts it can just change your data.  Host: Oh.  Brandon Redell: That's the more dangerous stuff. Is when it flips your data around, how do you handle that? So you have to have smart software and things like that.  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: So those are all similar things, but radiation in general is one of the bigger risks to a long duration space flight that's still being worked on the human level and to a lesser degree, probably on the electronic side.  Host: Wow. OK.  Brandon Redell: But it's nevertheless, drivers for designs and things like that.  Host: Yeah. So AMS is helping us to understand, kind of, the formation of the universe, but then understand more about these particles and how they may interact with stuff.  Brandon Redell: Well, yeah. It’s so we're learning, you know, we're basically accounting them, right? So we're understanding the distribution of the types of particles and improving our ground base models that let us predict what the fluxes of these particles are, let's say at the Mars orbit or something, right? So when we do -- when we plan flights we try to predict ahead of time what the radiation levels are going to be depending on the length of the mission and the solar cycle, all these things, right? So the AMS data is helping us improve these models.  Host: That's awesome. So, you know, AMS is on the space station, we're coming up on some spacewalks that are helping to fix this piece of equipment well, I guess, like you said, not necessarily fix but just add the redundancies and extent life because some of those cooling pumps have failed, so just adding those. But, you know, we're dedicating human space flight to this effort, you know, we have people going out and fix and what we learn from it can be used for future human space flight. So, you know, you being a physicist, why is it important to explore with humans?  Brandon Redell: Well, you know, this is a question that has answers, pros and cons both ways, right? I think most people probably would consider robotic maybe as a pathfinder for humans. Obviously, sending humans is a risk, right? So there's always that risk that we have to weigh for. But some of the advantages for human space flight, I would say, you know, humans can have -- make quick decisions when need to be. I remember when Apollo 17 astronauts talking about their mission, looking at the geology on the Moon and so forth, you know? So in the course of eight hours I think they covered twenty two miles of surface. Well, if you look at Mars Opportunity Rover, it took eight years to cover that same area. So functionally, I mean, I think humans because you can make the decisions to cover more territory, might be a little bit more efficient once the, let's say, they establish, an infrastructure's established. And also humans maybe can deploy certain things if we're looking at, let's say, drilling for In Situ Resource Utilization, that's a hard thing to do with satellites -- I mean, with robotics controlled through satellites, and so forth. So I think there's some advantages to have humans doing some of that work. Certainly, if we're going to have a human presence somewhere, maybe for scouting out territories or things like that, that might be better off for robotic type missions. But I think in the end because we want a human presence, we have to prepare to get us used to working in these environments and so forth, so there's that part of it too. So I think they both have their uses, it's just really what phase in the exploration we're in. Also, some of the robotic missions can go to hostile environments that we can't do with humans, so that's the advantage probably for robotics as well.  Host: Yeah. And we get a lot of the same answers but I just love asking that question.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: Because we're in the business of human space life. So just I think, you know, one of the biggest things that I appreciate definitely is the inspiration value. I mean, you’re not going to get someone too attached to a robot but you can see them really, really feeling like the same feelings with a person.  Brandon Redell: Yeah.  Host: Going to explore.  Brandon Redell: Yeah. And I would say -- I would just add, like, if we're just strictly talking -- if I'm only interested if particle physics, I don't need a human to do that right? We can build a detector and send it somewhere.  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: And that's just as good from that perspective.  Host: You don't want a person grabbing particles as they go through?  Brandon Redell: Well, it's just unnecessary really. But I think overall, in the category of human space exploration, you have to have humans involved, right?  Host: Yeah.  Brandon Redell: And there's efficient reasons why to do that.  Host: Yeah. Well, Brandon Reddell thank you so much for coming on and taking us through this history of astrophysics, cosmology and AMS, all fascinating stuff. I think I stayed in step with you, I think.  Brandon Redell: Well.  Host: But if not, we'll have you on again because I can talk about this I think all day.  Brandon Redell: Oh, great.  Host: It's just so fascinating.

AND I KNOW WE WERE TALKING A LITTLE BIT JUST HERE IN THE BEGINNING JUST ABOUT NOAA AND NASA AND THOSE DIFFERENT LAYERS, BUT SO THE PART THAT YOU’RE IN, THE SPECIFIC PART, IS CALLED THE SPACEFLIGHT METEOROLOGY GROUP, RIGHT? >> THAT’S CORRECT. >> OKAY. SO WHAT DO THEY DO? >> WELL, LARGELY, ANYTHING INVOLVED WITH THE MANNED SPACEFLIGHT PROGRAM, THE OPERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. LAUNCHES ARE USUALLY HANDLED FROM 45TH WEATHER SQUADRON, TYPICALLY OUT AT KENNEDY SPACE CENTER-- THE AIR FORCE HANDLES THE LAUNCH WEATHER. >> OKAY. >> SO ANYTHING INVOLVING THE LANDING WEATHER IN MANNED SPACEFLIGHT THAT’S CONTROLLED BY THE MISSION CONTROL CENTER HERE AT JSC, SPACEFLIGHT METEOROLOGY GROUP GETS INVOLVED WITH THAT. >> OKAY. >> LARGELY IT’S LANDING WEATHER, AND SOME EARTH OBSERVATION STUFF WHEN YOU’RE ON ORBIT AS WELL. AND A LITTLE BIT OF MONITORING OF LOCAL WEATHER FOR JSC, WHICH I THINK WE’LL TALK ABOUT LATER. >> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. AND THAT’S KIND OF LIKE THE BROAD SPECTRUM OF THINGS, BUT IT’S PART OF-- AND WE’RE TALKING ABOUT THE LAYERS-- SPACEFLIGHT METEOROLOGY GROUP IS PART OF NOAA-- NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION, RIGHT? >> YEAH, SPECIFICALLY THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE. >> OKAY, YEAH, RIGHT, THERE’S EVEN MORE LAYERS TO THAT. SO WHAT’S JUST A GENERAL OVERVIEW, JUST EVEN PULLING BACK A LITTLE MORE? WHAT’S NOAA? WHAT’S THEIR CONCERN? >> NOAA IS THE AGENCY THAT’S CHARGED WITH THE OCEANS AND THE ATMOSPHERES. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE MAN IN CHARGE OR THE PERSON IN CHARGE IS THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR THE OCEANS AND ATMOSPHERES. THAT’S WHAT HIS OFFICIAL TITLE IS IN THE GOVERNMENT. NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IS A PART OF THAT. IT’S CHARGED WITH THE PROMOTING THE NATION’S ECONOMY THROUGH EFFICIENT ISSUANCE OF WEATHER FORECAST AND RIVER FORECAST WARNINGS AS WELL. >> OKAY. >> SO THAT’S WHAT THE LARGER ROLE IS. >> OKAY, ALL RIGHT. NICE LITTLE OVERVIEW THERE. SO THEN WE’RE GOING BACK DOWN TO THE SPACEFLIGHT METEOROLOGY GROUP. THINKING ABOUT SPACEFLIGHT JUST IN GENERAL, WHAT IS-- WHY IS WEATHER SUCH A CONCERN, OR WHY IS IT A CONSIDERATION WHEN YOU’RE THINKING ABOUT HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT? >> WELL, MOST VEHICLES, THEY HAVE SOME SENSITIVITY TO THE ATMOSPHERE. MOST PEOPLE WOULD THINK IT’D BE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS, WHICH ARE SOME OF THE BIGGER IMPACTS. >> YEAH. >> BUT ALSO THE WINDS NEAR THE SURFACE AND THE WINDS ALOFT. THE WINDS ALOFT WILL AFFECT THE VEHICLE TRAJECTORY ON LAUNCH AND ON LANDING AS WELL. AS WE GET BACK TO DEALING MORE WITH REENTRY VEHICLES THAT USE PARACHUTES, THEY’LL DRIFT WITH THE WIND A LITTLE BIT AS WELL. AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HIT YOUR TARGET. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> SO KNOWLEDGE OF THE UPPER WINDS IS VERY VITAL TO A SUCCESSFUL LANDING. >> OKAY, SO WHAT SORTS OF THINGS ARE YOU LOOKING AT FOR, THEN, WHEN YOU’RE LOOKING AT WEATHER AND MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPACEFLIGHT? >> IT’LL DEPEND IN LARGE PART ON THE VEHICLE AND ITS PARTICULAR SENSITIVITIES TO THE WEATHER, BUT ALMOST ALL OF THEM WILL HAVE A SENSITIVITY TO LIGHTNING. >> OKAY. >> BECAUSE YOU DON’T WANT TO GET ANY VEHICLE ON LAUNCH OR LANDING STRUCK BY LIGHTNING. >> DEFINITELY NOT. >> YOU COULD BUILD A VEHICLE THAT WAS PERFECTLY HARDENED TO JUST ABOUT ANY KIND OF WEATHER, BUT IT’D PROBABLY BE TOO HEAVY TO GET OFF THE GROUND. >> OH, YEAH. >> SO IT’S LIKE EVERYTHING IN SPACEFLIGHT-- IT’S A TRADEOFF BETWEEN WEIGHT, AND MONEY, AND THE ABILITY TO GET INTO ORBIT. >> SURE. >> SO A LOT OF THE WEATHER THINGS IMPACT THAT. SOME OF THE NEWER VEHICLES AS WELL, SINCE THEY’RE GOING TO SPLASH DOWN-- BACK TO THE FUTURE-- OR BACK TO THE PAST, IN A CERTAIN WAY. >> YEAH. >> WE’RE ALSO WORRIED ABOUT WAVE HEIGHTS AT SEA. >> OH, YEAH. >> AND THE WIND SPEEDS AT SEA. AND THE VEHICLE CAN SPLASH DOWN IN CERTAIN WAVE HEIGHTS, BUT THEN YOU HAVE A SECONDARY PROBLEM OF THE PEOPLE THAT GO OUT THERE AND TAKE THEM OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND RECOVER THE VEHICLE. >> RIGHT. >> THEY CAN’T BE EXPOSED TO HIGH WINDS, HIGH WAVES WHILE THEY’RE AT SEA AS WELL. AND THEN WHEN THINGS COME IN TO LAND ON THE LAND WITH PARACHUTES, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU DON’T WANT TO COME DOWN TOO HARD OR THE WINDS BE TOO HIGH, BECAUSE THEN THE PARACHUTE WILL DRAG IT OVER, AND IT COULD CONCEIVABLY DRAG THE CAPSULE ALONG. >> YEAH. >> USUALLY THAT’S PRETTY HIGH WIND SPEED TO DO THAT, SO THOSE LIMITS ARE USUALLY SET PRETTY HIGH. >> OKAY. >> AS I MENTION, WE WORRY ABOUT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. YOU DON’T WANT, SAY, A PARACHUTE TO GET WET. OR IF YOU HAD A REENTRY VEHICLE THAT WAS WINGED, YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE RUNWAY AS YOU’RE COMING IN. WITH A THUNDERSTORM NEARBY, YOU HAVE CONCERNS OF LIGHTNING. YOU COULD TRIGGER LIGHTNING. USUALLY WHEN AN AIRCRAFT OR A SPACE VEHICLE ENCOUNTERS LIGHTNING, IT ARTIFICIALLY TRIGGERS THE LIGHTNING-- IT’S NOT USUALLY NATURALLY OCCURRING. BECAUSE ITS MERE PRESENCE IN A HIGH ELECTRIC FIELD WILL BE THAT THING THAT SETS OFF THE LIGHTNING STRIKE. >> WOW. >> AND THAT’S WHAT HAPPENED FOR APOLLO 12 ON LAUNCH. >> HUH. >> TRIGGERED LIGHTNING TWO TIMES ON LAUNCH. >> OH, WOW. >> AND ATLAS-CENTAUR 67 IN THE LATE ‘80s TRIGGERED LIGHTNING UPON LAUNCH. IT WAS AN UNMANNED VEHICLE. >> OKAY. >> AND THAT VEHICLE HAD TO BE DESTROYED, BECAUSE IT GOT OFF TRAJECTORY. >> OH, OKAY. >> SO WE WORRY ABOUT LIGHTNING AND THUNDERSTORMS QUITE A LOT. >> YEAH. >> AND IF IT’S A WINGED VEHICLE OR A PARACHUTE VEHICLE AND YOU’RE NEARBY ENOUGH TO A THUNDERSTORM, YOU COULD ALSO ENCOUNTER SOME TURBULENCE, WHICH WOULD BE A BAD DAY. >> YEAH. >> SO THERE’S LOTS OF THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT. YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE VEHICLE. CLOUDS OUT THERE WHEN YOU LAUNCH OR RECOVER THE VEHICLE-- A LOT OF TIMES YOU WANT TO HAVE GOOD VIDEOGRAPHY OF THE VEHICLE. YOU WANT TO FILM IT SO YOU CAN GO BACK AND DO SOME ENGINEERING ANALYSIS LATER. SO YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT. CLOUDS GET IN THE WAY. >> OH, YEAH. >> SO WE WORRY QUITE A BIT ABOUT THAT AS WELL. SOME OF THE RECENT TESTING WE’VE BEEN DOING IN PREPARATION FOR SOME OF THE MISSIONS UPCOMING-- WE’RE ALSO DROPPING THE TEST VEHICLE FROM HIGH HEIGHTS, EITHER FROM AN AIRPLANE OR BY A BALLOON IN CASE FOR SOMETIMES IT CAN BE LIFTED UP BY A BALLOON. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE BALLOON’S GOING TO GO BEFORE YOU DROP SOMETHING. >> YEAH. >> BECAUSE YOU DON’T WANT TO DROP IT ON SOMEBODY OR SOMEBODY’S HOUSE. >> OF COURSE. >> YOU WANT TO KEEP IT ON THE RANGE. SO WE WORRY ABOUT THE UPPER WINDS FOR THINGS LIKE THAT AS WELL. SO THERE’S LOTS OF DIFFERENT WEATHER IDEAS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT YOU’VE GOT TO LOOK AT. >> YEAH. SO YOU IN YOUR POSITION AS METEOROLOGIST IN CHARGE, SO WHEN YOU’RE LOOKING AT THIS STUFF, YOU SAY YOU’RE LOOKING AT THIS AND YOU’VE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. YOU’RE LOOKING AT THIS, YOU’VE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT THIS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ADVISE, TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS? ARE YOU THERE IN THE TESTING FIELD LIKE SAYING, “HEY, YOU’VE GOT TO WATCH OUT FOR THESE WINDS,” OR HOW ARE YOU INVOLVED?>> MOSTLY AT SPACEFLIGHT METEOROLOGY GROUP WE’RE WORKING IN ONE OF THE MULTIPURPOSE SUPPORT ROOMS IN THE MISSION CONTROL CENTER. >> OKAY. >> THERE’S A WEATHER ROOM, ESSENTIALLY. IT’S THE SINGLE PURPOSE MULTIPURPOSE SUPPORT ROOM, I GUESS. >> OKAY. >> AND WE’VE GOT SEVERAL-- WE’VE GOT TWO MAJOR WEATHER SYSTEMS BACK THERE. ONE THAT NASA PROVIDED, THAT LEGACY SYSTEM WE’VE HAD FOR YEARS AND YEARS CALLED THE [ INDISTINCT ]. AND THEN I’VE GOT ANOTHER COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR WEATHER STUFF CALLED AWIPS II, WHICH IS IN EVERY NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE OFFICE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. >> OKAY. >> AND BOTH OF THOSE SYSTEMS GET WEATHER SATELLITE DATA, INCLUDING THE NEW  GOES-16, WHICH IS A TREMENDOUS ASSET TO THE NATION’S ECONOMY IN PROTECTION, AND IT’S A WONDERFUL SATELLITE. >> YEAH, I WAS GOING TO SAY, THAT’S THE SATELLITE, RIGHT. >> AND WE ALSO GET RADAR DATA FROM THE NETWORK OF NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE RADARS THAT ARE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ALSO GET DATA FROM THE AIR FORCE’S RADAR AT THE CAPE. THEY HAVE A WEATHER RADAR NEAR PATRICK AIR FORCE BASE WHO OVERSEE THAT. AND ALL THE COMPLETE SUITE OF THE WEATHER OBSERVATIONS FROM GROUND REPORTING STATIONS, TYPICALLY AT AIRPORTS, BUT MORE AND MORE WE’RE GETTING SMALLER SCALE MEASUREMENTS-- MEZZO SCALE IS WHAT WE CALL IT-- AND A LOT OF THOSE ARE SPECIAL NETWORKS, INCLUDING SOME THAT NASA OPERATES, AND THE OTHER SPACE AND MISSILE RANGES OPERATE, THAT DENSE NETWORK OF SURFACE OBSERVATIONS. AND A LOT OF THEM ARE HOME HOBBYISTS. >> OH! >> WE RETRIEVED THAT DATA AS WELL. IT DOES NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE QUALITY CONTROL FROM TIME TO TIME, BUT WE DO DRAG THAT IN, SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE QUITE A LOT OF DATA. AND THEN OUT IN THE FIELD, THEY’LL TYPICALLY BE-- ESPECIALLY ON THE DoD SPACE AND MISSILE RANGES, WHERE WE DO A LOT OF THE ACTIVITIES, THERE’LL BE SOME METEOROLOGIST OR METEOROLOGISTS IN THE FIELD, AND THEY’LL BE RELEASING SPECIAL WEATHER BALLOONS FOR US AS WELL, AND TAKING SPECIAL SURFACE LEVEL MEASUREMENTS AS WELL. AND THERE’S OTHER TECHNOLOGIES TO MEASURE THE UPPER WINDS. THERE’S SOME WIND PROFILERS THAT WE USE. SO WE COLLECT ALL THAT DATA FROM THE FIELD BACK HERE IN THE MCC, AND WE’LL ADVISE THE FLIGHT CONTROL TEAM. >> OH. >> PRIMARILY THE FLIGHT DIRECTOR. >> OKAY. >> MY OFFICE IS ATTACHED TO THE FLIGHT DIRECTOR OFFICE HERE AT JSC. >> OKAY. >> SO I HAVE A NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE BOSS AND A NASA BOSS. MY NASA BOSS IS ONE OF THE FLIGHT DIRECTORS. TYPICALLY, THE ASCENT AND ENTRY FLIGHT DIRECTORS. >> OKAY. IS THAT MAINLY WHEN YOU’RE PULLED IN, ASCENT AND ENTRY? >> YEAH. >> OKAY. >> WELL, WHEN THERE’S A MISSION ON ORBIT, WE WILL MONITOR SOME THINGS. >> SURE. >> FOR EXAMPLE, FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, I’M ON CALL IF I’M NOT ON CONSOLE. >> OKAY. >> SO IF THEY HAVE SOME SORT OF EMERGENCY AND THEY’VE GOT TO GET INTO SOYUZ AND THEY WANT TO MAINTAIN SITUATIONAL AWARENESS OF WHERE THEY COULD LAND, I CAN BE CALLED IN AND PROVIDE WEATHER SUPPORT FOR THAT AS WELL. >> OKAY, AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT WHEREVER THEY’RE GOING TO LAND, YOU HAVE A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT THAT WEATHER’S GOING TO BE AT THAT TIME. >> YEAH, AND FOR THE SOYUZ CAPSULE IN PARTICULAR, IT’S PRETTY ROBUST WEATHER-WISE. >> YEAH. >> THE RUSSIANS MAKE PRETTY HARDY HARDWARE. >> YEAH. THEY’VE LAUNCHED IN COLD WEATHER. >> YES THE HAVE. >> AND ALL KINDS OF STUFF, SO YEAH, EXCELLENT VEHICLE. YOU KNOW, YOU SAY YOU’RE BACK IN MISSION CONTROL AND YOU’RE GETTING ALL OF THESE DATA FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE KEY THINGS THAT YOU’RE LOOKING FOR? WHAT DO YOU NEED TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION, WHAT KINDS OF DATA? >> TYPICALLY IT’D BE THE WIND SPEEDS. >> WIND SPEEDS, OKAY. >> ESPECIALLY NEAR THE SURFACE. AND FROM THE WEATHER BALLOON, IT’LL BE THE WINDS THAT WE MEASURE ALOFT. WE’LL COMBINE THOSE OBSERVATIONS WITH THE COMPUTER MODEL FORECAST THAT WE HAVE, AND WE GET THOSE FROM OUR NATIONAL CENTER. AND ON OCCASION WE’LL RUN SOME SPECIAL LOCALIZED MODELS AS WELL AT A HIGHER SCALE. >> YEAH. >> AND WE’LL BLEND THOSE TOGETHER AND COME UP WITH A FORECAST AT THE LANDING TIME. >> OKAY, OKAY. >> ALSO WE’LL MONITOR THE RADAR, OF COURSE. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DON’T KNOW THIS-- THERE’S LIGHTNING DETECTION NETWORKS OUT THERE NOW, SO WE CAN TELL WHERE LIGHTNING’S STRIKING THE GROUND. >> WOW. >> YEAH, IT’S PRETTY NEAT. THERE’S SEVERAL NETWORKS OUT THERE, AND ALSO WE HAVE WHAT’S CALLED LIGHTNING MAPPING ARRAYS OR-- WHICH IS A THREE-DIMENSIONAL LIGHTNING DISPLAY, WHICH WILL SHOW LIGHTNING BOLTS IN THREE DIMENSIONS SO YOU CAN SEE THE IN-CLOUD FLASHES AS WELL. IT’S-- I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE AND I SAW THAT KIND OF DATA. I WAS LIKE, “WOW, THAT STUFF EXISTS?” AND IT’S STILL, TO THIS DAY IT’S STILL REALLY PHENOMENAL AND REALLY NEAT TO LOOK AT. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> SO THAT’S HOW WE MONITOR FOR THE LIGHTNING DATA. >> OKAY. >> WITH THAT AND THE RADAR AS WELL. >> SO YOU CAN-- OBVIOUSLY, IT HAS A LOT OF SPACEFLIGHT APPLICATIONS, BUT THAT SOUNDS LIKE LIGHTNING DATA, THAT COULD BE USED FOR SOMETHING ELSE, RIGHT? >> OH, YEAH, POWER COMPANIES USE IT ALL THE TIME. >> OH, YEAH. >> MATTER OF FACT, SOME OF THE INITIAL FUNDS WAY BACK IN THE LATE ‘80s-- EARLY ‘80s, GOT THAT STARTED WAS SOME OF THE POWER COMPANIES WANTED TO KNOW WHEN THEIR LINES WERE GOING TO GO DOWN, THAT SORT OF THING. >> YEAH. >> SO THAT’S WHERE A LOT OF THE INITIAL IMPETUS FOR THAT KIND OF RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY CAME ABOUT. BUT IT’S EXPANDED INTO LOTS OF SECTORS OF THE COUNTRY  RIGHT NOW. >> OH, SURE. THAT SEEMS-- THAT’S GOOD DATA. >> OH, AND THERE’S A LIGHTNING SENSOR THAT’S ON THE NEW GOES-16 SATELLITE AS WELL. >> OKAY. >> SO, AND IT’LL SEND DATA DOWN TO THE GROUND EVERY 20 SECONDS AND IT USES AN OPTICAL DETECTOR FOR THAT. SO YOU HAVE PRACTICALLY GLOCAL COVER-- WELL, AT LEAST HALF THE GLOBE THAT THE SATELLITE CAN SEE FROM GEOSTATIONARY ORBIT. >> OKAY. >> SO THEIR LIGHTNING DATA IS EVERYWHERE NOW. >> YEAH. WHAT’S MORE ABOUT THE GOES-16 SATELLITE, WHAT IS THAT? >> GOES-16 IS THE NEW GEOSTATIONARY SATELLITE, WHICH MEANS IT SITS IN A RELATIVE POSITION-- SAME RELATIVE POSITION OVER THE EARTH ALL THE TIME. >> RIGHT. >> IT SCANS THE EARTH ROUTINELY EVERY 5 MINUTES. >> WOW. >> IT'S GOT WHAT’S CALLED TWO MESOSCALE SECTORS, WHICH YOU CAN ZOOM IN ON A SMALLER PART OF THE EARTH, AND IT’LL SCAN THOSE EVERY MINUTE, AND IF YOU OVERLAP THOSE TWO YOU CAN GET DATA EVERY 30 SECONDS. SO IT LOOKS LIKE A HIGH RESOLUTION MOVIE. >> OH. >> THE VISIBLE CHANNEL IS TWICE THE-- HAS TWICE THE PRECISION OF THE PREVIOUS ERA OF SATELLITE, SO YOU SEE MORE DATA, SMALLER DATA. AND IT'S ALSO GOT MORE INFRARED CHANNELS SO YOU CAN SEE HOW THE WATER VAPOR’S MOVING AROUND THE ATMOSPHERE, YOU CAN SEE CLOUDS, YOU CAN SEE AREAS OF-- THAT RESPOND TO SULFUR CONTENT. SO YOU CAN PICK OUT VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH IT. >> WHOA. >> YEAH, THERE’S A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH IT AND IT’S-- GET ON THE WEB, LOOK FOR GOES-16, LOOK FOR HIGH-RES MOVIE LOOP. IT’S REALLY COOL TO LOOK AT. >> YEAH. >> AND FOR A SCIENTIST, IT’S REALLY EXCITING DATA. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> AND FOR THE SPACEFLIGHT SIDE OF THAT, NOW THAT WE GET DATA MORE FREQUENTLY WE CAN-- IF A SITUATION’S KIND OF DICEY ON WHAT’S GOING ON WITH CLOUD COVER, YOU CAN WATCH THAT RIGHT UP ALMOST UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE AND YOU DON’T HAVE TO WAIT. PREVIOUSLY, WE’D HAVE TO WAIT UP TO 15 MINUTES FOR THE DATA TO COME IN. AND A LOT CAN HAPPEN IN 15 MINUTES. >> YEAH. >> FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE SHUTTLE ERA, FOR THE RETURN TO LAUNCH SITE ABORT, THAT WAS 25 MINUTES AFTER LANDING. IF WE HAD TO WAIT 15 MINUTES FOR A SATELLITE PICTURE, SOMETHING CAN MOVE A LONG WAY OR FORM PRETTY QUICKLY IN THAT AMOUNT OF TIME, WHICH IS ALMOST THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME YOU’RE TRYING TO FORECAST. >> WOW. >> IT’S REALLY NICE. >> DID THE NEEDS OF THE SHUTTLE PROGRAM SORT OF DRIVE THIS, LIKE, THE NEED FOR QUICKER DATA? >> NO, NOT DIRECTLY. >> OKAY. >> BUT IT WAS MORE OR LESS JUST TECHNOLOGY MARCHING ON. >> OH, YEAH. >> YEAH. >> WHICH IT WILL DO, RIGHT? SO THE GOES-16, I DO REMEMBER SEEING A LOT OF IMAGERY WHEN HARVEY WAS PASSING THROUGH. >> YES. >> THEY WERE-- THERE WAS A LOT THAT WAS BEING MONITORED. I THINK SOIL SATURATION, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. >> SOIL MOISTURE, SOIL SATURATION. >> YEAH, YEAH. >> YEAH, ONE OF THE INFRARED CHANNELS WILL RESPOND TO WATER ON THE GROUND REALLY WELL AND YOU CAN SEE THE SOILS BECOME SATURATED USING THE INFRARED CHANNELS. >> YEAH. >> SO THE NEAR CHANNELS THAT RESPOND TO VEGETATION. >> OKAY. >> YEAH, IT’S SOMETHING WE DIDN’T HAVE BEFORE. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> YEAH. >> SO BACK-- LET’S GO TO THE SHUTTLE PROGRAM FOR A BIT. WERE YOU-- DID YOU WORK THE SHUTTLE PROGRAM, THE WEATHER FOR IT? >> YES, I DID. >> OKAY. >> SINCE 1991 IS WHEN I ARRIVED. >> OKAY. >> AND FOR ABOUT ‘92 WAS THE SPACE SHUTTLE MISSIONS. >> ALL RIGHT. >> AND I WAS THE ASCENT ENTRY LEAD FORECASTER HERE AT SMG FOR ABOUT 14 OF THOSE. >> ALL RIGHT. >> SO IT WAS QUITE A LOT OF THEM. >> ASCENT ENTRY-- OKAY, SO WHAT DID THAT LOOK LIKE? WHAT SORTS OF THINGS WERE YOU DOING SPECIFICALLY FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS IN FLORIDA, LAUNCHES AND LANDINGS? >> FOR FLORIDA, ON ASCENT DAY, SMG WAS PRIMARILY WORRIED ABOUT THE WEATHER AT THE ABORT LANDING SITES. >> OKAY. >> ONE OF THOSE WAS THE RETURN TO LAUNCH SITE, WHICH WOULD’VE BEEN THE SHUTTLE LANDING FACILITY THERE AT THE KENNEDY SPACE CENTER. >> OKAY. >> THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THAT ON A LAUNCH DAY WAS WHILE EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING OUT TOWARDS THE PAD FROM THE LAUNCH CONTROL CENTER, IT LOOKED OUT OVER THE OCEAN. AND IF A SEA BREEZE MOVED INLAND YOU COULD HAVE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OCCURRING BEHIND YOU OVER AT THE SHUTTLE LANDING FACILITY. >> OH. >> SO YOU’D LOOK OUT ONE DIRECTION AND IT’S, “OH, IT’S GREAT. WHY ARE WE WAITING?” AND YET, AT FIVE MILES BEHIND YOU THERE’S A THUNDERSTORM GOING ON. >> OKAY. >> THE OTHER THING WE WOULD LOOK AT WOULD BE THE TRANSOCEANIC ABORT LANDING SITES. THOSE WERE IN AFRICA AND SPAIN, AND LATER IN FRANCE. AND WE’D MONITOR THE WEATHER FOR THOSE AS WELL. ON LAUNCH DAY YOU HAD TO HAVE GOOD RTLS WEATHER, RETURN TO LAUNCH SITE, AND YOU HAD TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE OF THE TRANSOCEANIC ABORT LANDING SITES HAD TO HAVE GOOD WEATHER. AND WE DID ACTUALLY SCRUB FOUR LAUNCHES FOR TAL WEATHER DURING THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM. >> WOW, JUST BECAUSE NOTHING WAS LINING UP AT THOSE TIMES? >> ALL THREE OR ALL FOUR SITES WOULD BE DOWN FOR THE WEATHER CRITERIA. >> HUH. >> AND YOU WERE NOT A POPULAR PERSON ON THAT DAY BECAUSE THAT MEANT THAT THE WEATHER WAS GOOD AT KSC AND EVERYBODY’S WAITING FOR SOMETHING THAT’S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN. >> RIGHT. >> BUT, YOU KNOW, KEEPING THOSE ASTRONAUT’S SAFETY IN MIND, THAT’S WHY THOSE RULES WERE THERE. >> YEAH. WHAT WERE SOME OF THE BIG TAKEAWAYS THAT YOU LEARNED IN YOUR TENURE AT WORKING SHUTTLE? >> MOSTLY THE NEWER TECHNOLOGY THAT CAME ALONG WE GOT BETTER AND BETTER AT FORECASTING. >> AH. >> EARLY ON, WE WERE KIND OF SPLIT BETWEEN LANDING AT KSC AND AT EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE. EACH SITE HAD ITS OWN UNIQUE WEATHER ISSUES. AT EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE IS TYPICALLY THE SURFACE WINDS WERE GOING TO BE A PROBLEM, EITHER THE CROSSWINDS OR A HEADWIND FOR THE SHUTTLE. >> OKAY. >> KSC, YOU KNOW, WE USUALLY PICKED LAUNCH AND LANDING TIMES-- WE USE SOME CLIMATOLOGY TO HELP PICK THOSE, SO WE USUALLY WOULD LAUNCH DURING THE TIME OF THE DAY THAT WAS GOOD FOR THAT. SO THE RTLS WEATHER WOULD GENERALLY BE GOOD. ONCE WE HAD THE GROUND-UP RENDEZVOUS TO THE SPACE STATION THAT MEANT YOU COULDN’T CHOOSE THE LAUNCH TIME ANYMORE LIKE YOU USED TO. YOU USED TO ALWAYS BE EARLY IN THE MORNING WHEN THE WEATHER’S TYPICALLY GOOD AND THE WINDS ARE LIGHT. >> OKAY. >> BUT WHEN YOU HAD GROUND-UP RENDEZVOUS YOU’RE PRETTY MUCH HAVE TO BE IN THE SAME ORBITAL PLANE AS THE ISS. >> RIGHT. >> WHICH MEANT ANY TIME OF DAY. THEN WE STARTED MOVING INTO THE LATE AFTERNOON. WE RAN INTO MORE THUNDERSTORMS. WE RAN INTO MORE CROSSWINDS BECAUSE THE WAY THE RUNWAY’S BUILT OUT THERE, IT’S PARALLEL WITH THE COAST. SEA BREEZE WOULD COME IN WITH AN EAST WIND, THAT’D BE ALL CROSSWINDS. SO WE GOT MORE AND MORE INSTRUMENTATION TO TRACK THE SEA BREEZE. WE CAN DO THAT WITH A REALLY DENSE NETWORK OF SURFACE WIND TOWERS. YOU CAN ALSO SEE IT ON THE RADAR AND YOU CAN ALSO SEE IT ON SATELLITE IMAGERY AS WELL. SO THE WAY TECHNOLOGY HAS HELPED US WITH THAT AND THEN THE ADVANCES IN COMPUTER MODELING FOR FORECASTING, IT KEPT GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER IN THE SCALE THAT YOU COULD LOOK AT AND THE SHORTER TIMES THAT YOU COULD LOOK AT AND IT KEPT GETTING BETTER AND BETTER. SO THINGS ALWAYS-- SEEMS LIKE WE GOT MUCH BETTER AS WE GOT ALONG IN THE SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM. >> VERY COOL. >> YEAH. >> SO THE SHUTTLE PROGRAM ENDED IN 2011. NOW, WE’RE INTO 2017 LOOKING FORWARD TO COMMERCIAL CREW LAUNCHES HERE SOON. WHAT TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN DEVELOPING OVER THESE PAST COUPLE YEARS THAT WE CAN APPLY TO COMMERCIAL CREW? >> FOR COMMERCIAL CREW WE GOT THE NEWER SATELLITE WE’VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, GOES-16. >> YEAH. >> WE’RE GETTING NEWER AND MORE PORTABLE WEATHER BALLOON SYSTEMS THAT WE CAN USE AS WELL. >> HMM. >> I’VE GOT ONE BACK IN THE OFFICE, WHERE IT’S A GROUND RECEIVER. IT’S A LAPTOP COMPUTER AND A HANDHELD RADIO, ESSENTIALLY, AND A LITTLE TINY ANTENNA. YOU USED TO, YOU HAD TO HAVE A GREAT BIG RADIO DIRECTION FINDER THAT WOULD FOLLOW THE BALLOON OR YOU WOULD TRACK IT WITH RADAR. >> YEAH. >> NOW, IT’S ALL GPS BASED. >> OKAY. >> SO IT’S HIGHER PRECISION, MORE PORTABLE, MORE BETTER EVERYTHING, AS A MATTER OF FACT. AS TECHNOLOGY’S GOTTEN BETTER WE’VE GOTTEN BETTER MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS AND BETTER FORECASTING SYSTEMS AS WELL. BUT IN LARGE PART, IT’S STILL THE SAME OLD METEOROLOGY WE’RE USING AND APPLYING FOR THE NEW VEHICLES THAT ARE COMING DOWN THE-- BOTH SLS, ORION, AND THE COMMERCIAL CREW PROGRAMS. >> OKAY. ALL RIGHT. A LOT OF THE SAME STUFF. SO ARE YOU-- IS THE WEATHER THAT TAKES PLACE FOR LAUNCHES AND LANDINGS, WHAT ELSE BESIDES, YOU KNOW, JUST MAINLY ASCENT AND ENTRY, ARE YOU LOOKING AT THAT HELPS OUT WITH HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT? >> OH, IN TERMS OF THE-- JUST ABOUT ALL OF THE WEATHER THAT YOU CAN THINK OF, REALLY. >> OH, OKAY. >> YEAH. >> YEAH. >> LIKE I SAID, IT DEPENDS UPON THE VEHICLE. SOMETIMES YOU’LL BE LOOKING AT THE HUMIDITY, SOMETIMES YOU’LL BE LOOKING AT THE CLOUD COVERAGE, SOMETIMES  IT’S THE RADAR. USUALLY, IT’S ALL OF THE ABOVE. >> YEAH. >> AND YOU ALSO HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE OUT ON THINGS THAT AREN’T NECESSARILY WEATHER RELATED AS WELL. >> HMM. >> BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU’LL SEE THINGS ON RADAR THAT ARE-- THAT LOOK LIKE A SHOWER OR A THUNDERSTORM AND IT TURNS OUT IT’S CHAFF. IT’S THE SAME-- IT’S WHAT THE MILITARY DROPS TIN FOIL, LITTLE DROPLETS TO FOOL RADAR. >> OH. >> AND WHEN THEY’RE DOING TESTS, YOU KNOW, THAT’LL PICK UP ON THE WEATHER RADAR. >> I SEE. >> AND WE’VE HAD THAT IN THE PAST IN THE SHUTTLE PROGRAM. >> OKAY. >> THAT’S ONE OF THE THINGS-- SO YOU GOT TO BE AWARE OF WHEN THEY’RE DOING TESTS AND EXERCISES UPWIND FROM YOU BECAUSE THAT STUFF’LL BLOW OVER YOU. >> OH. >> SO THERE’S-- YOU GOT TO KEEP AN EYE ON LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS WHAT’S GOING ON, AS WELL AS THE STATE OF THE EQUIPMENT. AND ON OCCASION, THE SATELLITES, THEY’LL SHUT THEM DOWN WHEN THEY’RE LOOKING AT THE SUN DURING CERTAIN PERIODS. IF YOU’RE LOOKING AT LOW EARTH ORBITING SATELLITES, YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE IT COMES OVER AT THE RIGHT TIME. SO THERE’S A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS, NOT JUST PURE METEOROLOGY, BUT THE LOGISTICAL SIDE THAT YOU GOT TO MAINTAIN AWARENESS OF AS WELL. >> YEAH. >> AS WELL AS KNOWING WHAT THE FLIGHT CONTROL TEAM’S DOING. >> YEAH. IS THERE-- SO, IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF THE WEATHER THAT YOU’RE LOOKING AT IS WITHIN THE ATMOSPHERE. YOU HAVE A LOT OF DATA COMING THERE. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT KIND OF GOES INTO SPACE? IS THERE A SPACE WEATHER ELEMENT TO THIS? >> THERE IS. GENERALLY, THE TRUE SPACE WEATHER, THINGS LIKE SOLAR FLARES, GEOMAGNETIC STORMS, LIKE THAT. THERE’S A GROUP HERE AT JOHNSON SPACE CENTER CALLED THE SHRAG, THE SPACE RADIATION ANALYSIS GROUP. >> COOL. >> YEAH. THEY GENERALLY HANDLE MOST OF THAT ACTIVITY, AND THEY WORK CLOSELY WITH ANOTHER NOAA CENTER AS A MATTER OF FACT. >> OH. >> THERE’S THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT GROUP, WHICH IS IN BOULDER. IT’S A NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE OFFICE AND THEY MAINTAIN ALL THE FORECASTS FOR SPACE WEATHER FOR THE COUNTRY, BECAUSE IT-- BUT GENERALLY, IN SMG, SPACEFLIGHT METEOROLOGY GROUP, WE’RE LOOKING AT WEATHER PRIMARILY IN THE LOWEST LIKE 100,000 FEET. ALTHOUGH, ON OCCASION, WE DO GO HIGHER FOR VEHICLES THAT COME IN ON LIKE A HIGH INCLINATION TRAJECTORY. THEY’RE COMING IN IN AN ORBIT THAT GOES LIKE 57 DEGREES NORTH AND SOUTH. >> HMM. >> DURING CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR YOU DO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THINGS LIKE NOCTILUCENT CLOUDS, WHICH ARE ABOUT 82 KILOMETERS HIGH IN THE ATMOSPHERE. >> OH. >> YEAH, WE HAD THE DESIGN CRITERIA FOR SHUTTLE FOR THAT BECAUSE YOU DIDN’T WANT TO FLY THROUGH THAT BECAUSE IT’S A CLOUD AND YOU’RE GOING VERY, VERY FAST AT THOSE ALTITUDES. >> YEAH. >> BUT, THEY’RE GENERALLY RESTRICTED TO VERY HIGH LATITUDES. >> HMM. >> SAO, WE USUALLY DIDN’T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT AND THAT MISSION WAS DESIGNED AROUND THAT. >> OKAY. >> ON OCCASION, WE DID DO SOME THINGS THAT WERE UP IN THE MESOSPHERE, THE STRATOSPHERE, THE HIGHER ATMOSPHERE. BUT GENERALLY, IT’S WHAT MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER WEATHER IS WHAT WE’RE LOOKING AT. >> OKAY. SO HOW DOES WEATHER RELATE TO CLIMATE? YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT LOOKING AT WEATHER THROUGH LONG PERIODS OF TIME. >> MM-HMM. >> YOU HAVE A LOT OF DATA AND THE DATA SEEMS TO JUST BE-- THE INSTRUMENTS USED TO GATHER DATA ARE JUST GETTING BETTER AND BETTER. IS THERE A RELATIONSHIP THERE, WEATHER AND CLIMATE? >> YEAH. THE OLD SAYING IS CLIMATE IS WHAT YOU EXPECT, YOU KNOW, FROM-- YOU EXPECT WINTER TO BE COLD. >> YEAH. >> AND WEATHER IS WHAT YOU GET DAY TO DAY. >> MM-HMM. >> YOU CAN THINK OF IT ALONG TERMS LIKE THAT. SO I MENTIONED EARLIER, FOR SPACE SHUTTLE, A LOT OF MISSIONS WERE PLANNED WITH CLIMATE DATA IN MIND IN THAT WE KNEW THAT EARLY IN THE MORNING WINDS WERE LIGHT. >> RIGHT. >> SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WOULDN’T BE AROUND. SO A LOT OF THOSE WERE PLANNED WITH THAT IN MIND. >> MM-HMM. >> A LOT OF THE DESIGN CRITERIA FOR SOME OF THE NEW PROGRAMS COMING UP, WE’RE INTO THAT, AS WELL AS WE’VE GONE AND LOOKED AT THE OCEAN WAVE CLIMATOLOGY, ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC. A LOT OF THE MISSIONS ARE DESIGNED WITH THAT IN MIND BECAUSE IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC, FOR EXAMPLE, WAVES GET PRETTY HIGH, ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTER TIME-- 20, 30 FOOT WAVES, THEY’RE NOT ALL THE UNCOMMON. >> YEAH. >> AND YOU REALLY CAN’T DESIGN A VEHICLE TO LAST VERY LONG IF IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO SPLASH DOWN IN THAT, EITHER THROUGH SOME SORT OF CONTINGENCY OR AN ABORT. >> YEAH. >> SO MOST OF THE VEHICLES ARE DESIGNED THAT IF THEY DO ABORT THEY’LL TURN AROUND AND NOT-- AND AVOID THOSE AREAS. SO THAT’S ONE WAY CLIMATE DATA, LONG TERM HISTORICAL DATA, HAS BEEN USED TO HELP PLAN THOSE KIND OF ACTIVITIES. >> RIGHT. >> AND THE OTHER THING IS, EVEN BACK IN THE SHUTTLE DAYS WHEN WE USED TO LAND ON THE EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE LAKE BEDS, YOU KNOW, GENERALLY THEY’RE DRY, BUT THEY’RE STILL A LAKE BED. AND WE WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT A LOT OF THE DATA FOR THAT BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY WOULD FILL UP WITH WATER AND THOSE TYPICALLY HAPPEN DURING EL NINO YEARS. >> OH. >> WHICH ARE USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH HEAVIER THAN NORMAL PRECIPITATION AND RAINFALL IN THE DESERT SOUTHWEST IN THE WINTER TIME. SO IF WE KNEW THERE WAS AN EL NINO YEAR COMING UP WE HAD A PRETTY GOOD IDEA THAT WE MIGHT LOSE THE LAKE BEDS AND WE’D HAVE TO LAND IT STRICTLY ON THE CONCRETE RUNWAY OUT THERE. >> OH. >> SO THERE’S A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN USE CLIMATE DATA FOR, GENERALLY IN THE PLANNING AND DESIGN STAGE FOR JUST ABOUT ANY SPACECRAFT. >> HUH. IS THERE MAJOR CLIMATE CONSIDERATIONS FOR-- OR NOT-- NECESSARILY MAJOR, BUT JUST ANYTHING YOU’RE WATCHING OUT FOR FOR COMMERCIAL CREW LAUNCHES IN THE FUTURE? >> THERE WILL BE, AT LEAST IN THE SORT OF THE SHORTER TIME SPAN BETWEEN WEATHER AND CLIMATE. >> OKAY. >> BECAUSE FOR COMMERCIAL CREW AND ALSO FOR ORION, WHEN WE GO TO THE MOON SOME OF THOSE MISSIONS ARE GOING TO BE VERY LONG DURATION. >> YEAH. >> SO YOU’RE GETTING OUT PAST THE TYPICAL ABILITY TO FORECAST DAY TO DAY WEATHER. SO YOU’RE LOOKING MORE AT WHAT THE WEATHER THREE AND FOUR WEEKS OUT MIGHT BE LIKE. >> MM-HMM. >> AND A LOT OF THAT IS CLIMATE BASED AND YOU CAN USE SOME OF THE LONGER RANGED CLIMATE KIND OF WEATHER PATTERNS, LIKE EL NINO. >> YEAH. >> OR MADDEN-JULIAN OSCILLATIONS, THINGS LIKE THAT THAT HAPPEN IN THE TROPICS TO HELP YOU PREDICT WHAT THE GENERAL TREND THAT WE-- IT MIGHT BE DRYER THAT WEEK. >> OH. >> IT MIGHT BE LESS WINDY THAT WEEK. >> OKAY. >> OR IT MIGHT BE MORE STORMY, WHICH WOULD DRIVE MORE HIGHER OCEAN WAVES, THAT SORT OF THING. >> HMM. >> WE DO LOOK AT SOME OF THAT KIND OF DATA AS WELL, EVEN IN THE OPERATIONS. >> SO WHEN YOU SAY BEYOND YOUR CAPACITY TO LOOK FOR WEATHER, BECAUSE YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT ORION MISSIONS AND SOME OF THESE MOON MISSIONS ARE SEVERAL DAYS, SEVERAL WEEKS, SO YOU GOT TO PLAN AHEAD, BUT YOU ONLY CAN GO TOWARD A CERTAIN LIMIT. I KNOW WHENEVER I LISTEN TO THE WEATHER FORECAST OR GO AND CHECK IT IT CAN ONLY GO FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS. AND EVEN THEN IT’S-- YOU THROW YOUR HANDS UP IN THE AIR BECAUSE YOU’RE NOT SURE. >> YEAH, THE THEORETICAL LIMIT FOR ABOUT A DAY TO DAY KIND OF FORECAST IS ABOUT TWO WEEKS. YOU KNOW, WE’RE NOT EVEN REALLY THAT GOOD YET. >> OKAY. >> WE’VE GOT COMPUTER MODELS THAT’LL SPIT THOSE OUT ALL THE TIME. >> YEAH. >> BUT THERE’S LARGER SCALE, IF YOU LOOK MORE TOWARDS THE MEANS AND EXTREMES, YOU CAN PRESS THAT OUT AND GET A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN. >> HMM. >> LIKE I MENTIONED, THREE WEEKS FROM NOW WE EXPECT IT TO BE VERY DRY THAT WEEK. >> YEAH. >> THAT DOESN’T TELL YOU IT’S GOING TO BE 34 DEGREES AT 7:00 A.M. IN THE MORNING, BUT IF YOU’RE JUST INTERESTED IN, “I DON’T WANT IT TO BE WET. I’VE GOT THIS THING SITTING OUTDOORS I CAN’T GET WET. I GOT A PAYLOAD SITTING OUTSIDE THAT CAN’T GET WET.” >> OH, YEAH. >> THAT’S THE KIND OF GOOD THING TO KNOW AS WELL. >> OKAY, COOL. SO, BESIDES LAUNCHES, AND LANDINGS, AND PLANNING FOR FORECASTS, WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS HERE AT THE CENTER? BECAUSE WE HAVE MISSION CONTROL AND MISSION CONTROL HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE’RE OPERATING. SO I’M GUESSING THERE’S CERTAIN IMPLICATIONS FOR WEATHER HERE AT THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER? >> YES, I DO MAINTAIN A BASIC SORT OF WEATHER WATCH WHENEVER I’M ON DUTY FOR THE SPACE CENTER. >> OKAY. >> AND FOR THOSE ON SITE, IF YOU RECEIVE THOSE EMAIL WARNINGS FROM [ INDISTINCT ]. SOME PEOPLE USUALLY PASS THOSE ON. AND FOR THE LIGHTNING ALERTS, OR SOME SEVERE WEATHER, I’LL BE THE ONE GENERALLY SENDING THOSE OUT. >> OKAY. >> AS A MATTER OF FACT, I THINK TI HAS MY NAME ON THE BOTTOM OF IT. >> YEAH. >> AND THAT’S GENERALLY DONE FOR EVERYONE’S PERSONAL SAFETY HERE ON THE CENTER. >> OKAY. >> FOR THE MISSION CONTROL TEAM AND THE-- A LARGE PART OF THAT IS TO MAINTAIN SO THAT THEY KNOW IF THEY’RE GOING TO HAVE ANY POWER OUTAGES COMING THEIR WAY. >> HMM. >> AND ALSO, FOR SOME OF THE MEDIA PLANNING FOR SOME OF THEIR COMMUNICATIONS TO AND FROM THE SPACECRAFT, ESPECIALLY THE ISS, I’LL MONITOR THE LOCAL WEATHER AND ALSO WEATHER AT SOME OF THE TDRS DOWNLINK SITES. >> OH, THAT’S RIGHT. >> WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE. >> YEAH. >> AND ALSO, OVER AT GUAM. THEY HAVE ANOTHER ANTENNA. >> OKAY. >> SO I MONITOR THAT, BUT FOR TROPICAL SEASON, FOR LIKE HURRICANES, THE ISS FLIGHT CONTROL TEAM, IF THEY NEED TO THEY CAN SHUT DOWN THE CENTER. THEY CAN RELOCATE AND SET UP SHOP SOMEPLACE ELSE REMOTELY AND STILL CONTROL THE SPACE STATION. >> RIGHT. >> AND PART OF THAT PLANNING IS, “WELL, WE WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE HURRICANE’S GOING TO GO.” >> YEAH. >> SO I’LL BRIEF THE FLIGHT CONTROL TEAM HERE, AS WELL AS THE CENTER DIRECTOR AND THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT FOLKS HERE AT JSC ON THE POTENTIAL OF THE HURRICANE’S TRACK. AND I’LL TAILOR IT SO IT’S SPECIFIC TO THE CENTER ITSELF AND OUR OPERATIONS. >> OKAY, I SEE. >> SO WHAT WAS HARVEY LIKE THEN? BECAUSE I KNOW HARVEY WAS PRETTY RECENT AND-- >> HARVEY WAS VERY RECENT. THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT HARVEY IS OVER THE FOUR DAYS THAT IT RAINED AROUND HERE WE GOT-- IT WAS 40-- I WROTE IT DOWN, BROUGHT IT WITH ME BECAUSE I COULDN’T REMEMBER-- 42.99 INCHES OF RAIN HERE AT JSC. >> WHOA! >> WHICH EASILY SET A RECORD. WE HAD 20.72 INCHES THAT OCCURRED IN ONE DAY. >> WHOA. >> SO THAT’S OVER A FOOT AND A HALF OF RAIN IN ONE DAY. >> YEAH. >> NEARLY FOUR FEET OVER THE COURSE OF FOUR DAYS. SO I SENT OUT SOME MESSAGES AND BRIEFED THE CENTER DIRECTORS AND THE EMERGENCY MANAGERS HERE AT JSC DURING THE STORM. >> MM-HMM. >> I ALSO MAINTAINED THESE OBSERVATIONS, WHICH I DON’T KNOW YOUR LISTENERS IF THEY’RE INTERESTED, IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT THE WEATHER IS HERE AT JSC, PARTICULARLY ON BUILDING 30, THERE’S SOME WEATHER INSTRUMENTATION THAT THE CENTER OF OPERATIONS DIRECTORATE MAINTAINS.AND I TAKE THAT DATA AND I POST IT OUT INTO THE WORLD WIDE WEB. >> OKAY. >> SO YOU CAN GO TO WEATHER.GOV/SMG/BLDG30-- BUILDING 30. >> OKAY. >> AND IT’LL GIVE YOU THE LATEST WEATHER FROM THE ROOFTOP. SO I MAINTAIN THAT DATA GOING OUT FOR EVERYONE TO USE. >> YEAH. >> GOT ANOTHER RAIN GAUGE HERE ON SITE, AN OLD STYLE RAIN GAUGE OUT NEAR BUILDING 421. INTERESTING THING DURING HARVEY WAS, I CAME OUT ON SATURDAY TO EMPTY THAT RAIN GAUGE, BECAUSE IT HOLDS 11 INCHES AND I FIGURED IT MIGHT FILL UP. >> YEAH. >> SO I DUMPED IT OUT AND IT HAD ABOUT 7 OR 8 INCHES. AFTER THAT, I COULDN’T GET BACK ON SITE. >> OH, THAT’S RIGHT. >> YEAH, SO THAT ONE I DON’T KNOW HOW MUCH IT HAD IN IT. BUT THE RAIN GAUGE ON TOP OF THE ROOF, IT’S WHAT WE CALL A TIPPING BUCKET. IT CONTINUOUSLY MEASURES. SO THAT’S THE ONE WE KNOW WHERE WE GOT 42.99 INCHES OF RAIN. >> OH, OKAY. >> WHICH IS QUITE A LOT OF RAIN. >> YEAH, YOU SAID RECORD-- >> BUT, OVERALL, THE FLOODING HERE ON SITE, DIRECTLY ON SITE, WASN’T TOO BAD, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND. >> OKAY. >> JUST COULDN’T GET HERE. >> YEAH. >> OR LEAVE HERE. >> DID YOU HAVE ANY-- DID YOU ADVISE WHETHER TO SHUT DOWN THE CENTER OR ANY SORT OF-- DID YOU HAVE ANY CONTINGENCY PLANS IN PLACE KNOWING THE WEATHER? >> YEAH, LEADING UP TO IT, BRIEFED THE CENTER OF OPERATIONS FOLKS AND THE ISS CONTROL TEAM. >> OKAY. >> AND ALSO, BRIEFED THE FLIGHT OPERATIONS DIRECTORATE FOLKS THAT ARE IN CHARGE OF THE AIRCRAFT OUT AT ELLINGTON FIELD. >> OH, THAT’S RIGHT. >> WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO MOVE SOME OF THE AIRCRAFT. >> YEAH. >> MOST OF THEM REMAINED ON SITE BECAUSE IT WASN’T GOING TO BE A HIGH WIND EVENT. IT WAS MOSTLY GOING TO BE A HEAVY RAIN EVENT FROM HARVEY AROUND HERE. SO MOST OF THOSE PLANES WERE LEFT THERE. A FEW OF THEM FLEW OUT. >> YEAH. >> SO A LOT OF FOLKS ON SITE GOT BRIEFINGS ON THAT. DID THAT LEADING UP TO IT. OVER THE WEEKEND WHEN IT WAS RAINING AND NO ONE COULD GET INTO WORK, FORTUNATELY FOR ME, I WORKED REMOTELY. I HAD REMOTE ACCESS TO MY WEATHER SYSTEMS HERE ON SITE. >> OH, GOOD, YOU HAD A CONNECTION. >> I HAD A CONNECTION. >> YEAH. >> I COULD USE ALMOST EVERYTHING I COULD BY-- THAT I COULD USE WHEN I’M SITTING HERE. >> YEAH. >> NOT EVERYTHING, BUT PRETTY CLOSE TO IT. >> THAT’S GOOD. >> SO I WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE THE WEATHER BRIEFINGS AND SEND OUT THE JSC EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM MESSAGES FROM HOME. >> RIGHT. >> YEAH, SO THAT’S ONE UNIQUE WAY OF DOING-- WORKING FROM HOME, I GUESS. >> YEAH. NO, IT WAS COMPLETELY NECESSARY, RIGHT? BECAUSE EVERYONE NEEDED TO STAY SAFE DURING THAT WHOLE THING. >> YES. >> BUT, YOU HAVE INSTRUMENTATION THAT’S SPECIFIC TO JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, RIGHT? >> YES. >> SO WHEN YOU’RE LOOKING AT THIS DATA YOU CAN MAKE DECISIONS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT IT’S GOING TO IMPACT THIS EXACT AREA. ARE THERE INSTRUMENTS THAT KIND OF DO THE SAME THING ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, TOO? >> OH, YEAH. >> YEAH. >> YEAH. >> YEAH. >> THE NICE THING ABOUT JSC AND ESPECIALLY HARRIS COUNTY, THE COUNTY OFFICIALS HERE AROUND HOUSTON THEY MAINTAIN A  REALLY DENSE NETWORK OF RAIN GAUGES AND STREAM GAUGES SO THEY KNOW HOW MUCH RAIN’S FALLING. IT’S THE HARRIS COUNTY FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT. >> OKAY. >> THEY’RE REALLY GOOD AT THEIR JOB TOO, BY THE WAY. >> YEAH. >> AND SO, YOU REALLY GOT A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHERE IT’S FLOODING AND HOW HARD THE RAIN’S COMING DOWN JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA AROUND HERE. >> WOW. >> YEAH. >> ALL RIGHT. WELL, COMPLETELY NECESSARY FOR HOUSTON, TEXAS. >> YES, IT IS. IT FLOODS A LOT HERE. WHEN IT RAINS IT RAINS A LOT. I LEARNED THAT WHEN I MOVED DOWN HERE. >> YEAH. >> ANY BIG LESSONS THAT YOU LEARNED OR SOME JUST FASCINATING FINDINGS FROM THIS RECORD SETTING STORM? >> JUST HOW MUCH IT RAINED! >> YEAH. >> THE ODD THING WAS, WE HAD FORECAST GUIDANCE THAT SUGGESTED IT COULD BE THAT HIGH, BUT NO ONE QUITE BELIEVED IT WAS GOING TO BE THAT MUCH. >> RIGHT. >> OF COURSE, WHEN YOU’RE TELLING SOMEBODY IT’S GOING TO RAIN 20 INCHES IN A COUPLE OF DAYS, THAT’S STILL REALLY, REALLY, REALLY BAD. >> YEAH. >> BUT TO SEE 40 AND UPWARDS OF-- A FEW REPORTS OF OVER 50 INCHES IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA, THAT WAS JUST TRULY AMAZING. >> OH, THAT’S RIGHT, BECAUSE THE 40 WAS JUST AT JOHNSON SPACE CENTER. >> YES. >> YEAH, THAT’S NOT EVEN CONSIDERING OTHER PLACES. >> AND THE SHEER GEOGRAPHIC EXTENT OF THE 30-PLUS INCHES RAINFALL AMOUNTS IS MIND BOGGLING. >> YEAH. >> AND I SAW SOME REPORTS FROM SOME GPS SENSORS THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE WATER ENOUGH WAS MEASURABLE IN THE AMOUNT THAT IT SUNK THE EARTH FOR A FEW DAYS FROM THE WATER RISING. >> RIGHT. >> RESIDING ON TOP. IT WAS-- >> THE ELEVATED [ INDISTINCT ] OF HOUSTON WENT DOWN BY LIKE A CENTIMETER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. >> YEAH. > YEAH. > YEAH, THAT’S JUST MIND BOGGLING. >> YEAH. >> TO USE THAT WORD AGAIN. >> RIGHT. HOW MANY-- WHAT WAS THE-- WHAT-- I DON’T-- I FORGET THE NUMBER OF GALLONS. IT WAS 50 TRILLION, OR SOMETHING? >> IT’S A HUGE AMOUNT. >> YEAH, IT WAS. >> YOU COULDN’T DRINK IT, I KNOW THAT. >> OH, MAN. IT WAS A LOT THOUGH. WHAT ARE WE LEARNING ABOUT HURRICANES AND HOW THEY AFFECT MISSION OPERATIONS? SO WHAT’S THE BACKUP PLAN IF-- I GUESS THE PLAN RIGHT HERE WAS FOR THE FLIGHT CONTROLLERS IN-- >> THE REMAINED IN PLACE. >> THE REMAINED IN PLACE, RIGHT? >> YEAH. >> AND THEY WERE DOING EVERYTHING. NOBODY LEAVES. THEY SET UP COTS AND EVERYTHING, RIGHT? >> YES, THEY DID-- THEY DID, LARGELY BECAUSE WE EXPECTED IT TO BE A HEAVY RAIN EVENT. >> YEAH. >> IF IT HAD BEEN MORE OF A STRONGER STORM-- IF HARVEY WOULD’VE COME ASHORE AROUND HOUSTON INSTEAD OF DOWN NEAR ROCKPORT AND CORPUS CHRISTI, WE PROBABLY WOULD’VE SHUT THE CENTER DOWN COMPLETELY AND THEY WOULD’VE RELOCATED. >> OH. >> BECAUSE IN THAT CASE, IT’D BEEN A HIGH WIND EVENT AS WELL. BECAUSE IT CAME ASHORE AS A CATEGORY 4 HURRICANE, I BELIEVE. >> YEAH. >> AND YOU WOULD’VE HAD SOME STORM SURGE PROBLEMS AS WELL. YOU KNOW, YOU WOULD’VE HAD WATER PUSHED UP INTO GALVESTON BAY AND THAT WOULD’VE GOTTEN INTO CLEAR CREEK AND WATER WOULD’VE COME ON SITE. >> HUH. >> NOW, THE SITE DOES HAVE SOME MEASURES TO PROTECT SOME OF THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FROM STORM SURGE, BUT YOU’D BE LOSING POWER, YOU’D HAVE TO BE ON BACKUP POWER. AND THEN, EVEN THEN YOUR BACKUP POWER IT’S-- THE WATER LEVELS ROSE ENOUGH FROM THE STORM SURGE BEING PUSHED IN YOU COULD LOSE SOME OF YOUR GENERATORS WE WELL. >> OH, YEAH. >> THE INTERESTING THING IS IF YOU’VE EVER VISITED THE MISSION CONTROL CENTER, ESPECIALLY IN THE LOBBY, WHEN YOU WALK IN YOU’LL SEE SOME GATES THAT ARE LYING FLAT ON THE GROUND. THOSE ARE DESIGNED FOR A HURRICANE STORM SURGE. THEY’LL-- IF WE EXPECT A LARGE ENOUGH STORM OR A POWERFUL ENOUGH STORM, THEY’LL RAISE THOSE LITTLE GATES UP AND THAT’LL KEEP WATER FROM COMING INTO THE GROUND FLOOR OF THE BUILDING. >> OH, WOW. >> YEAH, YOU CAN SEE THOSE AS YOU WALK INTO THE LOBBY. THEY WERE PUT IN 5 TO 6 MAYBE 10 YEARS AGO. >> OKAY. >> BUT YEAH, SO THE BUILDING HAS GOT SOME PROTECTION FROM RISING WATERS. >> RIGHT. >> MOST OF THEM ARE DESIGNED FOR SOME DECENT WIND SPEEDS AS WELL I THINK. THE WEAKEST PART OF THE STRUCTURE THERE IS DESIGNED FOR 90 MILES AN HOUR. BUT THE MAIN PART OF THE MCC CAN WITHSTAND MUCH MORE THAN THAT, I THINK. >> WOW. ALL RIGHT, WELL, SOUNDS LIKE THEY HAVE A LOT OF PROTECTION JUST FOR THE BUILDING ITSELF, BUT THEN THERE’S BACKUP PLANS, RIGHT? >> YEAH. >> IN CASE-- IF THEY DO, FOR WHATEVER REASON, EVACUATE THE CENTER, JUST GET OUT, THEY CAN OPERATE THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION FROM REMOTE LOCATIONS, RIGHT? >> YES, THEY CAN. THEY’VE GOT A COMPLETE WAY OF DOING IT FROM HOTELS. >> YEAH. >> AS I UNDERSTAND. >> WOW. >> THEY CAN MOVE FURTHER INLAND HERE IN TEXAS AND DO MOST OF THE CONTROLS REMOTELY. THEY’LL SET THAT UP AND THEY’LL BE IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH MARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT CENTER AT THE HOSC OVER THERE. >> MM-HMM. >> AND THEN IN CONTACT WITH THE RUSSIAN CONTROL ROOM AS WELL. >> MM-HMM. >> SO THEY CAN-- IN CERTAIN THINGS THAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL. THEY COULD STILL PASS OFF TO EITHER-- TO THE RUSSIAN CONTROL ROOM OR TO THE HOSC AS WELL. BUT I THINK NEARLY EVERYTHING THEY CAN CONTROL REMOTELY. THEY’LL TAKE A WHOLE BUNCH OF LAPTOPS AND SEND PEOPLE OUT AND RUN IT SOMEWHERE DEEP IN SOUTH TEXAS OR CENTRAL TEXAS. >> WOW. JUST HURRICANES IN GENERAL AND HOW THEY AFFECT THE COAST, JUST THESE PAST HURRICANES OVER JUST 2017, INCLUDING MARIA AND ALL THESE THAT SWEPT BY, I’M SURE THE NOAA-- THE GOES-16 SATELLITE WAS CHECKING OUT SOME DATA THERE, BUT IS THERE SOME SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS THAT WE FOUND FROM SOME OF THE HURRICANES THIS YEAR? >> WELL, THERE WAS A LOT OF THEM. >> YEAH, YEAH. >> I THINK THAT’LL WAIT UNTIL THE SEASON’S OVER TO ANALYZE SOME OF THE DATA. >> I SEE. >> ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS THEY’VE DONE A LOT THIS YEAR THOUGH IS A COMBINATION BETWEEN THE NOAA AND NASA. NASA’S BEEN FLYING SOME UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES AROUND HURRICANES AND ABOVE THEM, AND THEY’RE DROPPING WHAT’S CALLED A DROPSON. IT’S ESSENTIALLY A WEATHER BALLOON IN REVERSE. IT’S ON A PARACHUTE. AND THE UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE, IT CAN DROP LIKE 60 TO 100 OF THESE LITTLE THINGS AROUND THE STORM AND BE UP THERE IN THE AIR AROUND IT FOR 12 TO 24 HOURS. SO YOU CAN COLLECT LOTS AND LOTS OF DATA ON THE IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING THE HURRICANE SO YOU KNOW WHAT IS STEERING IT AROUND. >> YEAH. >> SO THERE’S A LOT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES BEING FLOWN BY NASA AND BY NOAA OUT THERE. NOW I THINK SOME OF THAT WILL HELP US GET DATA INTO OUR COMPUTER MODELS AND MAKE BETTER FORECASTS IN THE FUTURE FOR HURRICANES. >> RIGHT. A LOT OF TECHNOLOGIES TO MEASURE, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS. BUT, HAS THERE BEEN ENGINEERING CHALLENGES OR MAYBE MILESTONES TO COUNTER-- BECAUSE YOU SAID-- YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT-- YOU SAID IT WAS APOLLO 12 THAT GOT STRUCK BY LIGHTNING? >> YES. >> BUT IT KEPT GOING, RIGHT? >> YES. >> SO AND I KNOW THAT I THINK THEY HAD TO FIX SOME THINGS ONCE THEY WERE UP THERE. >> YES, THEY DID. >> YEAH. BUT, WHAT KINDS OF ENGINEERING THINGS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO PROTECT FROM WEATHER? >> A LOT OF THAT’S BEEN PROCEDURAL. >> OH, OKAY. >> A LOT OF IT’S-- YOU GO TO A LOT OF MEETINGS HERE AT NASA AND YOU’LL HEAR ABOUT THE INTEGRATED VEHICLE, MAKING SURE THE LEFT HAND KNOWS WHAT THE RIGHT HAND IS DOING. >> OH. >> SO IF YOU’RE PROTECTED FROM LIGHTNING HERE BUT YOU’RE NOT PROTECTED FOR LIGHTNING OVER HERE, WHAT HAPPENS IF THIS PARTS GETS STRUCK AND IT GETS OVER THROUGH ANOTHER MEANS. >> OH, YEAH. >> SO IT’S PULLING TOGETHER EVERYTHING AS A WHOLE IN TERMS OF THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT-- LIGHTNING, OR WINDS, OR WHATEVER. A LOT OF THAT’S BEEN PROCEDURAL NOW. THERE’S A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN DO NOW TO HARDEN THINGS AGAINST LIGHTNING, BUT THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF TECHNOLOGIES THE EXACT OPPOSITE AS WELL. A LOT OF AIRPLANES USED TO BE MADE OUT OF METAL SKINS. WHEN LIGHTNING WOULD TRICK THE OUTSIDE IT WOULD CONDUCT AROUND THE OUTSIDE, MORE AND MORE COMPOSITE MATERIALS NOW. >> AH. >> THEY DIFFERENTLY THAN METAL. SO A LOT OF ENGINEERING’S GOT TO GO INTO LOOKING AT WHEN YOU USE COMPOSITES, HOW CAN YOU TREAT THAT FOR LIGHTNING STRIKES THAT MIGHT OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. >> OKAY. >> THERE’S LOTS OF LITTLE THINGS THAT YOU-- IT TRICKLES DOWN TO. >> YEAH. A LOT OF THE DATA, A LOT OF THE INSTRUMENTS MEASURE WIND TOO AND WIND SEEMS TO BE JUST A GIANT CONSIDERATION FOR SPACEFLIGHT IN GENERAL. >> YEAH. >> WHICH MAKES SENSE, RIGHT? >> MM-HMM. >> YOU HAVE THINGS GOING UP INTO SPACE AND COMING DOWN FROM SPACE AND WIND’S GOING TO BLOW IT. BUT, ARE THERE WAYS TO SORT OF FIGHT THAT? IS THERE-- I GUESS, TRY TO MAKE IT SO IF YOU’RE GOING TO LAND THERE’S-- YOU HAVE THE BEST CHANCE OF LANDING WHERE YOU WANT TO REGARDLESS OF WIND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? >> A LOT OF THAT’S MONITORING. >> MONITORING. >> EITHER WITH WEATHER BALLOONS AND WE USE RADAR WIND PROFILERS NOW. >> OH, OKAY. >> YOU CAN ESSENTIALLY TAKE A PHASED ARRAY RADAR AND POINT IT STRAIGHT UP. YOU CAN GET WIND MEASUREMENTS FROM THAT, EVEN IN CLEAR AIR. >> AH. >> AND THERE’S ONE OF THOSE THAT’S OPERATED OUT OF THE KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, REALLY LARGE ONES. THE ANTENNA’S A BUNCH OF WIRES LAYING OUT IN A FIELD. AND IT MEASURES WINDS UP TO 60,000 FEET AND YOU GET SOME ABOUT EVERY FIVE TO SIX MINUTES. >> HMM. >> WHICH IS REALLY, REALLY FREQUENT. >> YEAH. >> SO IF YOU DESIGN THINGS FOR YOUR TRAJECTORY-- THE WAY THINGS ARE STILL DONE TODAY IN LARGE PART IS YOU MEASURE THE WINDS AND YOU KNOW FROM PAST EXPERIENCE HOW MUCH THEY CHANGE IN TWO HOURS AND FOUR HOURS, AND YOU PROTECT AGAINST THAT STATISTICALLY. BUT, IF YOU CAN PUSH THAT FURTHER AND FURTHER TO LAUNCH TIME BECAUSE YOU CAN MEASURE IT MORE FREQUENTLY YOU CAN SAVE A LOT OF LAUNCHES BECAUSE YOU CAN SAY, “OH, WELL, I’M PROTECTING WAY TOO MUCH HERE, OR I’M NOT PROTECTING ENOUGH BECAUSE I CAN SEE CHANGES THAT ARE ARRIVING.” >> AH. >> WITH A WEATHER BALLOON YOU’D HAVE TO RELEASE IT, AND FOR ONE THING, IT’S BLOWING DOWN RANGE. IT'S NOT DIRECTLY OVERHEAD. >> YEAH. >> SO IF THE WINDS ARE HIGH AND HOUR INTO THE FLIGHT THE BALLOON COULD BE 50, 60 MILES AWAY, AND THAT’S WHERE YOU’RE REALLY MEASURING THE WIND INSTEAD OF LIKE OVERHEAD. >> WHERE YOU NEED TO. >> WITH A PROFILER, IT’S PRETTY MUCH STRAIGHT OVERHEAD. >> OKAY. >> AIRCRAFT CAN MEASURE WINDS AS WELL. >> MM-HMM. >> EVEN THE SATELLITES, YOU CAN TRACK CLOUD ELEMENTS AND YOU CAN GET AN IDEA WHAT THE WIND SPEEDS ARE AT CERTAIN HEIGHTS AS WELL. >> RIGHT. >> THERE’S A LOT OF WAYS TO DO THAT. AND EVEN THE USUAL RADARS THAT WE USE FOR WEATHER TO DETECT CLOUDS AND STORMS IN MOTION. >> YEAH. >> THEY’LL MEASURE WINDS AS WELL. >> WOW. >> THERE’S A LOT OF WAYS TO DO IT NOW. >> IS THERE OTHER PARTS OF THE ECONOMY WHERE ALL OF THIS DATA IS BEING BROUGHT INTO? I’M SURE THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY MUST HAVE SOME, RIGHT? >> OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. THERE’S A LARGE PRIVATE WEATHER INDUSTRY OUT THERE. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON’T KNOW ABOUT IT. MOST PEOPLE THINK THERE’S ONLY TWO, WELL, MAYBE THREE THINGS IN WEATHER. THERE’S THE GUY I SEE ON TELEVISION. MOST FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION I ALWAYS GET WHEN I TELL THEM I’M A METEOROLOGIST IS, “WHAT CHANNEL DO YOU WORK ON?” >> YEAH. >> AND THEN, THE SECOND ONE IS, “OH, YOU WORK FOR THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE OR THE MILITARY.” >> MM-HMM. >> BECAUSE THEY EMPLOY A LOT-- OR YOU KNOW, “YOU TEACH.” >> OH, YOU TEACH. >> BUT, THERE’S A LARGE PRIVATE WEATHER INDUSTRY OUT THERE THAT TAILOR WEATHER INFORMATION TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES. A LOT OF THAT DOES WITH ENERGY TRADING. >> HMM. >> THEY’LL ADVISE. IF YOU’VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD IDEA THAT TWO WEEKS FROM NOW IT’S GOING TO BE MUCH COLDER THAN NORMAL IN THE NORTHEAST, YOU CAN GO OUT AND BUY A LOT OF FUEL OIL AND YOU TRADE THAT JUST LIKE ANYTHING. IT’S ANOTHER PIECE OF INFORMATION TO HELP YOU BUY FUTURES, FOR EXAMPLE. >> OKAY. >> THERE’S-- IT’S A  BIG SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY. THE MORE I LEARN ABOUT THAT THE MORE I’M AMAZED AT HOW LARGE IT IS. >> YEAH. >> THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, THEY WANT TO KNOW WHERE HAIL STORMS HAVE OCCURRED. >> OH, YEAH. >> TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY, OF COURSE-- MANY, MANY YEARS AGO I WORKED FOR A PRIVATE WEATHER FIRM. >> OKAY. THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY LOVED US. >> OH. >> IF THERE WAS A BIG SNOW STORM IN THE MIDWEST THEY COULD REROUTE ALL THEIR TRUCKS, DRIVE FURTHER SOUTH, AND THEY WOULDN’T GET STUCK FOR DAYS ON END. >> RIGHT. >> SO AND THEN OF COURSE IF YOU’VE EVER FLOWN ON AN AIRPLANE YOU’VE HAD A WEATHER DELAY. >> THAT’S RIGHT. IT’S PRETTY EXPANSIVE. BECAUSE WEATHER AFFECTS-- I GUESS YOU COULD SAY WEATHER AFFECTS EVERYONE. >> JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY. >> YEAH, HOW ABOUT THAT. AWESOME. SO WHAT’S YOUR BACKGROUND? HOW DID YOU GET TO GO INTO METEOROLOGY AND HOW DID YOU END UP IN SPACEFLIGHT? >> WELL, IT’S INTERESTING THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE I’VE THAT ARE METEOROLOGISTS, THERE’S ONLY GENERALLY TWO KINDS OF THOSE. NOT COMPLETELY TRUE, BUT-- THERE’S THOSE THAT, “WELL, I WAS IN THE MILITARY AND I HAD A MATH AND PHYSICS BACKGROUND. THEY MADE ME ONE.” >> OH. >> AND THEN THERE’S THE, “THAT’S ALL I EVER WANTED TO DO.” WELL, I’M ONE OF THAT, THAT’S ALL I EVER WANTED TO DO. >> OH, COOL. >> EVER SINCE I WAS A CHILD, THAT’S THE ONLY THING I EVER WANTED TO DO. >> COOL. >> AND FORTUNATELY, I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT. >> YEAH. >> AND I THINK IT WAS LARGELY-- I GREW UP IN OKLAHOMA, SO YOU’RE WORRIED ABOUT TORNADOS. >> OH, YEAH. >> WELL, I TAKE THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THAT WAS GROWING UP IN OKLAHOMA AS A CHILD, WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA, STUDIES METEOROLOGY, NEVER SAW A TORNADO. >> REALLY? >> NEVER. >> I WAS WAITING FOR A GOOD TORNADO STORY TO SAY THAT’S WHAT INSPIRED YOU. >> WELL, THEN-- WELL, BEING SCARED BY THEM, THAT WAS PART OF THE DEAL THAT MADE ME DO THAT. >> OH, SURE. >> BUT MY FIRST JOB AT THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE, I WAS STATIONED IN AMARILLO, TEXAS, AND WE GOT A RADAR INDICATION OF A TORNADO. >> HUH. >> SO WE ISSUED A TORNADO WARNING FOR THE COUNTY WE WERE IN, AND SOMEBODY LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AND GOES, “HEY, THERE IT IS.” SO THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE I SAW. >> WAS IN AMARILLO, TEXAS. >> YEAH, WAS IN AMARILLO. THE SECOND ONE WAS A WATERSPOUT AT GALVESTON BAY, WHICH WE SEE FROM TIME TO TIME. >> OH, OKAY. >> YEAH. >> MATTER OF FACT, JUST THIS SUMMER SOMEONE SENT A PICTURE TO ME OF ALONGSIDE OF A WATERSPOUT OVER CLEAR LAKE. >> WHAT? >> YEAH. >> I’VE GOT SEVERAL PICTURES OF WATERSPOUTS FROM OVER GALVESTON BAY AND CLEAR LAKE THAT ARE NEARBY US OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. >> OH, MAN, CLOSE TO HOME. >> SINCE 2000, WE’VE HAD FIVE MAYBE 6 OF THEM WE’VE SEEN FROM JSC. >> FIVE MAYBE SIX IN THE PAST 17 YEARS? OKAY. >> YEAH. SO IT’S NOT ENTIRELY UNCOMMON. >> OKAY. >> BUT, IT’S NOT COMMON EITHER. >> RIGHT. >> BUT YEAH, SO WE DO HAVE THEM HERE AS WELL. >> HMM. >> SO THAT’S WHAT GOT ME INTERESTED INTO IT. I WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA, STUDIED METEOROLOGY. WE’RE WELL KNOWN FOR SEVERE STORMS. THEN, WORKED FOR A PRIVATE WEATHER COMPANY FOR A WHILE, THEN JOINED THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE, AND SAW AN OPENING FOR TECHNIQUES DEVELOPMENT METEOROLOGIST AT THE SPACEFLIGHT METEOROLOGY GROUP. DIDN’T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. NEVER HEARD OF IT. >> YEAH. >> SO I APPLIED. SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE I MUST’VE GOT THE APPLICATIONS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN AND THEY HIRED ME. AND I CAME IN AS A TECHNIQUE'S DEVELOPMENT METEOROLOGIST, WHICH MEANT I WAS DEVELOPING FORECAST TECHNIQUES AND WORKED WITH THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS TO MAKE THEM FRIENDLIER FOR THE LEAD FORECASTERS WHO DID THE ACTUAL FORECASTING FOR THE LAUNCHES AND THE-- OR FOR THE ABORT LANDINGS AND FOR THE END OF MISSION LANDINGS FOR THE SPACE SHUTTLE. AND ABOUT A YEAR AND HALF INTO THAT I WAS PROMOTED TO BE ONE OF THE LEAD FORECASTERS, AND SINCE THEN I’VE GROWN UP TO BE THE METEOROLOGIST IN CHARGE. >> ALL RIGHT. >> I’VE GONE FROM THE GROUND FLOOR TO THE PENTHOUSE ALL AT SMG. >> VERY COOL. SO HOW HAS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY CHANGED FROM WHEN YOU FIRST CAME HERE AND YOU SAID YOU WERE WORKING 90-SOMETHING SHUTTLES LAUNCHES. >> NINETY-TWO MISSIONS. >> NINETY-TWO SHUTTLE MISSIONS TO METEOROLOGIST IN CHARGE. >> WELL, GIVEN THE CURRENT STAFFING, I’M THE METEOROLOGIST IN CHARGE OF MYSELF. THE SIZE OF THE OFFICE HAS WAXED AND WANED WITH THE AMOUNT OF FLIGHTS WE’VE GOT GOING. >> I SEE. >> SO FOR RIGHT NOW, I’M DOING EVERYTHING. >> OH, WOW. >> SO THAT’S-- SO I MANAGE THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS, I’M THE PROPERTY CUSTODIAN, NEVER A GOOD JOB TO HAVE. AND SO, I DO ALL OF THE FORECASTING OUT FOR ALL THE PROJECTS AND TESTS THAT WE’RE SUPPORTING. I’M PRETTY MUCH DOING EVERYTHING NOW, SO I’VE LEARNED A LOT OF MANAGEMENT SIDE OF THINGS. >> YEAH. >> AND HOPEFULLY SOONER OR LATER THE OFFICE WILL EXPAND AGAIN BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF FLIGHTS WE’LL HAVE AND PROGRAMS WE’RE SUPPORTING. THAT’S REALLY STARTING TO RAMP UP NOW. WE’RE DOING MORE AND MORE TEST SUPPORT, QUALIFICATION TESTS, AND THE ACTUAL LAUNCHES AND LANDINGS AREN'T TOO FAR AWAY NOW SO WE’LL NEED SOME EXTRA PEOPLE THAT-- >> OH, THAT’S RIGHT. >> IT WON’T BE AS MANY AS THE SHUTTLE. THE NEW VEHICLES ARE LESS WEATHER SENSITIVE THAN THE SHUTTLE, THAT’S ONE THING I’VE NOTICED SO FAR. AND THAT’S A GOOD THING. >> OH, YEAH. THAT’S VERY TRUE. SO HAVE YOU GONE OUT TO SOME OF THE TESTS TO SEE HOW EVERYTHING’S WORKING? >> YES, I HAVE. >> OH, OKAY. >> I’VE BEEN OUT TO SEE ONE OF THE PARACHUTE QUALIFICATION TESTS FOR THE ORION CAPSULE. >> OKAY. >> OUT OF YUMA PROVING GROUNDS. WE WERE VERY, VERY CLOSE TO THE ACTION. >> YEAH. >> ENOUGH SO THAT SOMEONE DROVE BY AND SAID, “ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE HERE?” SO I SAID, “YEAH.” THE WEATHER CHECK IS REALLY, REALLY CLOSE. >> WOW. >> BECAUSE THEY’RE RELEASING WEATHER BALLOONS FOR THE-- TO MEASURE THE UPPER WINDS. >> YEAH, THIS IS IN YUMA, UTAH, RIGHT? >> YEAH, YUMA, ARIZONA. >> OH, ARIZONA. >> YUP. >> OKAY, OKAY. >> THE FUNNY THING I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT THOUGH WAS I HAD PARKED A RENTAL CAR THERE AND I SEE CAPSULE COMING DOWN WITH THE PARACHUTES AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT’S REALLY CLOSE. >> YEAH. >> AND MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS, “IT’S GOING TO-- HOW AM I GOING TO EXPLAIN TO THE RENTAL CAR COMPANY A SPACESHIP FEEL ON THE CAR?” FORTUNATELY, THAT DIDN’T HAPPEN. >> YEAH. DID YOU GET THE SPACESHIP INSURANCE THOUGH WHEN YOU CHECKED IT OUT? >> NO, I DID NOT GET THAT, NO. >> OKAY. >> AND I’VE BEEN OUT ON BOARD SOME OF THE NAVY SHIPS THAT WE USED TO RECOVER THE EFT-1 FLIGHT, THAT SPACE CAPSULE FROM-- >> OH. >> YEAH, SO I WAS THE FORECASTER FOR THAT MISSION AS WELL HERE AT JSC. >> YEAH, THAT WAS OUT-- DID IT LAND IN THE PACIFIC? >> LANDED OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN, ABOUT 600, 700 MILES SOUTHWEST OF BAJA, CALIFORNIA. >> ALL RIGHT. >> OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. NOT FAR FROM WHERE SHARKS LIKE TO HANG OUT, FOR SOME REASON. >> OH. >> THE OCEANOGRAPHIC THINGS I LEARNED ABOUT THE MISSION. BUT YEAH, I GOT TO GO OUT ON BOARD THAT SHIP AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE WANTED TO PLACE SOME SPECIAL WEATHER EQUIPMENT ON BOARD. >> OKAY. >> WE ENDED UP PUTTING IT RIGHT NEAR THE-- RIGHT ABOVE THE HANGAR ON THE BACK OF THE SHIP, SO IT WORKED OUT PRETTY WELL. THE NAVY’S PRETTY HANDY WITH THEIR STUFF. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY’RE DOING OUT THERE. >> ALL RIGHT. >> ONE THING-- UNIQUE THING ABOUT THAT IS FOR THINGS THAT SPLASH DOWN, YOU SEND THE PEOPLE AND EQUIPMENT OUT, IF SOMETHING BREAKS YOU CAN’T GO TO THE STORE TO BUY SOMETHING. IT’S GOT TO BE WITH YOU. SO YOU GOT TO PLAN FOR EVERY LAST CONTINGENCY WHILE YOU’RE OUT THERE. >> OH, WOW. >> YEAH. >> YEAH. >> SO, DID YOU ENCOUNTER LIKE A FAILURE THAT YOU HAD TO KIND OF DEAL WITH? OR YOU WERE PREPARED? >> WE WERE PRETTY WELL PREPARED. >> COOL. >> WE HAD A METEOROLOGICAL-- METEOROLOGIST FROM YUMA GO OUT AND RELEASE THE BALLOONS FROM THE SHIP FOR US. >> OKAY. >> AND ONE OF THE THINGS HE LEARNED WAS YOU CAN’T TAKE LITHIUM BATTERIES OUT ON THE SHIP. >> AH. >> THEY DON’T LIKE THOSE ON THE AIRPLANES EITHER ANYMORE. >> YEAH, RIGHT. >> AND HE HAD AN EXTENSION CORD WHICH DIDN’T MEET STANDARDS. >> OH. >> FORTUNATELY, THEY LOAN YOU ONE, SO WE LEARNED QUITE A BIT FROM THAT. >> OKAY. >> AND WE’LL BE ABLE TO USE FOR FUTURE ORION AS WELL. >> YEAH. TAKE THAT ALL WITH YOU. AWESOME. ALL RIGHT, WELL, I THINK WILL ABOUT WRAP IT UP FOR TODAY. I KNOW I HAVE A LOT MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT WEATHER AND CLIMATE AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF, BUT I GUESS WE’LL JUST SAVE IT FOR ANOTHER TIME. BUT HEY, TIM, THANKS FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. THIS WAS REALLY JUST EYE OPENING ABOUT JUST THE WORLD OF WEATHER AND HOW IT AFFECTS HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT AND JUST THE OPERATIONS HERE AT THE CENTER, TOO, BUT JUST ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD JOB. I KNOW YOU’RE DOING EVERYTHING, BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU’RE DOING EVERYTHING SO THAT’S KIND OF COOL. >> IT IS A GOOD JOB AND THE MORE YOU LEARN ABOUT WEATHER THE MORE YOU LEARN IT IMPACTS EVERYTHING. >> THAT’S RIGHT. OKAY, WELL, TIM, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING ON THE SHOW. >> YOU BET. [ MUSIC ] >> HOUSTON, GO AHEAD. >> TOP OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE. >> ROGER, ZERO-G AND I FEEL FINE. >> SHUTTLE HAS CLEARED THE TOWER. >> WE CAME IN PEACE FOR ALL MANKIND. >> IT’S ACTUALLY A HUGE HONOR TO BREAK THE RECORD LIKE THIS. >> NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY, BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD. >> HOUSTON, WELCOME TO SPACE. >> HEY, THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND. SO TODAY, WE TALKED ABOUT WEATHER AND HOW IT AFFECTS HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT WITH TIM GARNER, THE METEOROLOGIST IN CHARGE HERE AT THE NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER. SO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT’S GOING ON HERE AT THE CENTER, NASA.GOV/JOHNSON IS A GREAT RESOURCE FOR EVERYTHING NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER. OBVIOUSLY, WE HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS FOR THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER-- FACEBOOK, TWITTER, AND INSTAGRAM. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION OR COMMERCIAL CREW PROGRAMS AND WHAT’S GOING ON, WE KIND OF ALLUDED TO SOME OF THE DEVELOPMENTS GOING ON IN THE COMMERCIAL CREW PROGRAM ESPECIALLY. SOON WE’RE GOING TO BE LAUNCHING IN AMERICA, SO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT’S GOING ON THERE JUST GO TO NASA.GOV/COMMERCIALCREW, NASA.GOV/ISS IS ALSO A GOOD RESOURCE, AND OF COURSE ALL OF THOSE ARE ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER, AND INSTAGRAM AS WELL. IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION, JUST USE THE HASHTAG #ASKNASA ON YOUR FAVORITE PLATFORM. IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE WEATHER, WE CAN ANSWER IT IN A LATER PODCAST LIKE WE’VE DONE BEFORE. OF IF YOU HAVE A SUGGESTION FOR A TOPIC THAT YOU REALLY WANT US TO COVER, JUST LET US KNOW USING THAT HASHTAG AND JUST MAKE SURE TO USE HWHAP, H-W-H-A-P IN THAT POST SO I CAN FIND IT AND THEN WE CAN MAKE AN EPISODE ON IT. AND FOR EVERYONE SO FAR WHO HAS SUBMITTED SOME IDEAS, THANKS SO MUCH BECAUSE WE’VE ACTUALLY BEEN LOOKING AT THEM AND HAVE ALREADY MADE SOME EPISODES DEDICATED TO SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERED THEM. SO THANKS AGAIN. THIS PODCAST WAS RECORDED ON OCTOBER 25th, 2017. THANKS TO ALEX PERRYMAN, JOHN STOLL, AND JENNY KNOTTS FOR HELPING OUT WITH THE EPISODE. THANKS AGAIN TO MR. TIM GARNER FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. WE’LL BE BACK NEXT WEEK.",

        description: "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 171, “Orion Today.” I'm Pat Ryan. On this podcast, we talk with scientists, engineers, astronauts, and all kinds of experts about their part in America's space exploration program, and today, we're checking in on the development of the vehicle that will take men and women farther away from Earth than they have ever gone. It's called Orion, and as the program puts it on its website, \"For the first time in a generation, NASA is building a human spacecraft for deep space missions that will usher in a new era of space exploration.\" That includes going back to the Moon in just a few years. Yep, this is the spaceship to make that trip, and we've talked about various aspects of Orion and its systems here on the podcast over the past three years. Today we get an update. Orion Deputy Program Manager, Howard Hu, has bachelor's and master's degrees in aeronautical and astronautical engineering. He worked in the space shuttle and International Space Station programs before joining Orion in 2007, and since then, he has worked on the vehicle's avionics and power and software systems, on guidance navigation and control. He really knows this thing inside and out, and I got to spend an hour asking all the so-called “stupid questions,” so you don't have to. Time to find out the latest about Orion. Here we go.  [ Music]  Host: I learned a long time ago in high school that all good arguments begin by defining your terms. So, you've been involved in Orion for years. Howard Hu, what is Orion?  Howard Hu: Well, Orion is our next generation exploration spaceship, or spacecraft. It is an exciting time for us at NASA certainly. We're looking for lunar exploration and beyond, and Orion will take us there. And Orion's comprised of really of three elements, three major elements. So the crew, I’ll start in the middle, which is the heart, which is where the crew sits, is the crew module, and four crew members will be able to sit in that crew module, and behind it is the service module, and it provides the major propulsion systems, the major power generation capabilities, and it also stores the water and oxygen that a crew needs for the exploration missions, and of course, very unique, you'll see a Launch Abort System, which we put on top of the crew module and the service module, and that allows the crew to have abort capability when we launch from the pad, as we go into space. So, if anything happens with the rocket that is launched as a Space Launch System, SLS, launches us, there's issues with the rocket, or we have some issues and the crew needs to get off the spacecraft or the launch vehicle, then the Launch Abort System, or the LAS, will be able to pull the crew module away and land the crew safely. So, three major elements comprise of Orion. Only one really goes -- I mean, only two goes out in outer space, and of course, the Launch Abort System drops off when we head into deep space.  Host: And by deep space, we mean beyond Earth orbit? Does that mean just to the Moon, or even further than that?  Howard Hu: So, there's a term called low-Earth orbit, or LEO. So, that's where most of the current commercial space, and of course, International Space Station is at. Now when we talk about beyond LEO, you know, that's going to the Moon, and then, of course, as we learn our capabilities and we explore the lunar surface, and we utilize the lunar environment as a launching pad, then certainly, Orion will be a spacecraft that we would use to go onto Mars. Now it will not be the only element of, certainly, Mars exploration. You're going to need more modules and capability, because it's a much longer duration, right?   Host: Yes.  Howard Hu: Seven days or so, five to seven days of travel to the Moon and, you know, two years, maybe, return trip, depending on your orbit, to Mars. So, the durations are significantly different. So, but Orion will be a big part of that piece, as well, as we go to Mars, and certainly, the first steppingstone for any deep space exploration, I think, is our plan to go to the Moon and learn from there before we jump to a bigger step.  Host: Yeah, I think you raise a good point, and let me get you to expand on it a bit. There are -- we have spacecraft that are flying in low-Earth orbit right now. That's not what Orion is designed for. Can you compare it to the current vehicles and how does it differ, and what kind of capabilities does it have?  Howard Hu: Yeah, so, Pat, you know, when you go deeper into space, the time frame is a little different. You know, you may be able to return quickly from low-Earth orbit, or LEO. And so, your ability to respond to failures or issues on the spacecraft is going to be significantly different. So, for an exploration-class type of spacecraft, like Orion, you know, we protect for redundancy, but more than just redundancy, we protect for what we consider may be off nominal or lessons learned we have done in the past, for example, manual switches. You know, manual switches --  Host: You mean like throwing it and up and down?  Howard Hu: The actual manual switches, right? Certainly, we are very much in a computer age, and great software computers, but the reliability is certainly very high and that we would, you know, test and ensure that the systems are good. But we have learned in the past that sometimes manual switches, manual capabilities, are another additional step, a different type of redundancy, that you may need to critical systems, like separating from the spacecraft. So, when we come home, we need to separate the crew module from the service module.  Host: Right.  Howard Hu: And the crew module returns the crew back and lands safely on Earth. And so, that step, you know, we want to have an ability to, obviously, separate. Same with releasing the parachutes. So, you want to have different paths to allow you to have that redundancy.  Host: More than one way.  Howard Hu: That's more than just -- yeah, more than one way to do something, and that's one thing we've learned. The other things that you learn about when you go to deep space is, certainly, radiation has a big effect on the spacecraft. So, you want to be radiation tolerant. So, we're very dependent on electronics. And so, you have to have a very robust test program for that, as well. And then of course, you know, the harsh environment, as you go out to deep space, you do not have anybody else to count on but yourselves in the spacecraft. You want to ensure all your systems are tested very well, number one, and to a level that is beyond what you think it will operate in, or what we think the environment will be in. And so, that's very important from a spacecraft perspective. And then, the last thing is the ability for the crew to interact with the system. So, a lot of times, you can certainly for a shorter mission, like a LEO or low-Earth orbit mission, you know, you can sit back, and the automated system, it'll do everything, and it'll be fine. As I said, as you get further out from Earth and away from Earth, the crew sitting in a capsule needs to have more ability to interact with the system if the system doesn't do or behave a certain way, or something happens where the crew needs to intercede much quicker. So, those kinds of manual control capabilities and manual ability to intervene are very important, and that's designed in the system, as well.  Host: Pilot astronauts want to fly their ship. They don't want to be taken for a ride.  Howard Hu: Yeah, and certainly, you know, they will be taken for a ride. A lot of the systems are going to be great onboard, you know, in terms of letting the crew, you know, do other things, but when something happens, or when you see something happen, you want to make sure the crew member and their brains are getting to interact and understand the situation, along with the ground, but certainly, they are the first-line defense. Their lives are on the line, and you want to give them the tools for them to really understand what is happening and be able to respond quickly.  Host: You've raised a number of points I want to circle back to, but in your describing the ship, I mean, I've seen enough pictures of it to know that to me, it looks a lot like an Apollo spaceship. The first American crewed vehicle that went to the Moon. Was that an inspiration in the general design of this, as opposed to, and particular of systems, but the Apollo capsule that worked so well, was that something that the designers of Orion drew upon?  Howard Hu: Yeah, Pat, great question. You know, our predecessors were very smart, certainly as, you know, 51 years ago, we landed on the Moon. So, they had great engineering, great designs, and, you know, you want to leverage off of what their knowledge and what their experience was, and a capsule is very efficient to return through a very harsh environment of reentry into our Earth's atmosphere. So, when they designed that capsule, and they did a lot of work, they really understood the aerodynamics and the aerothermal behind something like that kind of blunt body shape. And certainly, that was not just an inspiration, but we had a lot of understanding and engineering data and information from that time period, obviously. And when we started looking at, at NASA, when we started looking at kind of the types of bodies that would be good to have those lunar reentry speeds or even return from Mars, what kind of speeds we would see when we reentered the atmosphere, a blunt body shape was a very good design from that standpoint.  Host: The bluntness here referring to the back end, the one that is leading through the atmosphere.  Howard Hu: Yeah, like a pear shaped, yeah, the bottom of it, the heat shield, is the blunt part of the body, and the ability for the spacecraft to be very efficient, to dissipate the heat when you reenter, is a really important thing, and if you remember, the shuttle had a little bit of wings, certainly not a lot, and we had to deal with a lot of tiles and things like that. Now that was a low-Earth return type of speed. So, it's certainly less than what you're seeing.  Host: You're saying that Orion's return will be at a higher rate of speed than the space shuttle was.  Howard Hu: Yeah, yes, yes, definitely. And so, that's the difference, number one, and certainly, when you say, inspiration, I mean, we learned a lot from our predecessors. We're taking advantage of that knowledge and applying it for future space exploration.  Host: How long has it been since Orion was -- the idea came to build this vehicle?  Howard Hu: Boy, it started in the 2004-2005 timeframe when, you know, President Bush announced the vision for space exploration.  Host: Right, right.  Howard Hu: And the genesis of, hey, we want to return and build spacecraft that would go beyond low-Earth orbit. And so, that started formulating, but in our current program, the Artemis Program, you know, we've been working on it for several years, and certainly, the changing dynamics of kind of the direction where we're going has evolved a little bit. You know, we were going to an asteroid at one time, but now, you know, we're very focused on the Artemis missions of returning the first woman and the next man back on the lunar surface. So, very important national goals that have been called together over the last few years.  Host: So, Orion has been part of the agency's effort even as the specific direction of that effort has changed over the course of more than 10 years now.  Howard Hu: Yeah, I think that's the flexibility of the spacecraft, right? The mission, the ultimate end goal of the mission may change or evolve, but certainly, the requirement to carry the crew to those destinations, whether it be the lunar orbit, whether it be an asteroid or something different, you know, is the same relative to making sure that the crew has an environment that they can safely live in, that we can return them back to Earth safely, and that they can be transported from, obviously, lift off all the way to their destination. So --  Host: You've been part of the program for a long time, too, haven't you? Tell me about your work in the Orion program.  Howard Hu:  Yeah, I've been very fortunate, you know, to be with the program since the very beginning. You know, I've had opportunity to work on a lot of different things. You know, I started as the guidance navigation control lead for the program. So, the flying of the vehicle, the navigating of the vehicle. So, very important things, that certainly, I was very fortunate to be part of. And then, I've had opportunities to move up in leadership in the program, you know, both managing the overall vehicle integration and helping lead that. And then, prior to becoming the acting program manager, the deputy program manager, you know, I was responsible for all the avionics power and software on the vehicle. So, I've been able to touch lots of big areas on the spacecraft. I was fortunate to see a lot of different things and be part of a lot of the successes we've had so far. So, really happy to be here and contribute.  Host: I understand you worked in other programs here even before Orion. So, your background in human spaceflight goes back even further, right?  Howard Hu: Yeah, I may not -- maybe I shouldn't tell how old I am, but certainly, I've had a lot of years at NASA. I was very fortunate, like I said, you know, not to be only in Orion, but I started my career in the International Space Station at the very beginning. Saw the first, worked through the first few elements of the International Space Station, and then, I was able to work on the upgrades to the space shuttle. And so, I was able to touch on our two major human spaceflight programs. Saw a lot of, not only, the beginning of the International Space Station, but the operational vehicle and trying to upgrade an operational vehicle like the space shuttle. And then, of course, that I came onto Orion and deep space exploration.  Host: Let's talk about Orion in some more of the details, in the different things. When you get to talk to people about Orion, what do you find to be the highlights that people get very excited about when you describe these aspects of the vehicle?  Howard Hu: Yeah, you know, I think a broad spectrum of things, when we talk about excitement first, you know, when I think about Orion or talk to people of Orion, you know, we're building a long-term space exploration vehicle, you know, a vehicle that can evolve, number one, but also support the missions in a long-term, not just the one mission or two-mission type of vehicle, but we're really looking at the long-term for NASA and space exploration. So, that's really exciting. So, not only are we trying to fly as soon as we can, but we're also looking at the long-term of what we can do as a spacecraft capability, but also to try to manage our costs, so that it's affordable long-term and that we can do a lot of different things for exploration. So, that, at a global level, is very exciting.   Host: Yeah.  Howard Hu: I think the second thing is just the technologies that we're embedding into the spacecraft relative to how the crew engages. You know, we are really advancing the next generation of crew interaction with the systems, not through displays, through controls, how we do automation. How does the human interact with the automated system? What are things like I talked to you about earlier, relative to, you know, crew interaction, crew manual control, crew engagement in certain problems, how we do those things where today we can rely a lot on automated systems, software. We live in a software, you know, computer age, right?  Host: Sure.  Howard Hu: So, but to blend that human piece in is really a new thing, a new thing relative to what we've done in the past, and I think that's really exciting going forward, and then, of course, we're doing a few things differently relative to battery technology, navigation technology. So, those are really exciting things I've talked to people about where we're advancing that state-of-the-art with, you know, the commercial providers, as well, because that's what we're going to need in the future, because communication is very important when you're further out and even further out to Mars, right? So, one of the things, you know, we're doing is looking at those communication technologies, and of course, you know, docking with the vehicle, rendezvous with other spacecraft, is going to be very important in space. And so, we're advancing those kinds of navigation sensors, what we call relative navigation sensors. So, everybody's heard about GPS.  Host: Right.  Howard Hu: We use it every day, right. So, but you don't have GPS when you leave the Earth. You don't have that kind of consolation of the satellites. How do you navigate?  Host: That globe. That globe's no longer important.  Howard Hu: Right, so, you can't use your iPhone and go, hey, I want to go from here to here. So, you've got to have other ways to navigate. So, we're looking at that, but also, you have to navigate together with two spacecraft, and that's called relative navigation, and that technology, we're advancing. In fact, I was -- I got an opportunity to lead an activity within the shuttle. We went out and did a, what do you call it, a flight test, with a technology called lidar.  Host: Lidar?  Howard Hu: Yeah, laser -- it's a laser-based system. A laser-based system basically, using for relative navigation, and it was called STORRM [Sensor Test for Orion Relative Navigation Risk Mitigation], and so, we did that work. We mounted a lidar system on the space shuttle in payload bay, and we did a test with the space station to determine kind of what the capabilities are for lidar technology at that time, and it was the second to last mission of the space shuttle. So, very exciting that we were able to do that. Now we're going to apply that technology into our spacecraft as our relative navigation sensor. So, we'll be doing that. So, we're advancing not only just things that we started doing, what others have started doing, but expanding upon it, the ranges and the environment that we're going to see for these kinds of sensors are going to be really important.  Host: Let me ask you. You talk about relative navigation of these vehicles because GPS is no longer relevant to you, but what is? What do you use as a reference point in a relative navigation system like that for Orion or the other vehicle to know where they are?  Howard Hu: Yeah, you know, two types of things that you use. Traditionally, you have an S-band or RF, radio frequency technology, for very, very far distances, and then, when you get closer in, you know, about two kilometers, you know, something like that --  Host: During a docking --  Howard Hu: During a docking maneuver. Then that's when the lidar takes over. And so, the ranges for where the lidar is very effective, we are expanding that range and that distance. And so, we're counting on lidar technology, you know, to get us the rest of the way in, as we get closer to the other spacecraft. So, that's one of key pieces of technology.  Host: For the two vehicles to then, to bounce the signal off. I don't know if they bounce.  Howard Hu: They do, yep.  Host: That they bounce off one another in order to gauge their distance and the rate at which they're getting closer.  Howard Hu: You got it -- you've got it, yeah.  Host: It's always good to have something to fall back on.  Howard Hu: [Laughter] Yeah, so you have a laser, and it goes to a reflector, and it gives you a return. And so, different types of, you know, I won't get into it here, but certainly, that technology has been there. A lot of uses commercially. Some people have thought about using lidars for, you know, autonomous driving, things like that. I think they're using it today in the vehicles. So, lots of different types of commercial applications for us on Earth, and it's certainly very important for us when we do rendezvous prox ops and docking on orbit with another spacecraft and using that type of technology to tell us not only how close the vehicle is, but, you know, relative attitude. Where is it relative to myself in this spacecraft, in Orion?  Host: Is it right to say that all of that is part of the docking system, the larger system or systems that are required for two vehicles to link up in space?  Howard Hu: Yeah, relative navigation is very important, is one system that is really important. So, it's part of that system that you talked about. So, obviously, a docking mechanism is part of it, and then you also have to be able to fly the vehicle, which normally you can already control whether the stick or the software does the flying, basically pulsing the jets.  Host: Right.  Howard Hu: If you can think of that, that way. All those pieces together have to work in combination to make that \"system\" to be able to perform the overall capability, which is to, you know, connect with another spacecraft.  Host: And Orion still has those aspects of it where a commander of the vehicle is able to manually fly it, and it has mechanical interfaces for it to link up to some other vehicle?  Howard Hu: Yes, yes, so, that's why I said earlier, you know, we are designing both an automated approach, and the crew can have the ability to do a manual, right? So, sometimes the human brain and the human ability to respond to the scenarios are much better than the computer or the software we built. And so, we provide two paths. Normally, you can go automated rendezvous and docking, and then the crew can certainly take over at any point, and either continue the mission or stop it and wait and see what happens, relative to maybe issues they come up with, or they just need to wait and pause to make sure they got it right. So, there's a lot of different kinds of options, and I said earlier, you know, this is why we're building this capability, because you're far away from returning home or you're far away from, potentially, ground support if you don't have the communication capability. And so, you want to make sure the crew has the most options to be successful in the mission.  Host: Tell me about the space for the human crew members. You said earlier that this would accommodate four people, right? How much space is there for them? What accommodations do you have for the human part of this machine?  Howard Hu: Yeah, it's -- you know, I'll be honest with you, it's certainly tight, you know, relative to what we would normally expect. You know, they -- boy, how would I describe that? We have a capsule, 17-18 feet wide, something like that.   Host: Right, right.  Howard Hu: And so, you can think about if you try to fit four people into that arena.  Host: Are they all side-by-side?  Howard Hu: Well, when you're in space, you're floating around. So, you're maneuvering within a, if you think of cylindrical shape, with a blunt body on the bottom.  Host: Right.  Howard Hu: So, they'll have opportunity. But when they're launching, the seats are two and two. So, if you imagine two people above you and two people below you. So, certainly in launch and reentry configuration, they would be sitting, but on orbit, they would be able to go wherever they need to go. Boy, I would say that maybe, you know, in general, you probably have two or three feet, you know, as a cone, if you want to call it, around you, as you maneuver around. Now certainly, certain areas have a little bit more limitations. Other areas have a little bit more maneuvering room, you know?  Host: How do they sleep? How do they eat? What sort of systems do we have for just, you know, for being a human being?  Howard Hu: OK, they can sleep anywhere. So, you know, there's no orientation. If you ever see what the crew does in the space station, they can sleep anywhere. So, they have sleeping bags and accommodations to sleep. You know, they'll have the normal things. Like, they'll have a toilet. I think everybody asks. So, we have an advanced toilet we're building. In fact, we're testing it out on the space station. So, there's going to be a lot of tests and understanding of the capabilities of that. From a food perspective, you know, they have a wide range of food that they normally have would have on space station, and they'll be able to warm it, have warm food, and they'll have, you know, the regular things. Now it won't be as luxurious as some of us would, you know, not a five-star hotel, certainly. Going to space is challenging, but they'll have all the regular accommodations relative to food and water.  Host: In the case of a trip to the Moon, you're not talking about an extremely long trip. It's a matter of a few days, right?  Howard Hu: Right.  Host: So, it's not that hard. If you're going to get to go to space for a few days, you can rough it, so to speak.  Howard Hu: Yeah, yeah, and we try to balance. There's a balance, right. Certainly, we have the technology, and we built in some capabilities, allowed the crew to have some, obviously, meals and such and the ability to have some creature comforts, as we go forward, because we’ve learned a lot from space station, right. When we started with food in the shuttle and space stations, it's different what we've --  Host: Than what we have now.  Howard Hu: Yeah, we've increased. And so, I think it's so really, you know, again leveraging things that we've learned and applying those things that make sense. Like you said, it's a shorter mission. Certainly, going to Mars will be much longer, and we'll have different kinds of accommodations, but certainly, Orion does provide what's needed in the short term for these types of missions right now.  Host: You've mentioned that people always ask about the toilet, and they do. What is advanced about the toilet that you're working on for this that people would want to know about?  Howard Hu: Boy, I haven't experienced it myself, because I haven't used the toilet. So, I couldn't tell you, but what I've heard, or what had been told to me by the astronauts is that it's more accommodating of females.  Host: Oh, OK.  Howard Hu: The design, and that's all I get into it, and that's about as much I know. But that's one of the advances that, I mean, in terms of learning from our previous designs, how we can accommodate the broader variety of people, and certainly, we're going to have a variety of individuals who are going to go to the Moon, right. So, giving them that ability, I think, is really one of the big things that helps, in terms of their quality of the mission, let's say.  Host: Yeah.  Howard Hu: And so, I think that's one of the big things.  Host: It's an important part of the middle part of the mission. You've also touched on aspects of the beginning of the mission, in terms of the launch, which is on the Space Launch System, but Orion comes with the Launch Abort System that you've made reference to. This is another rocket, really, isn't it?  Howard Hu: The Launch Abort System, yeah, you could consider it a rocket, because it's got solid motors. It's actually got three sets of motors on the Launch Abort System, and with the crew module attached, it does look like a mini rocket, and it does behave, because we have to pull the crew from whatever's happening in the situation underneath them, and we have to pull them out quickly. And so, you know, initially the abort thrust is about 400,000 pounds of thrust that we pull the crew in in about one and a half seconds. And so, we pull them away pretty quickly, and we want to ensure that, obviously, whatever's happening, they are able to get away from that. And so, you can imagine whatever scenarios there may be, whatever situation you're in, it's kind of like an ejection seat, right. You want to get away from the situation that was back there fully away, so that there's nothing that can affect --  Host: That's a big, controlled explosion that's going on --  Howard Hu: Could be. Could be.  Host: -- behind them that they need to get away from.  Howard Hu: Yeah, or the rocket is just accelerating, and you don't want to be right in its path, right. So, a lot of different things that could happen, and you want to ensure that you could get away quickly.  Host: At the end of the mission, there also is a pretty elaborate parachute system, in order to bring it back. You talked about the need for the Orion to make its way through the atmosphere, but once it does that, it's got to continue to slow down as it heads to land in the water. I've always thought “land in the water” was kind of a weird phrase but tell me about the rest of this system to bring the mission to an end with the parachutes.  Howard Hu: Yeah, we have three major parachutes that deploy. In fact, we have parachutes that actually slow down the spacecraft first a little bit, and then, it pulls out the main chutes coming out behind it called drogue chutes that pull the main chutes out. And so, the system is three big parachutes, and of course, like you said, we're trying to touch down softly, and we're trying to touch down in a very controlled area, really, right now, off of San Diego, because then the U.S. Navy can go recover the crew and the ship. You can imagine, we would not want the crew sitting in the ship for very long on our spacecraft if you're bobbing in the water.  Host: Riding the wave.  Howard Hu: And they, of course, have felt some effects of being in space. So, we certainly want them extracted as soon as possible. So, accurate landing is very important and that ability to land accurately. You can place recovery forces near that so you can recover them faster. Now certainly, we have the ability to have contingency. If something happened, they need to come down somewhere else. That is also possible, as well. So, lots of different kinds of things that we protect for the landing itself, and of course, like I told you earlier, on the chute deploy, you know, we have like the manual switch for deploying the chutes, right. That's very important. The crew can fire that switch if the automated system doesn't do it.  Host: Doesn't work, right.  Howard Hu: Now, normally, the automated system will be fine. It'll do it. The crew will monitor it. If, for whatever reason, it doesn't trigger, then the crew has a way, and they can deploy the chutes, and they'll be able to land safely.  Host: The program has had a number of, I mean, there are, as you develop these systems, you are doing all kinds of testing to make sure that it's working before you get too far. You make sure, incrementally, as you work along. Tell me about some of the real big testing milestones that you've been through on these various systems to know that we're working in the right direction and that things are working as they're supposed to.  Howard Hu: Yeah, wow, we just finished up two major tests this year. We just recently finished up what we call structural test article. So, we subject an identical vehicle structurally to Orion, both the Launch Abort System, the crew module and the service launch, the whole stack, and we test a lot of combinations or configurations of that structural test article, depending on the flight configuration, right. So, you'll have the stack together. You'll have the crew module by itself, you'll have a crew module, service module together. So, that test, tests out the ability for the structure to withstand a very heavy vibration environment, very heavy shock environment. So, that's the test I talked about --  Host: Like they would undergo at launch?  Howard Hu: Undergo at launch, but above that, to levels above that, because we always tests levels above it, such that protect for if you aren't -- you didn't model something correctly, so that you make sure you have a test program that really wrings out your system, the actual system that you're going to fly, right. So, that is the whole idea of the structural test article. And then, for Artemis I spacecraft, we took that spacecraft to the Plum Brook Station out in Sandusky Ohio. There's a big facility there that does testing, thermal vacuum testing and some EMI/EMC [electromagnetic inference/electromagnetic compatibility] testing.  Host: That's at the Glenn Research Center.  Howard Hu: Glenn Research Center, right, outside of the Glenn Research Center. So, we went there, and we finished that up in March. That was what we considered the environmental test, So, we took the entire spacecraft, not the Launch Abort System but just the crew module/service module, and we put it in a thermal vacuum chamber, and we tested the environment that we would see in space, and we subject it to that kind of level environment, and of course, above that, that we would see, and it passed with flying colors. The spacecraft that we're going to fly.  Host: Not a test article.  Howard Hu: Not a test article like the structural test article that I described earlier, but the actual spacecraft, Artemis I spacecraft. And so, that was a huge success for us. It was almost a four-month test, and it was nonstop, every day, 24/7, we were running it. And of course, we were subjecting it like we would do in flight. So, again, just looking at the flight regime, not only the levels, but the continuous types of testing.  Host: And this is just for vacuum or other aspects of the environment?  Howard Hu: That was just for the vacuum and the temperature.  Host: Oh, OK, yeah.  Howard Hu: Right? The temperature variation, of course, in vacuum, and then you have the hot and cold cycles that the spacecraft would go, because depending on where the sun is relative to where you are, right. There's also that dynamic range of temperature that you see in space that everybody, I think, knows about. So, we're testing that, as well. So that was a very important test for us to show that our spacecraft can operate, and when I say operate, that means we were operating, controlling the temperature inside the cabin. You know, it was like a 65 degrees inside, where we were minus 200 outside, you know. So, showing that the vehicle is operating normally. The software was running. All the computers were up. The thermal control system was working. So, demonstrating, basically, a mission on the ground to the environment that you would see, and that was a very good testament to the quality of the vehicle and our ability to be ready to fly. And so, that was a really good test.  Host: Cool. What other sorts of tests? You've done tests with the Launch Abort System, with the parachutes, and tell me about what some of those other ones are.  Howard Hu: And of course, so, this is this year, and then last year, we had a really big, important test. It was this AA2.  Host: That AA was --  Howard Hu: Ascent Abort, Ascent Abort II, and that test demonstrated our Launch Abort System capabilities. Remember I told you about LAS, right. That's a very important element for crew survival, and of course, a very dynamic environment. I told you 400,000 pounds, one and a half seconds of immediate getting off the stack or the rocket. So, we had a very successful test in Florida on July, I think 2nd, if I remember correctly, and very good for the program to demonstrate that our Launch Abort System is operated exactly as we predicted and was able to successfully pull the crew module off and reorient and bring the crew module back. So, that was a really important demonstration of our Launch Abort System in a full-scale test.  Host: So good examples, we don't need to talk about every single test that you have ever done, but a good example of testing that's underway as you continue to move down the path, I mean, NASA's talking about putting boots back on the Moon by 2024. That's going to take a couple flights to get to there, right? So, let's look forward from where we are right now. What are the next big steps for Orion as you move toward that goal? You've made reference to Artemis I. That's not the one that lands, though, right?  Howard Hu: Right, well, just to be clear --  Host: Or that puts people down, I'm sorry.  Howard Hu: Orion doesn't land.  Host: Orion doesn't land.  Howard Hu: Yes, Pat, yep, yep, good. You caught that. So, Orion, you know, we're a transport vehicle, and we take it to the destination. And of course, the lander will land people on the Moon, but exciting things are happening. We're wrapping up the Artemis I vehicle. When I say wrapping up, we're doing final assembly, and there's a couple of steps that you do at the very end, which is you put solar arrays on, and you pressurize your system, your helium system, that provides pressure to the tanks, the prop, and the oxidizers. So, very important steps, and that's what we call wrapping up the vehicle. So, we should get that done, and then, we will then transport or transfer the Orion vehicles, the crew module, the service module, the Launch Abort System. We hand that over to our ground team, which is the Exploration Ground Systems program, and they are actually going to stack us on top of the Space Launch System. And so, that'll happen next year, and then, we'll be ready to launch. So, all the heavy lifting or heavy work on the Orion program side will be done. We'll have that vehicle buttoned up and ready to go. Our test that we talked about demonstrated that we're ready for flight. We've got a few things to wrap up on the vehicle side itself, and then, we'll accept the vehicle, and then we'll hand it over to our partners in the other program, and then, they'll do the stacking for us.  Host: Before we get too far, or any farther down that road, I don't want to forget other partners that are involved. NASA's building this vehicle in conjunction with the European Space Agency and with other companies, right?  Howard Hu: Yeah, I forgot to mention at the very beginning. You know, the service module, a big part of the service module, is being built by the European Space Agency with their partners, Airbus. And they are the ones that are responsible for providing that element to us, and a very important part. So, the power, the propulsion systems, the tanks that store the oxygen and the water for us, very, very important part of the spacecraft and a great partnership that we've had with the Europeans. And then, now we're going to fly together as one single spacecraft. So, they've done their part. The Europeans have delivered the Artemis I service module.  Host: OK.  Howard Hu: Their contribution. We put it together, and I said earlier, we did the testing as the crew module service module. So, everything's working very well, and then, the final steps are being done. So, very important partnership that I forgot to mention early on and I'm glad you brought it up.  Host: And they based their design on flown vehicle, on their cargo ship that they flew to the International Space Station.  Howard Hu: Right, the ATV, or think I it's called Automated Transfer Vehicle. So, when they joined us back in 2013, you know, that was, when you talk about inspiration or, you know, leveraging their past, you know, they started with that design and that experience base, and that's where our current European service module element evolved, and that allowed us to leverage their experience and knowledge of the ATV design and flight experience and apply it to Orion.  Host: And the Orion vehicle itself is being built in partnership with private companies.  Howard Hu: Yes, certainly, you know, NASA is a leader in terms of building Orion exploration spacecraft, but we count on our prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, who is responsible for integrating all of those pieces that I talked about, the service module, the crew module, the Launch Abort System, putting it all together and getting it ready for us to make sure, as an integrated spacecraft, it's working. And of course, they're the ones, also, for doing the design of the crew module and the Launch Abort System. I told you earlier, the service modules is the European. So, they're responsible for those pieces and they're responsible for integrating this whole spacecraft. So, they're very important partner for us, and they're our prime contractor, and certainly, done a great job of pulling the Artemis I vehicle together.  Host: So, you mentioned a minute ago that Artemis I vehicle, you're getting ready to deliver it to Florida for the people to put it in the stack to get ready to fly that first mission. What other things should people be looking for? What other kind of tests or development activities does Orion still have in front of it before we get to actually fly the vehicle?  Howard Hu: Yeah, for Artemis I, our major test program is done, like I said. Now we will be doing things on the stack itself, you know, with the rest of the spaceship. Well, I'll say it differently, with the launch vehicle, OK. And we'll be doing some preparation for launch. We'll do some checkout systems where we power on the system. So, very nominal kinds of things to get to launch, but nothing significant like we’ve done in the past with the structural test article or with the environmental testing at Plum Brook Station. Nothing at that magnitude for us for Orion. Now, we certainly have tests ahead of us for other things but not for Artemis I.  Host: And I'm assuming that you, at some point, you're going to have to have everybody do an awful lot of practice with the launch vehicle, do simulations, and that sort of thing, because it's something that you haven't flown before.  Howard Hu: Yes, this is true for, you know, previous human spaceflight programs, and they'll be true for Orion.  Host: Sure, and it makes all the sense in the world.  Howard Hu: Yeah, yeah, and we'll have simulations, and in fact, we've already done testing with the ground software. For those who aren't familiar, you know, ground team will take over. They will stack the vehicle, but not only will they stack the vehicle. They have ground software that actually interacts with our spacecraft software. So, that interaction, we've tested also, as well, with the ground team, but we'll also participate, as they power up on the spacecraft. So, they'll have ground systems that actually interacts with our spacecraft systems, and they'll get data, and they'll get command and control capability on some of the systems. And so, we'll be involved in that going forward, preparing for that, not just simulations but actually processing getting the vehicle, basically, powered on. So, we'll be a big part of that. And of course, during launch day, we'll all be there, and we'll be supporting from our various facilities to make sure that everything, all the systems, look right, and the spacecraft is ready to go, and we get the launch team to go. And then, of course, the launch team hands it over to our flight operations team here at Johnson Space Center, and they take over once the vehicle lifts off.  Host: We've referred to Artemis I flying, target to launch in 2021. Give me the thumbnail sketch of what happens in Artemis I, and then Artemis II and Artemis III.  Howard Hu: Yeah, so, Artemis I is our first mission to lunar orbit. It'll be a very exciting mission. You know, it'll vary 26 to 40 days, depending on when we launch and exactly, you know, the type of missions we're going to -- that type of mission we're going to decide to fly. So, that's going to be a very long mission. So, we'll really check out the systems that we've got. Great for us to understand the environment and what our systems do in that environment. So, that's Artemis I. And then, right now, we're working on Artemis II. So, it's not we're waiting for Artemis I to complete and then work on -- you don't have time. So, as we're buttoning up Artemis I, we've already made significant progress on Artemis II. In fact, at KSC is where we put the Orion spacecraft together. We have both -- we're finishing Artemis I. In another bay, we have Artemis II, where we're outfitting all the systems and testing it. So, things are going in parallel, and in fact, next year, not only will we be getting ready to launch Artemis I, we'll be trying to wrap up -- the ESM is going to show up, the European Service Module for Artemis II will show up. We'll be putting that together with the crew module. We'll also start some work, also, Artemis III. So, all these things will be going in parallel, different stages of development and assembly, but all in parallel. It's a really exciting time, because that's what it takes. That's what it takes for us to make sure that we're going to meet the schedules that we need to do to get boots on the Moon and making sure that we're doing things in a flow, and it's a flow, Pat and that flow has been established, and we just walk that flow, and it's an exciting time for us.  Host: I know it's not your job to do it, but when are they going to assign astronauts who are going to fly in Orion?  Howard Hu: Yeah, I don't know the exact time frame. You know, usually, I think the template's maybe two years, something like that.  Host: Two years before the launch.  Howard Hu: Before launch, yeah. So, I can't tell you. Don't quote me on that, Pat, but I think it is somewhere around that time frame where they assign the crews. But the time frame may have changed depending on, you know, what the agency decides to do.  Host: And would it be essentially the same Orion vehicle that flies missions to the Moon that then, in subsequent years, will fly missions to Mars?  Howard Hu: I hope so, because I think, like I said earlier today, you know, one of the things you asked me earlier, you know, what do I tell people? I think, you know, the program and our thought process is to establish a vehicle that allows us to operate for a long time. And there will be evolution. There will be obsolescence.   Host: Undoubtedly.   Howard Hu: There will be things like that, but basic vehicle, I mean, that's what we want to make sure we are building a vehicle that allows us to have long-term exploration capability, right. And that is a testament of time, and my desire in our -- the way we operate is to think about that, as well. So both, not only meeting the missions of today, but also, making sure that we're able to meet missions in the future, and that vehicle is sustainable for that long-term, and there doesn't need to be that many changes, and there shouldn't be, because I think we've thought through it, and we will learn, and we will evolve, and we will update as necessary. Certainly, we won't have it perfect, but in general, I think the spacecraft today that we've designed will be able to last us and carry us forward in the future.  Host: And it sounds like you're pretty ready to go.  Howard Hu: We are ready to go. We're excited. We're, like I said, you know, we're near the end of wrapping things up. It's like a, you know, I had my kitchen done recently. You know, you can see the very end of it, and you're very excited to get back and get your kitchen back. It's the same thing for us, a lot of us who've worked on the program for a long time. You know, it is a very exciting time, because we know, you know, we're ready. You know, like I said, our testing program is complete for Artemis I. We are very close to wrapping up the spacecraft, and then now, the next step is we're looking for our friends over at KSC to put it together, and then we'll be working with them to get ready for the launch and get into space. It'll be very exciting.  Host: Yeah, it will. Thank you. Thanks very much for bringing us up to date.  Howard Hu: You bet. You bet. Thank you for having me.  [ Music]  Host: You are probably aware that the International Space Station has been hosting a brand-new spacecraft, SpaceX's Crew Dragon finished its first flight with astronauts onboard this summer. Boeing is progressing with its ship to fly to the station, and there are other commercial companies building spaceships, too. Don't forget Orion. This is the vehicle that will carry astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit for the first time since the 1970s, a time you may not even remember. Along with supporting the Artemis program efforts to return to the Moon, where we can learn to live sustainably off of our home planet, it will play a role in moving us out into the solar system to Mars and other destinations.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 185, “Returning the First Martians.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, and astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. So, this is the series finale of our “Mars Monthly” series on first Fridays. Last month, we chatted with Natalie Mary about the spacesuits needed to explore the Martian surface. So today, we're wrapping up the series by talking about the end of the journey. At this point, in the human mission, astronauts have used their spacesuits, they collected some rocks, and they packed their bags. Now, they're ready to get back to planet Earth. Launching from the surface of another planet is an element of a Mars mission that will be wholly new, and the piece that will be truly breaking new ground. So, the unique piece here is an ascent vehicle that will need to be prepositioned on Mars ready for liftoff way in advance and launch flawlessly without ground support that we're used to here for Earthly launches. To help dive deep into this area, we're bringing in four, yes, four experts. First is Tara Polsgrove. She has a degree in Aerospace Engineering from Georgia Tech, and a master's degree in systems engineering from the University of Alabama. She currently serves as the lead systems engineer with the Human Landing System Program part of the Artemis Program. But before that she was in a leadership role on the Mars Architecture Team. We also have Dr. Tom Percy who holds a Ph.D. in Aerospace Systems Engineering from the University of Alabama, and a master's degree in Aerospace Engineering from Georgia Tech, and a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Rochester Institute of Technology. Tom currently serves as the integrated performance lead for the Human Landing Systems Program, part of Artemis. But before that, he led ascent vehicle development for the Mars Architecture Team. We also have Dr. Doug Trent returning to the podcast. We met him on Episode 174, “Sticking the Landing on Mars.” He's part of the Mars Architecture Team's entry, descent, landing and ascent EDLA lead. He's filling the roles that Tara and Tom held previously. And to help us wrap this series up, we are bringing back Michelle Rucker, the lead of NASA's Human Mars Architecture Team. And we, of course, met her during Episode 142, “Preparing for Mars,” which helped us to sort of kick off this entire series. So here we go, Returning the First Martians Back to Planet Earth with Tara, Tom, Doug, and Michelle. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Tara, Tom, Doug, and Michelle, what a great list of guests that we have to talk about this super interesting topic, Returning the First Martians. This is a very interesting part of the mission to Mars. You know, if we're talking about a human mission to Mars, I think this is something that I don't think a lot of people have explored, and I know I have a ton of questions about. And so, Michelle, in particular, I know you helped us to put together a list of experts. I am very excited to talk to all of you today. But Michelle, I think it's very, very appropriate that you are joining us today as well. You helped us to kick off the series. And now, you're helping to wrap it all up, the whole mission to Mars. So, thanks for coming on, Michelle. It's great to have you back.  Michelle Rucker: Hey, Gary. I am super excited to be back with three of my favorite rocket scientists today. So first, I'd like to introduce you to Tara Polsgrove. She and I first worked together under the Constellation Program. She was the integrated performance lead. I was the testing verification lead for the Altair Lunar Lander. So, when Constellation wound down, Tara and I took what we learned about landers and ascent vehicles and we moved over to the Mars study group, and she led the entry, descent, and landing team over there. And we were joined by Dr. Tom Percy who became our Mars Ascent Vehicle, or MAV. We call it the MAV team lead. And about two years ago, Tom and Tara were recruited back to the Moon for the Artemis Program, Human Landing System, what we call the HLS Program. And so, to backfill when they jumped over to the Moon, Dr. Doug Trent joined us. And you met Doug on Episode 174, the Mars Lander podcast where he talked about some of the descent work. And today we're going to be talking about the ascent side of the round trip.  Host: Yeah, and it's interesting because it sounds like we're talking about the ascent side of the roundtrip, right, but we're pulling in some folks from the Artemis world here into this discussion. I guess there's a little bit of relation there too.  Michelle Rucker: Yeah. So, Tom and Tara are playing hooky on the Moon, and they're going to come on a little play date from Mars today. Full disclosure, I talked to their boss the other day, and Lisa Watson-Morgan who's the manager for the HLS program, and she likes for them to engage with us because this whole Moon to Mars thing, it's important to make sure both sides understand what the other is doing. And we try to take advantage of as much commonality as we can.  Host: Great. And I know ahead of this, Michelle, you referred to this as or the MAV, Mars Ascent Vehicle, as sort of the crown jewel architecture of ascent, and so Tara Polsgrove, I'm going to pass it over to you to sort of add some context there. But, first, we want to hear a little bit more about you. This is the first time coming on Houston We Have a Podcast. So welcome. Tell us a little about yourself and your work.  Tara Polsgrove: Yeah, thanks, Gary. So as Michelle mentioned, I'm the lead systems engineer for NASA's Human Landing System Program. We're excited to land the first woman and the next man on the surface of the Moon. But I also have had a great experience working with Michelle on Mars missions. And so, there really is a lot of similarities or commonality between the two systems. And so, hopefully, we can talk a little bit more about that today.  Host: Yeah, and so when we're talking about this, you know, the ascent part of a human mission to Mars, diving into that idea of it being sort of the crown jewel of the entire human mission to Mars architecture, can you tell us a little bit about why it's such an important piece of this puzzle?  Tara Polsgrove: The special thing about the MAV is it really drives the rest of the human Mars architecture, or that system of vehicles that are needed to make this mission happen. We really can't break it into pieces and assemble it on Mars. We have to deliver it in one piece. And it's the biggest item that we deliver to Mars. So, it drives the size that the landers will need. For every kilogram of growth that we have in the ascent vehicle, we'll then ripple back and make the landers bigger, which ripple back again to make the Earth to Mars transportation systems bigger. All of that must fit within the Earth launch vehicle capabilities and our payload fairings. So, it really, that vehicle affects all of the other vehicles in the chain back to Earth. Another aspect that makes the Mars Ascent Vehicle unique is that in our current concepts, we'd like to pre-deploy the MAV to Mars so that we know that it's landed safely and it's healthy before we ever commit the crew to a landing. That means it may have to sit for a long time on the surface before it's used. It may be many months to get to Mars, and then months or years on the surface of Mars, waiting for the crew to arrive and complete their mission before liftoff. And then, when the crew are ready for liftoff, we have to have high reliability and high confidence that that vehicle is going to be ready to go when they need it. And lifting off of Mars has never been done before. We have done it six times on the lunar surface with our Apollo missions, but we haven't lifted off from Mars before. So, it's exciting challenge. I look forward to the day that we can do it.  Host: Exciting challenge indeed. It's driving a lot of the designs of other elements of a mission to Mars. And, you know, it's got to sit there, and when you want it to work, it's got to work perfectly. And the thing that it's got to do perfectly is something you've never done before. So that is quite the challenge, Tara. You got to have a great team to kind of bring it all together.  Tara Polsgrove: Absolutely. And I've been very fortunate to work with some amazing people over the last several years. So, I'm confident that we can pull it off.  Host: Yeah. And another one of those people I guess that is working on this idea is Tom Percy. Tom Percy, this is your first time on the podcast as well. Welcome. Tell us a little about yourself and your contribution to the ascent vehicle.  Tom Percy: Sure, yeah. Thanks for having me. This is really exciting. So, I've been working with the Human Landing System Program for about a year-and-a-half now, two years. And I'm currently the integrated performance lead for the program. So, I work pretty closely with Tara on our lunar landers. But before that, I was part of the Mars team looking at Mars architectures. I got to spend a lot of time looking at Mars landers and the Mars Ascent Vehicle. So that was kind of interesting to see how it all kind of relates to each other and how -- what we learn at the Moon can apply to what we're doing for Mars.  Host: And so, what are those high-level kind of comparisons? If we're thinking about -- you know, I think a lot of us are familiar with, for example, the Apollo lander. You know, we saw Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin ride that to the very surface of the Moon in Apollo 11 more than 50 years ago. So, comparing that and then to some of the architecture that we're seeing for using that on a different planet and some of our efforts for the Moon.  Tom Percy: Sure. So, the ascent vehicle in general has a really interesting kind of family tree. So, you mentioned Apollo that was, of course, the first time we used the system like this. The [Lunar Excursion Module] LEM ascent module carried two astronauts to the surface of the Moon. It wasn't particularly large, it was only about three foot by six foot by eight foot, and the astronauts lived and worked out of that for their entire stay on the surface. In Apollo 11, we didn't even spend a full day on the Moon, and Neil and Buzz only did one, two-and-a-half-hour EVA. But by the time we got to Apollo 17, Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt stayed on the Moon for three days and did three seven-hour EVAs. And back in those days, we staged all of our missions from low lunar orbit. So, the command module pilot would stay behind in the command module in a circular orbit about 110 kilometers off the surface of the Moon. And so, it took about four hours to get from the surface back to lunar orbit and redock with the command module. Artemis is going to be a little different than that for a bunch of reasons. One of the biggest ones is that the cabin is going to be bigger. Big thing driving that as the fact that we plan to live in it for a lot longer. And we're going to spend about eight total days and six days on the surface, living and working out of this Artemis ascent cabin. We're going to do more EVAs, up to five. And while we are going to start off the Artemis program with two crew going to the lunar surface, we expect to evolve that to carry four crew. Now, by the time we get to four crew, they'll be living and working out of a more permanent surface hab, but they'll still be using the HLS to get to the surface and get back to orbit. Now, the other big thing that's different about us and Apollo is the parking orbit. We've selected something called a Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit, which is a very elliptical orbit over the poles of the Moon. It really kind of balances our need to access deep space with our need to access the lunar surface, but it's significantly larger than the orbit that we used for Apollo. And so, while it took our Apollo astronauts about four hours to get back to orbit from the lunar surface, it's going to take our Artemis crew about a full day to travel between the surface and orbit. And so, because of that, they're going to have to live in this cabin both in a Zero-g environment and a 1/6 g environment, which is much different than what we had done with Apollo. And the bigger orbit also means that our ascent vehicle is going to do a lot more work than the Apollo LEM had to do. We're going to do twice as many propulsion burns. We’re going to do about 50% more work to get back to orbit. And all of that translates into a bigger vehicle. Now, the nice thing about that is a lot of the characteristics of the Artemis mission profile, like the bigger orbits, the bigger crew, the extra work that we have to do to get back to orbit are all kind of in alignment with what we expect for a Mars Ascent Vehicle. We are looking at large parking orbits around Mars, and the Mars Ascent Vehicle will have to do even more work than the Artemis vehicle will to get back to orbit, but that typically means that that vehicle is going to be staged. And the second stage of the Mars Ascent Vehicle do about the same amount of work as the Artemis ascent vehicle. Mars has twice the gravity of the Moon that's going to drive the amount of work that it has to do. The Mars crew will also be living in their MAV cabin for a decent amount of time in zero gravity, which means it has to function in both a gravity field and the zero-gravity environment. And all of that means that what we do with our lunar ascent system will give us a lot of opportunity to learn and apply those lessons to a MAV.  Host: Wow, that's a lot, Tom. And it's all of that I mean, in just a short amount of time you just got me so excited for lifting off from the lunar surface because it would be a really good idea that the whole mission profile on what it should look like and some of the operations needed to learn how to do it on Mars. And I think one of the things that's going through my head right now, just having that general concept of how Artemis would work and pulling from what we learn there, I wonder, you know, because I'm thinking about -- you call it ascent, you can maybe even call it launch from the Moon. You know, you are ascending from the surface to a lunar orbit when you're talking about Artemis. Now, I wonder, you know, is if you're thinking about Mars, it sounds like a lot of it is going to be pulled from Artemis for a Mars mission. But I wonder, when you're talking about launching, thinking about the grounds systems and the support and the atmosphere, you know, that we have to deal with on Earth, I wonder if some of the considerations for how we do Earthly launches might be mixed into those -- what we learn on Artemis to eventually come up with what ultimately will be used as an ascent profile on Mars. So, what I'm asking essentially, is it a little bit of both? You know, a little bit of Artemis, a little bit of Earth, and then you learn, you put that with the environment of Mars to come up with the right profile.  Tom Percy: Absolutely, absolutely. They definitely are like launch vehicles. And we'll learn -- we'll take what we've learned from launching on Earth and what we've learned launching from the surface of the Moon. All of that goes together to build the MAV, but the environments are different. We kind of catch a break at Mars because the atmosphere is so thin. So, we're not beholden to the same kind of aerodynamics that we have on Earth launch. But certainly, things like staging a vehicle and those sorts of things are things that are common between an Earth launch and a Mars launch for sure.  Host: Very, very interesting, Tom. Now, Doug Trent, you are also joining us, but returning to the podcast, so welcome back. And if you don't mind sharing a little bit about what your contributions to with -- well, I guess, before you were talking about Sticking the Landing on Mars, so what are your contributions to actually returning? You know, lifting off and ascending from the surface of Mars?  Doug Trent: Yeah, thanks. It's great to be back. I had a great time last time, and I'm still looking forward to this whole conversation we're having here. But so, like you said, part of my role is on the entry, descent, landing, and important to this part, ascent lead for the Mars Architecture Team. So obviously, the last episode I was on, I was filling that role of entry, descent, landing, getting to the surface of Mars, and now, I'm here talking about getting the crew back off the surface of Mars and getting back home. And so, just again, really excited to be here and talk about that with you guys.  Host: So, what's your role, Doug? Is yours -- I think you have something to do with sample return? Is that kind of your primary concern for when you're finally going to liftoff from Mars making sure that they're taking some good stuff with them?  Doug Trent: So actually, sample return is another mission that NASA has that we're working on right now. I'm not as involved with it. However, it does have a lot of crossover, things that we can learn basically for human Mars Ascent Vehicle. So, for the sample return mission, basically, for those that might not be familiar with it, it's a series. It's basically a campaign of missions very similar to what we have for the human Mars campaign where it kind of starts with the Mars 2020 Rover, Perseverance that's actually be landing in a few days. Basically, it's delivering some hardware, some tube collectors, and things like this, basically bring and collect some sample that will then eventually, be transported to another vehicle that has an ascent vehicle component to it, which will then deliver those samples to orbit, and then, eventually returning back to Earth. So, it has a lot of similarities that we can learn not just for the MAV, but in terms of the entire Mars campaign for humans in terms of having all of these interworking moving components. So, for instance, when it comes to the Mars Ascent Vehicle for sample return, what we can learn for human MAV, you've got the component of this vehicle that has to be pre-integrated with its basically launch pad, the lander that it gets delivered to Mars on. Prior to, you know, we can't do that or have humans there on Mars to help put this thing together and integrate it with launch vehicles. All got to be done here on Earth, and then delivered to Mars in one package like Tara was saying earlier. So, that obviously is something that Mars sample return is going to have to work with that we as well will be able to hopefully learn from. Another component of the sample return ascent vehicle that we can learn from is they are going to be basically collecting these samples from the surface and then bringing them to the ascent vehicle and putting them on as a payload to then send to orbit. In the human architecture, we have a lot of ground systems and components that will be basically interacting with the MAV and the lander when it does arrive. So, you know, we might need to either hook up power systems that were already delivered on a previous mission to basically provide, you know, power for the MAV while it sits on Mars waiting for the crew arrival. You might also have things like power transfer to basically, fuel the MAV up on the surface, if that's what the architecture calls for, or basically producing propellant on the surface if that's how the architecture looks, you know, there's a lot of different inner workings. And then finally too, the sample return ascent vehicle, once it lifts off from the surface of Mars and goes through its operations to get into orbit, it has to do a rendezvous with an Earth orbit return vehicle that's already in placed in orbit. Again, that's very similar to what we're going to have to do with the crew where the ascent vehicles basically getting from Mars surface into orbit, and then it's delivering the crew to the Earth's return, the Earth in-space transportation vehicle that will ultimately take the crew safely back to Earth. So again, there's a lot of similarities there that we'll have opportunity to learn for from the sample return mission that's coming up.  Host: OK. So, that's more of the robotic mission, I see, for sample return. Definitely good stuff, Doug. Thank you again for joining us. I'm excited. A little bit later, we're going to dive into the details of ascent versus descent. And I know you had a lot to share for Sticking the Landing on Mars whenever we did that podcast. So, I'll be excited to explore that component of this as well. Now, Tom, I want to go back to you. You did a really good job of kind of laying out just a lot of elements, even the operations really, of what's needed for an ascent vehicle making a lot of good comparisons to the Moon, particularly with Apollo, and then, soon with Artemis. I want to kind of take a step back and get a kind of a grander picture from what you described though, Tom, and just talk about the bare necessities, right? So, if you're talking about designing an ascent vehicle, what is the basic thing you have to have on this vehicle for it to be successful?  Tom Percy: Sure. So, you know, the basic function of the ascent vehicle is to fly the crew, and our science samples off the surface of wherever it is we're exploring. We can't bring all of our scientists with us, so bringing samples back is a pretty important part of that. And with Artemis, we're planning on bringing at least 80 kilograms of samples back with us on every flight. But it essentially boils down to the ascent vehicle has to have all of the same functions as a typical crew launch vehicle here on Earth, like you alluded to before. But that includes not only the multistage rocket, but also the crew capsule on top. We have to provide a habitable environment for our crew to live in and work in. But we also have to have the rocket part to be able to get them back into orbit. So, the ascent vehicles going to liftoff the surface of Moon or Mars, just like any Earth launch vehicle. They have to have the propulsion system. They have to have a guidance navigation and control system, and all the basic components of a rocket. But then the crew cabin is where the crew is going to spend all their time. They're going to live and work there. That's going to be their cockpit, their galley, their sleeping quarters, their washroom, their science lab. And if we use the ascent vehicle for habitation on the surface, it may even serve as an airlock to support extravehicular activities or EVAs. And so, this vehicle has to be able to regulate temperatures, protect the crew from radiation and the vacuum of space, provide an atmosphere to breathe, and all the other functions that help keep a crew alive. And it has to work in two different gravity environments, especially for our Artemis mission where the crew is going to spend, you know, about a day on the way down, and a day on the way back up in zero gravity where they can float around just like say, the way the Orion crew capsule was designed. They also have to be able to live and work out of it on the Moon where the gravity is, you know, 1/6 Earth's gravity. But there are things that you can take advantage of the gravity to make certain subsystems function, like circulating air, and it'll be easier to do sleeping because you'll be able to, you know, use a hammock. But other systems kind of have that zero-gravity feature that makes it a little more challenging to design on things like a potty and a crew hygiene system, and those sorts of things. And so, we have to be able to live in both worlds. You can't hang your sleeping bag off the wall like they do on the space station and expect to be able to use it on the surface of the Moon. You can't put switches and storage units high up in a cabin where, when they're on the surface of the Moon, the astronauts are going to be standing on the floor. And so, you have to worry about functionality and layout in a way that makes it compatible with both the Zero g and the low-gravity environment at the same time. So, that makes it a pretty complex system to try to try to figure out even though the functions are pretty straightforward.  Host: Super interesting just thinking about all the different phases of flight. Doug, kind of adding on to that, taking everything that Tom just described, when you're thinking about Mars specifically, right, is it copy-paste from what Tom just described or are there requirements specifically when you have to talk about going to the surface of Mars?  Doug Trent: So, it is nearly copy-paste. The functional requirements are almost identical. So, all the things that Tom just said apply here as well. There are a couple of key differences that the MAV for Mars is going to have to accommodate. One is, like Tara had mentioned at the start of the episode, we've got an atmosphere on Mars that we have to contend with. So, again, it's not very thick. So, it's basically just enough there to cause problems, and we have to consider it, but it's not too much of a burden in terms of the propulsion systems. So that is one key difference that we have on Mars that we're going to have to work with, work around. The other component that we have that is a big difference actually is planetary protection requirements. So basically, we've never been to Mars. So, there's a lot of, you know, debate that goes along in the medical community and science community in general in terms of planetary protection, not -- or making sure that we don't bring any contaminants from Mars back to Earth. And so, because of that, there's a lot of consideration that has to go into design of the MAV that we might not see on some of the lunar counterparts. So, for example, one of the things that we're looking at is the option of using this pressurized transfer tunnel between the pressurized rover and the cruise, living and operating out of on the surface to get into the MAV instead of going out and doing an EVA. Because going out and doing EVA, you know, you get a bunch of Martian dust and potentially other contaminants that could get on your suit. And then if you get in a MAV, now the contamination is in the MAV and you can take it all the way back to Earth as it could, you know, piggy tail it's way all the way back. And so, we want to try and avoid those kinds of potential contamination and hazard. And so, taking into account those things like a pressurized tunnel, to make sure that we, you know, abide by these planetary protection protocols is going to be certainly an additional challenge that the Mars Ascent Vehicle is going to work with. The other thing obviously, is also, we have samples that we want to bring back from the Mars's surface. It's one of the big reasons that we want to go is to bring back some potential scientific samples. And these samples are going to, again, have to abide by similar protocols and protections to make sure we don't get contamination, but also, you know, we're going to have to accommodate those payloads in terms of getting them back up into orbit. How big they are, you know. If they're a long core sample of Martian material. We're going to have to fit that into the trunk per se in some way. Well, if it's going to need to be maintained in an environment that's very similar to Mars so it doesn't degrade over time on its trip back to Earth, we're going to have to provide power and thermal control and things like that to make sure that the sample maintains pristine condition all the way back to Earth. So, these are some additional design challenges that we're going to have to face with the MAV. But in all, it is still very similar to the Artemis program. So that is something that we are looking forward to be able to learn from and build off of.  Host: Yeah, you guys are doing such a good job of painting a picture. I'm like imagining everything you're describing, Doug, in my head. I'm trying to get a good picture of astronauts going from, you know, wherever they are, a rover or a habitat through a transfer tunnel or however, or to an MAV, a Mars Ascent Vehicle. Now, Tara, help me to kind of continue to paint this picture. When you're going over to an MAV, how should I be imagining this in terms of how its positioned? Is there, you know, is there ground infrastructure that has been put there ahead of time like a launch pad? Is it coming, you know, off of legs or whatever? Give me a sort of a sense of what that looks like, the Mars launch pad, I guess we'll call it.  Tara Polsgrove: Yeah, for Mars, really, the lander becomes your launch pad. There's no infrastructure there on Mars like there is here on Earth with, you know, a nice setup with access gantries and umbilical’s, and a team of people helping you, right? You're on your own. In our current concepts, the MAV sits on top of the descent and landing vehicles. So that really is your launch platform. And when we land on Mars, we may not land on level ground. Of course, we'll avoid the steep hillsides. But even being a few degrees off will affect things and the MAV will have to be capable of tolerating things like that. We may also have a configuration where the ascent engine is firing into the descent stage. It may even be embedded in the descent stage somewhat. So, the effects of that engine and the engine flame rushing back up on the vehicle will also have to be considered and taken into account, and we will have to separate from that landing vehicle safely. Another thing that's different, you know, on Earth, we have teams of people that walk the landing site or I'm sorry, walk the launch pad to make sure that there's no debris. They call them FOD team, Foreign Object Debris teams, and they scour it. Make sure there's no little tiny bit of anything that could come back up and damage the vehicle during liftoff. There'll be none of that on Mars. So, we will have kicked up some amount of debris during landing. And then, as we get ready for ascent, and like those ascent engines, they'll be kicking up debris of their own. So, we'll need a robust system that's capable of handling any kind of debris that comes its way and lifting off safely.  Host: A robust system very interesting. Now I'm trying to -- I'm continuing to try to imagine all of the different components here now. I'm trying to piece together just -- I think one of the things is like how the Mars Ascent Vehicle would get there. So you're talking about, it's got to be positioned in such a way that it's, you know, you're taking care of dust, you want to be positioned just right, you know, as able to kind of fix these different angles. So, you know, is there certain requirements that it's got to land like upright or vertical, or you're just sort of still kind of exploring the different options to make sure that whatever, however it gets to the surface, that it's going to be propped up and ready to go. You know, I guess no matter how it lands.  Tara Polsgrove: Yeah. Well, we've got great assets in Mars orbit that are taking pictures and surveying landing sites. So, we'll have good understanding of the landing area. And we'll pick our landing sites so that it's as level as it possibly can be, right? And we'll have advanced systems onboard to make sure that we're able to land accurately in those safe areas. But, like I said, even a few degrees off is something that has to be compensated for. And so, it's just not the kind of the perfect situation that we would have on Earth.  Host: Now, Doug, one of the things I'm thinking about is OK, so the Mars Ascent Vehicle lands on Mars. It has to get ready, right, to eventually take those humans back up through the Martian atmosphere and into a Martian orbit. You know, what are the considerations for fuel? Do you bring all the fuel you need with you? Do you make it on the surface through, you know, in Situ research, your resource utilization? Is it a mix of both? Are there considerations there when you're thinking about the profile?  Doug Trent: And that, Gary is the million-dollar question. So, even in NASA we are continually debating that exact question whether we take propellant with us or we make it when we get there. So right now, basically, we've been challenged to use a design for the first mission, the first human Mars mission that utilizes minimal infrastructure build up on the surface of Mars. So, basically, what that means is, we don't want to have to take a whole bunch of extra components to basically pull off that first mission. So, in Situ Resource Utilization, unfortunately, it does require some upfront work to get going. One is you're going to need a pretty substantial power generation scheme on the surface to be able to provide the power necessary to actually gather that, you know, resources and convert them into propellant for the mass. So that's challenging, and then also the actual technology itself of how do you convert Martian soil or oxygen or Martian atmosphere or whatever into usable propellant. So, those are some things that, you know, we want to try and avoid those upfront investments here for the first mission. And so, we've been challenged with basically bring all the propellant with us. And so that's kind of the option that we're currently working with. Now, all that said, obviously in just a few short days we've got the Mars Perseverance rover, which is going to be landing on Mars and with it, it carries an experiment, the Moxie, the Mars Oxygen in Situ Resource Utilization Experiment, which is basically going to be helping us make those first steps of how do we convert these Martian resources into usable in this case, oxygen, which is a major component of our propellant. So, it is taking that first step in terms of helping to understand how we do that, but they being able to ramp that up and apply a full scale to a large human mission will be challenging to do on the very first mission. And so, basically, our first mission is looking at basically bringing all of our propellant. Now, that does provide some challenges. Obviously, I don't get to just remove everything from the table and make it simple by bringing my propellant. Now if I've decided that I'm not going to make my propellant, but I'm going to bring it, I have to find a way to deliver that propellant to the surface. If I'm not putting it in the ascent vehicle initially, when I land that vehicle, which typically I'm not because that would be exorbitantly heavy to try and put on one lander, which means now I'm going to land it prepositioned somewhere else on another lander. So now I have to figure out a way to transport that fuel across the surface of Mars and then put it into my MAV before my crew arrives, things like that. So, it definitely come with its own set of challenges. And so, you know, it's kind of a give and take that we, again, continually are looking at and studying to try and understand what would be our best option in terms of fueling the MAV in our architecture.  Host: Michelle, when I'm hearing all these fantastic experts describe all the different kind of needs for Mars Ascent Vehicle, comparing it to Artemis, you know, thinking about in Situ Resource Utilization. Thinking about the giant team it takes and a lot of great minds to address some of these -- things that these guys are talking about, Michelle, are just things that I wouldn't have thought about. I wouldn't have thought about as like a concern. So, thinking about what it takes to sort of bring the teams together here to think about all these different components. You know, taking and the challenges that have to be presented just like Doug's describing, well, we may not want to do that, so just make sure you have a good plan for having all the fuel with you. And how are you going to do that? How are you going to solve those problems? So, it takes a big team, Michelle, right?  Michelle Rucker: So, tomorrow's is a system engineers dream. Almost every piece of it, there's not necessarily one right way to do it, there's a lot of different options. And every single one of those options influences other pieces of the architecture. So, Mars is interesting. You can't just look at the lander or just look at the ascent vehicle and make decisions based on just the functional requirements of that one piece of the architecture. Because, of course, for example, Doug just described what you choose to do, whether you're going to make propellant or bring propellant, that influences potentially how big your lander has to be. So, it's really fun. It requires a lot of, as you said, a lot of different discipline experts, thermal propulsion power, and people that can just visualize what happens if I change this one detail over here, understanding how that ripples through the architecture. I think Tara described at the beginning of her discussion, trying to chase those details down knowing what happens if I tweak this one thing, what is the flow down impact somewhere else? So, yeah, it requires a lot of people with both detailed discipline expertise, plus, being able to look across the architecture at the big picture and understand how different things affect the whole thing.  Host: Beautiful. And, Doug, I want to take that opportunity to toss it back to you because as I mentioned earlier, you walked us through an in an earlier podcast the entry, descent and landing phase. Now, you're talking about ascent phase. You're one of these people that is thinking about the different elements here, at least those two. So, give us a good understanding of those two elements in particular, and how they're related, the descent part and then ascent when it comes to a mission to Mars.  Doug Trent: Right. So like Tara said, obviously, the descent system for Mars in this case, is actually going to be our ascent pad, basically, our launch pad for the ascent vehicle. Obviously, there's a very tight coupling between the MAV and the lander there. Obviously, that lander is going to have to provide a whole bunch of services for a MAV to ensure that the vehicle is ready and prepared to perform its role of getting the crew back up into orbit. So that would include, you know, power, a stable place to launch from, propellant, possibly to feed up into the MAV, from, you know, other surface elements and things like that. And so, there's a lot to deal with there. Now also, there's this coupling between the two elements in terms of the task that they're having to perform in terms of so the lander obviously has to land somewhere on the surface of Mars, where we've indicated and the MAV has to basically take off from that same surface or same location back to orbit. Now, unfortunately, the design and of these two elements kind of prefer different landing site locations. So, when we were talking about the landing system, we had mentioned that it would much prefer to land somewhere that is a lower altitude so that you have more time to slow down and perform the soft landing. That's something that we've seen very frequently with robotic missions on MAV. Or I'm sorry, robotic missions on Mars, they much prefer to go to lower altitude locations, because they're using large parachutes and inflatable kind of deceleration or not inflatable deceleration, but inflatable airbag type systems to basically come to a stop on Mars, where the MAV on the other hand, because it's got to climb back up off the surface, got to climb out of a gravity well, the higher that that vehicle can be on a surface on Mars, the better it is because it's just got to fight less gravity to get back up off orbit. So, again, lander wants to be as low as possible. MAV wants to be as high as possible and the two are mated together. So obviously, there's kind of some trades that go along with trying to figure out what is an ideal location. Another component that obviously is important for the MAV too is the latitude. So the latitude, basically, how far north or south I am from the equator, plays a pretty significant role in how much work the MAV has to do to get back up into orbit, where the lander is pretty insensitive in terms of the latitude that it has to land at, because it's using the atmosphere to really take out a lot of its energy to get to a landing site. The MAV, basically, if it's further north or south off the equator, I'm not getting the benefit of basically the rotation of the planet, throwing me into orbit. So, now the MAV has to do some extra work to basically make up that difference. And so, the further north I go, the more work that MAV has to do. But again, coming from the system engineering component of it, like Michelle was talking about, the MAV is not the only component. And obviously, one big thing is determining landing site is what's at that location that I'm interested in doing. So, for instance, if I'm really interested in looking for the potential of ice, and what that brings along with it, typically what we're aware of is the further north you go, the more likely you are to find that ice stored up in the Martian soil and things like that. And so, obviously, again, that's an opposing kind of challenge that we have with the MAV where the MAV wants to stay as close to the equator as possible to try and minimize how much work it has to do to get to orbit. But if we want to go looking for water, we want to push as far north as we can to try and find to basically increase the chance of finding that ice water. And so, again, it's always these trades that we've got to work for from a systems engineering kind of perspective for this Mars architecture.  Host: Now, Tom, I'm going to do to you what I did to Doug earlier in the podcast and talk about copy-paste, right. So, now let's shift over to the Moon for a second. Take all the things that Doug was saying about latitude and elevation, all these different considerations, copy-paste that to the Moon. Do you have to have the same considerations? Because, you know, for the Moon you're talking about -- Doug was talking about interesting areas in the northern parts of Mars, right? So, you got the permanently shadowed regions of the Moon. Does it change whenever you have to change that latitude whenever you're thinking specifically about operations for Artemis on the Moon?  Tom Percy: Sure. So, there are the same kinds of coupled considerations that a changed systems engineering kind of approach applies for our Artemis lander. How we land affects how we're able to come back and those sorts of things. But how it plays out on the Moon is a little different than how it plays out on Mars. So, Doug mentioned that the landers at Mars want to land at low elevations, because they want more atmosphere to use to slow down. We don't have an atmosphere on the Moon. And so, we're not using an atmosphere to slow down, and there isn't a lot of elevation variation on the Moon. So, those kinds of things don't come into play. But the kinds of places that we want to go on the Moon can be similar to what we want to do at Mars. So, we've already kind of picked our general landing area. We're going to the South Pole of the Moon. And that gives us a good general area, but the surface features drive a lot of how we select our landing sites. So, like Tara mentioned before, you kind of want to find level ground to land on. You want to try to avoid big hazards, ridges, craters, steep slopes, or big rocks, things that are going to make it difficult for you to land, and potentially kind of push you off angle and make it more difficult to ascend. But we also want to look for things, like, how to maintain good communication linked to Earth. So, if we're landing at the South Pole of the Moon, the Earth is going to be relatively low on the horizon, and surface features may block our communication. So, we have to think about over time, how is our communications link with Earth going to be affected by the things around us. But we also have to worry about lighting. There's no atmosphere on the Moon so there's no light scattering, and the polar landing sites mean that the sun is going to stay relatively low on the horizon as well. And so, that means that it's going to cast really long shadows, from features like crater rims and rocks and those sorts of things. And that makes it kind of disorienting if people are trying to land the vehicle manually or even for some of our advanced systems that are going to be helping us try to land safely. And we also don't want to be caught in a shadow during the time that our crew was supposed to be there working. They don't really want a EVA in complete darkness, and it gets very cold in complete darkness and so we have to consider lighting. But at the end of the day, we also want to be searching for that good science just like Mars is. And so, we're going to be wanting to try to get close to those permanently shadowed regions on the Moon. That's if there's water there, that's where it's going to be. That's where we're going to find it from a science standpoint, from a long-term habitability standpoint. We don't want to be too far away from those things. And then from a launch and return and orbital standpoint, we do kind of take advantage of this particular parking orbit that we picked at the Moon, this Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit, because it goes over the poles. And because we're landing on the poles, we're not as concerned about latitude and how it drives the amount of work that the ascent system is going to have to do to get us back into orbit because those things stay relatively the same over time. And so, we're able to spend a little more time looking for that just right spot on the Moon that's close to the permanently shadowed regions and safe enough that we can make a good landing and still maintain good communications and good lighting conditions for the work that we have to do there.  Host: Now, Tara, I'm going to toss it over to you for a second because some of this is making me think, you know, we're talking about all these cool places we want to land and then eventually, you know, lift off. But I think one thing we haven't truly explored is talking about doing this on another planet and comparing it to how we do it on Earth. Because when we launched from Earth, we have ground systems, we have a lot of people that are working and preparing for different launches. We have all this support, people running around, doing different jobs, getting us ready. That all goes away when you have to think about launching and developing a launch pad and everything from the Moon and Mars. So, the considerations there when you know that when you're getting ready to perform this mission, that you're not going to have the people there to help you do some of this work.  Tara Polsgrove: So, one of the things that the ground crew is doing when you see a launch from Earth, they're monitoring the vehicle from a dozen different camera angles or more. And they're also watching every sensor measurement that's coming from the vehicle. They've got a hard-line data connection to the launch vehicle almost up to the point of launch. And they're just looking at loads and loads of data, their teams across the country, they're looking at all this information to catch any problems early, to look at the trending just to make sure that everything is in tip top shape and ready for launch. When you're launching from another planet, you don't have quite the same support. You have data from all those sensors, but it's telemetered back to Earth and so, it's likely at a slightly lower bandwidth. So, you pick and choose the sensor measurements that you really care about that are really important to preparing for launch and identifying issues. And then a lot of the rest of it is automated, so that the crew doesn't have quite so many readings to look through. And then on Mars, there would be a significant time lag. It's a 40-minute round trip communication. So, you're not going to be getting the same kind of go/no goes from your ground crew on Mars. Really, the crew is going to have to be able to determine that for themselves with the data that they've got in front of them and with those additional automation.  Host: Now, Tara, I want to stick with you for a second here because we're talking about, you know, we've talked about ascent a couple of times, but what I'd like to do is just capture the operations as if we were performing this mission. As if we were ascending. Tara let's stick with you for the Moon. Take us through step by step. I think Tom did it a little bit earlier, but really, a detailed all the way from ascent on the Moon to splashdown and recovery on Earth. What that mission profile would look like for, I guess, the final parts of an Artemis mission returning to Earth.  Tara Polsgrove: Sure, yeah. At liftoff, either the vehicle ascends to a low lunar orbit, which is around 100 kilometers circular or about 60 miles off the surface of the Moon. And there you wait until you get the just the right alignment to ascend to a higher orbit. So, Orion and our Gateway orbiting platform will be in a higher orbit called NRHO, Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit. We'd like to keep those in that higher orbit, it's very stable. It's easy to sit in those high orbits for long periods of time with minimal Delta V or minimal effort needed to maintain this orbit, so it's perfect for an orbiting platform. So, the ascent vehicle will go up and rendezvous with either Orion or Gateway. The crew will transfer out of the ascent vehicle into Orion to go home. It'll be carrying all of their lunar samples and equipment with them. So, there'll be a period of a day or so where they're just transferring and getting things ready for the trip back to Earth. Then Orion will head home and take the crew to Earth while the ascent vehicle is either refurbished for a future mission or discarded.  Host: Very cool. Now, Doug, take that profile and we'll move it over to Mars. So, what is the mission profile from ascending from the surface of Mars, all the way back home to Earth?  Doug Trent: Yeah, sure. So, again, there's a whole bunch of similarities here that we can learn from the Artemis program for Mars. So starting at the surface, obviously, you got the crew getting ready for launch, getting in specific suits that they're going to ride up to orbit in. They've got to prepare the vehicle, any last level checks that they've got to do before obviously, hitting the go button and doing the powered ascent. So, basically, you'll have powered ascent. Now, obviously, once the vehicle gets into its initial parking orbit, again, similar to the Artemis program, how they're going into an initial lunar parking orbit, we also are going to go into an initial Mars parking orbit. And that just gives us an opportunity to make sure the first leg of our mission went well, all of our systems check out, we can do some potential guidance, navigation check outs and things like that, make sure we've got the right positions and velocities before we move on to the next part of the mission. And so, that would be basically performing the various propulsive activities necessary to get to. In this case, we're going for the in-space transportation vehicle that will ultimately take the crew back to Earth. And again, that's very similar to at least the sustain phase for Artemis program in that, you know, we've got to get the crew from the surface up to this orbiting vehicle that's in this highly elliptical orbit around the planetary body that we're coming from. And so, again, there's a lot that we can learn from Artemis that's doing that kind of operation to get ready for Mars.  Host: Very cool. Now, Michelle, I'm thinking about just a snapshot of what we've talked about so far in this entire “Mars Monthly” series, starting with our discussion with you about kind of preparing for the whole mission start to finish. And now we've taken deep dives into every intricate aspect at least, well, maybe not every but a lot of them, that's for sure. Of what it's going to take to actually send humans to Mars and return them safely to Earth. Thinking about just a snapshot of this whole series, any final thoughts of just thinking about everything we've talked about so far over this multi episode near yearlong endeavor?  Michelle Rucker: Yeah. It's been a year since we started this podcast series right before pandemic world hit us. So, this has been a lot of fun. What I like about the podcast series is that Mars can seem really overwhelming, because there's just so many challenges. So, the podcast let us approach mission design the same way our system engineers do it. We break the whole thing down into bite sized chunks. And then our subject matter experts, and you've gotten to meet quite a few of them over the last year, they get to work solving each of these individual challenges. And then our system engineers knit those solutions together. So, we really appreciate the opportunity to tell our stories. Each story is really important and contributes to the whole end to end mission design. And I'm proud of the podcast series. I get an email from a student who listened to an earlier episode recently, and he said that what he liked about the podcast was we simplify all the individual difficulties. And these are his words, \"in a way where each issue seems complex but solvable, instead of just complex and otherworldly.\" And that is exactly what we do. We try to break these things down into little chunks and then solve them one by one. But because each chunk affects all the others, then we have to knit them together and make sure that the end to end mission flows. So, there's one thing that we hope the listeners have taken away from the podcast series is that although getting humans to Mars and back is a really big job, virtually the entire history of human spaceflight, everything we've done in our robotic programs, everything that we're doing on the International Space Station, and everything that we'll be doing in the Artemis Program has been a step on the path to Mars.  Host: Michelle, this has been truly fascinating really to be a part of this and you're right. I did get to meet a lot of cool people and talk just in depth about things that have just been so revealing and just so fascinating to me. And I thank you so much for helping me to put this together. It's taken a lot of work and like you said, it's been almost a year that we've been we've been doing this and working together. So, this has really been truly a fascinating endeavor and I thank you. And to Tara and to Tom and Doug, thank you so much for coming on, and going into so much detail on this final part of a human mission to Mars returning from the Martian surface back to Earth. So, all four of you, I very much appreciate your time today. Thank you so much.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. Man, what an interesting way to end this series. It was a whole lot of fun talking to so many experts about a human mission to Mars. I know just from getting to talk to all these folks I certainly learned a lot and I really hope you did too.

        description: "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, We Have a Podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 91, The Hero's Behind the Hero's Part 4. I'm Pat Ryan today we're posting the last episode of our series telling the amazing story of the rescue of the audio from NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston during the Apollo 11 mission that landed the first Americans on the moon. The earlier episodes recount the tale of Dr. John Hanson's intent to use that audio for his academic research in communications and speech processing, and how he and his team ran into one hardware issue after another that threatened the whole project, but as Hansen said at the end of Episode 3, his teams determination to succeed was similar to NASA's attitude when it was trying to meet President Kennedy's goal of putting a man on the moon.  John Hansen: We set a goal and we may not have had all the answers at that instant when we set the goal, but people worked collaboratively together to insure that they're going to achieve that, so this was something that we've tried to inspire the students that were all involved with this, with that mindset.  Host: When we left our hero's last time, they had finished digitizing nineteen thousand hours of audio from a Apollo 11 and some other missions of the era, but their job wasn't done, and so neither is our story. Let's jump back in and find out what happens next. Here we go.  [Music]  Who can forget this classic opening line, “Wee, sleekit, cowrin’, tim’rous beastie”? Okay, maybe most people forgot it, but probably most people know this line, that's just from a little bit further down in the Robert Burns poem To a Mouse, \"The best laid schemes o' mice an' men gang aft agley\" Well, John Hansen can attest to the truth of that statement.  [Music]  The University of Texas of Dallas Professor, who is the universities distinguished Chair in Telecommunications Engineering and the founder and Director of the Center for Robust Speech Systems, he had a plan, he and his team of students were going to salvage the audio recorded in NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston during the first a Apollo moon landing and do a comprehensive study of the language used by a large group of people while they were collaborating to solve a problem. The researchers were going to advance speech and language technology by developing the mechanical systems that could better understand the jumble of human speech, as compared to a single voice. Their plan did not include solving a major engineering problem to get the only available piece of hardware that could possibly play the audio off of analog tapes, get that equipment into operating condition so that they can digitize these sounds of history. Completely off plan, they designed and fabricated brand new hardware components. And then they oversaw the playback of more than sixty audio tapes running some, fourteen hours each, just to get the raw material with which to do the science they came here to do in the first place.   [Music]  John Hansen: Yeah, we had nineteen thousand hours probably in the neighborhood of about twelve terabytes of data, and like anything, that's a lot of data and if you say, okay, we've now digitized it, if I threw that over the fence at you and said, here's the data, you'd say, well, that's great, it's too much, don't know what to do with it, don't know how to actually interpret it or use it in anyway, so that's where—and fortunately, the process of actually building the solution and digitizing it, this was an engineering challenge, but it was something that was basically you could think of as, like, a task, something that had to be done. During this entire process we weren't, kind of, just waiting around, waiting for audio to be available, we had students and researchers focused on developing the technologies to be ready when the audio had been digitized, and so those algorithms, the basic strategic is referred to as diarization. Normally we, think, well, if you've got the audio, just feed it through a speech recognition system and you look, for example at smartphones, you could look at Amazon Alexa or Apple Siri and say, well, I've got speech recognition, why can't I take this audio and feed it through Alexa or feed it through, you know, Siri?  Host: Why couldn't you.  John Hansen: And the answer is because NASA speaks in acronyms.   AFD: Science, AFD  Science: Go ahead.  AFD: Hey where are you getting your ESAP pointing data?  Science: I’m getting it from the CM  AFD: No I’m talking about the—does either the LEM or the CSM PSAP have a ESAP performance in it?  John Hansen: And those acronyms are not there simply to, kind of, make things sound more technical, it's because NASA was trying to accomplish, you know, the bulk of the command and control here through audio communication. So if you could say something, you know, in one or two seconds that may have taken three to five seconds to speak, well now you've opened up that channel for someone else to talk, and so acronyms were used to primarily to try and be more efficient. The problem is when you look at any commercial base speech recognition technology out there, none of them, absolutely none of them are set up for the type of NASA vocabulary that's used, that's one and two; virtually all speech technology that's out there is intended for one person giving a voice command or saying something to a machine, in all the communication here, none of this was intended to be used for speech technology, it was people talking with each other to solve a problem, so it's natural, spontaneous speech and the speaking style that we have here is dramatically different than if you're actually speaking to Alexa or Siri, there's lots of coarticulation effects and what that means is, you know, if you looked at printed material, if you saw the phrase, \"cats an dogs each hate the other\" well, if you listen to me carefully, I actually did not say what was actually printed, if it was written there, because I said, \"cats an dogs\" the arrested A N, not A N D so if I were actually saying it the way I should have been, it should have been cats and dogs, but we don't speak that way, and so because of that, the speech recognition technology has to interpret from the audio what would be an appropriate text sequence, and so that requires a dictionary or a Lexicon and it also requires a very effective language model that predicts what word might come over a given word.  Host: Your ability to tell the—to give the computer a hint about the language that's being used?  John Hansen: Exactly, yeah. So when I mention this diarization, well, when you look at any mission for Apollo, they're typically six to eight days long, thirty channels, you also have to think every NASA mission specialist in the Mission Control Center, they're not working the entire hundred and, you know, sixty eight or hundred seventy hours straight, right? So you're going to have typically three or four people that are taking shifts, working an eight hour shift, maybe overlapping by one hour between     Host: At one of those consuls in the flight control room there are, there's a team.  John Hansen: Yes.  Host: In rotation.  John Hansen: So that means that for an eight hour period we typically would have one person responsible for whatever that loop would represent, and so by the digitizing process, now we want to actually go through and do diarization. So that task first requires that we run something called, \"Speech Activity Detection\" we want to identify where there's silence and when there's speech; the reason for that is if there's silence, you really want to turn off the speech recognizer. If no one is talking, you don't want the recognizer listening in because it'll start spitting out words if there's some noise or some other distortion that might appear on that, so now you have spurious words popping up and that's not a good thing. So speech activity detection is done first, after that, you've identified blocks which represent speech, and then you feed only those portions into speech recognition, maybe before you do the speech recognition you actually might do what's called, \"Speaker Clustering\" and the reason for that is when you're looking at a loop, you typically have two people talking to each other, so you really would like to actually identify the turns, if PAO is speaking—oh, let's not—let's say, flight director, so flight director is speaking and he's trying to get information about flight dynamics or something like that.  FDO: Flight, it’s FDO  Flight Director: Go ahead  FDO: In the interest of science it would behoove us at this time to take a checkpoint.  Flight Director: Let me check our associates. EECOM?  EECOM: Stand by one.  Flight Director: How about you GNC whenever we get over this present stumbling block?  EECOM: Okay Flight, we’re go.  Flight Director: FDO?  FDO: We’ll get some cooperation.  John Hansen: So he asks a question and then that person responds, so there's turn taking going on, so we want to identify is it speaker A, speaker B, speaker A, speaker B? And then after that when we run speech recognition we at least have an idea that there's turns taking place here.  Host: So that it can tell the difference—that there are different persons?  John Hansen: Yes, that there are two people that are talking to each other, yes. So in order to build the speech recognizer, you've got to understand that we now need to migrate the technologies that we've worked on for more than twenty five years at our center, to something that would work for NASA speak, if you want to call it that. And so one of the things we needed to do is first to get a Lexicon, a dictionary of all the expresses that NASA would use and then build a language model. To do that, we went and we pulled every document about Apollo that we could find, books, news, releases, everything we could find, we pulled a total of 4.2 billion words in order to build our Lexicon and to build our language model. So the Lexicon, you know, the English language has about six hundred thousand words, okay? If you threw some of NASA's expressions in there you might add a few more than six hundred thousand, I guess, but most vocabulary systems, when you're doing speech recognition are typically a hundred thousand to maybe a hundred and forty, hundred fifty thousand words is typically what you would see. So we built up the dictionary, or Lexicon. What that Lexicon actually is it's got the word that the person would have said and it's has the actual sounds that would make up that word, those sounds are called phonemes.  Host: So that when it hears those sounds     John Hansen: It's going to replace it with the text of the words.  Host: It knows what the word is.  John Hansen: Yes.   Flight Director: Ahh yeah, why don’t you just keep on going through it. I’m going around for T2 stay/no stay, all flight controllers. T2 stay/no stay. RETRO?  RETRO: Stay.  Flight Director: FDO?  FDO: Stay.  Flight Director: Guidance?  Guidance: Stay.  Flight Director: CONTROL?  CONTROL: Stay.  Flight Director: Telcom?  Telcom: Stay.  [ Unintelligible ]  Flight Director: EECOM?  EECOM: Stay.  Flight Director: Surgeon?  Surgeon: Stay.   Flight Director:  Capcom we’re stay for T2.  Capcom: Eagle, Houston you’re stay for T2. Over.  Neil Armstrong: Roger, stay for T2. We thank you.  Capcom: Roger, sir.  [Music]  Host: Lakshmish Kaushik was working as a speech scientist in Montreal when he learned through academic circles about John Hansen's project and was intrigued. He was interested because he knew Hansen's reputation and recognized the research significance of the project and he was struck at the prospect of working with NASA, so he left his job and enrolled at the University Texas at Dallas as a PhD candidate working with Hansen on the a Apollo tapes project. It was his job to build the speech recognition system that could turn the digitized audio of the Apollo Mission Control Center Team into text.  Lakshmish Kaushik: Say, for example, if I say “okay eagle,” so it will try to understand, o-k e-g-le, it will try to separate it into its individual compliments and then try to identify the most basic phonetic composition of the audio. After it finds the most probable phonetic composition of the audio, these units are sent through the language models, which I described earlier, which will try to decode and pose the possible sentences and the words using the phonetic structure out of phonemes that have been decoded by the linguistic models.  Host: At that point, are you, like, playing one conversation at a time to it to put it together? Or do you already get to—are you at a point where you can play at the multiple conversations that were happening at the same time on different tracks and having it sort those out?  Lakshmish Kaushik: No, those things are done in uh, parallelly like, you know we have totally thirty channels in a single—in loop track, and then we have thirty separate audio files, once the system is built by the trans cable system which predicts the speech and then convert it into text, we had an enormous, huge cluster of computers which can convert speech to text parallelly, so we parallelly started this transcription system running across almost around like, running parallelly on fifty computers at the same time.  Host: Fifty?  Lakshmish Kaushik: So we had—  Host: Five zero?  Lakshmish Kaushik: Yes.  Host: Fifty computers?  Lakshmish Kaushik: Yes.  Host: Wow.  Lakshmish Kaushik: It'd be like something called a GP rack, which had almost around ten GPU's which are very computationally, if we share, which can do millions and millions of computation every second and it had more than a hundred EPU processors, which can crunch the data at a blazing speed, so we used this kind of cluster to convert this speech to text. And mind it, we had nineteen thousand hours of data and this conversion is almost real time. So that means that, okay, if I give them seconds of data, it takes to almost around eight to nine seconds to convert it into text. So in order to convert nineteen thousand hours of data, we had to run more than fifty to a hundred parallel threads at the same time to transcribe the nineteen thousand hours of data, this conversion itself took almost around four to five months.  Host: Yup. That's what he said; it took four to five months with fifty computers crunching data to generate transcripts of the Mission Control conversations with timestamps to indicate when things were said. That facilitated the researchers work with this trove of audio, just as it will help you when you go to the website where you can read the transcripts and listen to the audio yourself, I'll give you the web address in a few minutes. It also turns out that the transcripts sped up the ability of the NASA Export Control Office to review the all the material to approve its release to the public.  Karen Walseman: My name's Karen Walseman, I work on the JSC Export Services Team.  Host: Which is also known as Export Control. So what is Export Control and why does anything need to have its export controlled?  Karen Walseman: That's an excellent question and one that the JSC Export Services Team and myself and Headquarters and everybody in Export Control would really like to make known, it's really a twofold thing. The first thing people think about is missiles, you know, you want to control technology so that people can't get the technology that they have  that we have that can then be turned on us and hurt us, missile technology. The other thing is to maintain our excellent superiority in some places where we really have the majority of the knowledge, like in engine design, and so we help when we get with Rocketdyne, Aerojet and these guys and they help us with our engines and provide us with engines, we protect that technology for them and we don't let that stuff get out unless somebody actually has a need to see it and we have a requirement to send it to them. So we're protecting, you know, U.S technology, as well as protecting our safety from, you know, bad people overseas.  Host: I guess that you're trying to protect this information from being released either intentionally or accidentally.  Karen Walseman: Yes; and a lot of people don't realize that you and I sitting here, carrying on this discussion, I could release technology, or data into the public dominion that was not ever intended to be released into the public dominion.  Host: Your conversation--  Karen Walseman: Right.  Host: Might release information.  Karen Walseman: And so if we have this discussion and it contains ITAR or EAR controlled information, and then you put it out on the web, there it goes, it's in the public.  Host: Okay. And those acronyms are for laws that are regulate, the release of such information, right?  Karen Walseman: Those are the two laws, the ITAR is the International Traffic and Arms Regulations, and that's controlled by the Department of State, they're more military based. The EAR is the Export Administration Regulations, and that's controlled by the Department of Commerce and they're more business based, but there is a lot of technology and missile type technology that is in the EAR controlled by Commerce, space station, for example is controlled by the Department of Commerce. The Orion vehicle itself is controlled by the Department of Commerce.  Host: Karen Walseman started working at NASA in 1989, during the Return to Flight Effort after the loss of Space Shuttle Challenger, she's worked in the mission control back rooms on the Robotics Flight Control Team, she's trained space shuttle astronauts, and designed simulators for astronaut training and has worked on the Orion Program, so she brought a wide range of knowledge of work done at the Johnson Space Center when they joined Export Control and her boss thought she was a natural for this assignment.  Karen Walseman: So the Export Services Team was contacted and our Center Export Administrator Ari Blum, said, well, Karen can do that, she knows about older programs; and so I met with everybody and tried to get a handle on what was needed and required and we started exchanging information, and that's how it started.  Host: At this point do you think that you're looking at just reviewing historical information, or are you still concerned about technology? I'll be it, fifty year old he technology.  Karen Walseman: Yeah, it's fifty year old technology, but it's still how to maneuver in space, it's still engines, you know, we're firing engines and we're guidance is a big deal, we're using guidance and navigation and how to control where you're going from point A, to point B in space, and those things are technologies that are controlled by Export Control. The thing I was looking for though was any very deep details of discussions that could be considered technical data and something we would not want to be transmitted out over the waves and into the public.  Host: Can you give me without spilling the technological beans; can you give me an example of what kind of a conversation you were thinking of that might be present?  Karen Walseman: Yeah, the biggest thing you're looking for is when there's a problem because when you have a malfunction of some kind, then the engineers start talking in very deep detail about how the hardware that failed was designed, and what it was intended to do, and then what it ended up doing and that's called anomaly resolution and many times, even when we get licenses to provide support to our international partners, we're still not allowed to them with anomaly resolution and because that will then teach them how to fix their own problems when they have a problem with their hardware in the future, and so you kind of look for those kind of in depth discussions for an anomaly resolution or design discussions on how a piece of hardware was designed, but in verbal conversations it's very hard to get all of that through without having the hardcopy data that they're looking at to go through it.  Host: When you say it's hard in a verbal conversation to get that information through, the through part is throwing me, are you talking about to get any cleared through an Export Control review or to get it conveyed to the person to whom you're speaking?  Karen Walseman: Conveyed to the person to whom you're speaking without having a written document in front of them as well as reference.  Host: That the two of you are looking at and, you know referencing?  Karen Walseman: And then carrying on a discussion about.  Host: I see.  Karen Walseman: That's the better way to put that.  Host: So merely, a conversation between these two people—some two people without, absent the document they are referencing to is less likely to contain anything that you would    that you don't want to be released?  Karen Walseman: That's correct, and sometimes that's not the case, you know, they're really good at explaining things, but the majority of the time they're just talking numbers, and unless you're really good at what you're listening to, it's just a lot of numbers.  Host: Or maybe if you don't— if you already have some detailed knowledge, you would understand what those numbers mean.  Karen Walseman: And there is a lot of detailed knowledge about the Apollo program already out there.  Host: And because it's been out for so long, right?  Karen Walseman: Right; and we didn't have the controls at the end of the a Apollo program on technology that we do today, the details, and so everybody was all excited about the technology that we had back in the early 70s when everything was winding down and they were all excited about building rockets and showing how the engines worked and all those good things, and so there's just a lot of technical data out on the Internet, it's easy to find.  Host: Hansen and some of his students had described to me that they had digitized nineteen thousand hours of conversations, which then is coming to your desk? What kind of plan do you come up with to try to wade through that mountain of material?  Karen Walseman: My plan was simple, I chose what I considered the three biggies, they started with Apollo 11, of course, what an exciting thing to listen to over and over again. I mean, I listened to the entire mission of Apollo 11, I pick out bits and pieces of other missions that, where I knew they were an anomalies and where they were in the—would be in the recordings to listen to those, and then based upon that level of detail, we extrapolated an Export Control decision for the entire set without listening to the entire set.  Host: Okay. You didn't have to listen to all nineteen thousand hours?  Karen Walseman: I think my child would have to had carried on I my legacy for doing that too, I don't think I have nineteen thousand hours in my world [laughter]  Host: Did you—did either Hansen and his team or the technical people who helped digitized that in the Public Affairs Office, did they give you some assistance or some means of helping get through the material?  Karen Walseman: Hansen's team broke it all down into snippets of recordings and then they ran it through a piece of software that would listen to the recording and write down a transcript of it.  John Hansen: In order for NASA Export Control to actually go through and approve the release of this, when we first started talking NASA Export Control, their original approach was, well, we need to listen to this, and we said, well, okay but this is nineteen thousand hours, you can't listen to nineteen thousand hours. So how do we speed this up? So that was a new problem we had—we looked at. So we decided well, let's try to streamline this, we were motivated to try and make it easier for the Export Control Specialist to be able to go through this quickly. So we set up a process where once the transcripts were generated and the audio is there, we automatically populated an XL file and in the XL file we have one row that basically just has the text transcript of what's in that fifteen minute block, and so the person from Export Control could just read what they see in that text block, if they're unsure of what was being said or they have some concern, in the next cell there's a direct link, and they can just click and when they click that link, there's a system called Transcriber, LBC Transcriber tool that pops up, has the wave form, has the text transcript, and all of the links that put the texts directly with the audio, so now they can just click this little highlighted spot that they're looking at in the XL file and just listen to that, you know, one to three second, five second block. So it really sped up the export control process.  In one month NASA Export Control was able to approve one thousand hours of audio, and otherwise they would have had to listen to all of that, so they listened to a fraction of it. In addition to that, we were really appreciative that NASA Export Control also went and started doing a lot of the, I would say, the improvements of the transcripts because when you run speech recognition, it's not going to be flawless, there’s going to be some errors and so the NASA Export Control Specialist actually made some text comments and corrections there, but also had a field there that said, well, this spot is particularly important for this reason, so she inserted some comments there that were really helpful for an archiving purpose.  Host: Were there things you found that you had to cut out that you said no, you can't release this?  Karen Walseman: It mostly had to do with personal information, you know, they call it PII, Personally Identifiable Information because people were handing out phone numbers, not like they're valid anymore.  Host: Sure, they're probably not.  Karen Walseman: And I said, you probably really don't want to do that.  Host: So in all of that, you didn't really find anything substantial or technology releases that, you know, technological information that needed to be protected.  Karen Walseman: Not really, no.  Host: Did you find anything in there that you found really interesting, really fascinating, things you didn't know before?  Karen Walseman: Yeah, that there's a place in Clear Lake back in 1968-69 called the Chicken House and you can get a sandwich, a french fry and a Coke for a buck sixty five.  Host: Wow, we should go there for lunch now, huh?  Karen Walseman: I don't know where the Chicken House is, but every time they were going for lunch or dinner it was, there were only three options and it was the Chicken House and some German restaurant and a burger joint and that was it, that's the only three they ever came up with.   Voice 1:  Go ahead, Network.  Network: Hey, is that the one, the party, the splashdown party down at the Hofbrau Garden back in the back, Thursday?   Voice 1:  Alright I understand they gonna block off NASA 1 at Webster.  Host: How do you think of this job, in comparison to the other kinds of jobs that you did, was this special? More interesting? More important?  Karen Walseman: It was special and because I grew up in Titusville during the Apollo program.  Host: Oh.  Karen Walseman: My dad was a contractor at the Kennedy Space Center at the time. So, to me, it was very near and dear to my heart to hear all of these things and see all of these things because I got to watch these launches from my backyard or sometimes from the bleachers outside of the Launch Control Center, and so to come back as an adult all these years later and listen to these men and a couple of women go through all of this, was fascinating, absolutely fascinating and my brother is an Apollo nut and so this—I would send him little emails going, you're not going to believe it, when it's released I can tell you.   [Laughter]   Voice 2: Powered flight angle 10 decimal 3822; that is a change. Powered flight burn time 444 seconds. Altitude at insertion 60 thousand feet. Velocity at insertion 5535 decimal zero.  Host: Karen Walseman's review of the mountain of material led to Export Control approval for public release of the Apollo 11 Mission Control tapes and transcripts and that meant two things; the first thing is John Hansen and his team could use it in their academic research and I'll get Tatiana Korelsky from the National Science Foundation comment on the quality of that work.   [Music]  Tatiana Korelsky: It was a very interesting development which was never even anticipated before. They decided to use the technology to identify sentiment, to identify negative and positive statements because they were so certain exchanges in those Apollo tapes were so emotional, they were events happening in real time. So people were sometimes upset, sometimes were elated.   Voice 3: [Inaudible] for voice check.  Voice 2: Well good morning.  Voice 3: Ah it’s the man.  Voice 2: It is him.  Voice 3: What have you been up to?  Voice 2: Not much at my age.  Voice 3: Come on. I don’t believe it.  [Laughter]  Tatiana Korelsky: And it was great material to use technology, which is—actually they had to push the technology, because as you maybe understand, to understand emotion you only—you don't only use words, you also use what we call, prosody, it's the intonation contour of speech, it's either high pitch as when people are excited, or it's so—this prosodic analysis was also done, so that was in addition to what they proposed to do and to tell you, quite frankly, it's unbelievable what they accomplished. On a small award, it was a small award five hundred thousand dollars for three years and it's totally amazing to us now what they have achieved on that small small award.  Host: The research that they able to do after they solved the engineering problem of getting the material off the tapes, did it—maybe it's too soon to know, maybe the research isn't over, but did they learn the things they set out to learn?  Tatiana Korelsky: Yes, they did, and not only that, they published many, many papers in the best international conferences, which to us, in itself, proves the quality of their research because if they are—all these papers are usually peer review, very very stringently, you know, and the fact that they were able to publish, at the best conferences, actually, and many papers, just tells us about the quality of the research.  Host: And I to want make sure that we understand what the ultimate goal is here, all of this is leading you to develop these language models and through the use of this raw material that you got from NASA, to create, what?  John Hansen: We wanted the text transcript, but we wanted the transcript that actually had for all the audio, we wanted to have the exact time when the speech was produced, we wanted to at least understand that there were turns they were taking between speakers and we wanted to be able to synchronize that across the multiple channels. So think of this as, kind of, like doing the reverse of an audio recording from a symphony, you have, you know, thirty tracks of different instruments playing, you want to digitize each of those individually, you then you want to kind of understand the score of what each instrument is actually playing, and then you wanted to be able to look across these different tracks to understand how are these different sounds across these different instruments working together. Likewise, for NASA, how are each of these different channels and the people on each of these loops solving a particular problem and how does it affect people in another loop.  Host: And that's what was happening in the example that you used, but you're using that to develop technology that could be used in what way?  John Hansen: Yeah, so by advancing the speech technology, moving speech recognition out of simply just saying, well, I've got one person reading prompted text, let's say for a news broadcast for TV or radio, to someone speaking spontaneously. Moving away from a single person talking, to groups of people talking collaboratively together. The technology that exists for, you know, the first part there, that's been developed over the last, maybe, thirty or forty years. The technology for looking at multiple people talking collaboratively, people have been working on that, but it's a very small portion of the actual research that’s been accomplished and the reason is because there really are no corpora available for the community to use. This will be the standard corpus that the speech and language community uses to look at collaborative multispeaker type engagement for solving problems. The real huge plus here is that these are people solving a real problem, you know, one would argue that the most challenging engineering problem mankind has seen. But also these are natural voices that were being recorded. All the microphones were known, you know, everything was digitized with a particular time code on there. You know, this is the best one could ever hope for, you know, no one would ever think if there's a natural disaster wait, let's actually record everyone who's going speak and let's make sure we synchronize all the audio, it'll never happen. So this really is a very rare, but a unique opportunity that NASA has allowed the speech and language community to have access to, and it really will be a game changer. It will ultimately contribute to better understanding of how people work together in teams. You could imagine the Army or the military would to want know this, you could imagine anyone dealing with natural disasters who would want to understand this and they're going to take the lead and their experience coming directly from how NASA works as a team and that's, to me, a very, very, good reason why NASA represents, kind of a, you know, a primary example of actually how other organizations should work collaboratively together, it's not a pitch for NASA, but it's really what we see from the audio from here.  Host: Now, the second that resulted from Export Control clearing the Apollo 11 audio for use and release, is that Hansen and his team had a go to publish so you and I could listen to it too. It's all online at the website: ExploreApollo.org  John Hansen: We're an academic institution so we're making all the data available.  Host: Where, where, where? If I wanted to go scan it, listen to some of it, where would I go?  John Hansen: So we have a website that you can get access to and it has some of the audio examples there, we had undergraduate students working on this for probably—well, we had several different teams working on this for maybe four years, working on this. One of the spots on the Explore Apollo website, students wanted to—we had like different stories. We said, well, you can't just start playing this, no one wants to listen to the whole thing. So you have to have bite size chucks that would be appropriate. The students starting developing those things, and then we test drove those little stories at the Perot Museum during Engineers Week. Having kids that are, you know, from first grade up to eighth grade kind of listening to it. We got their feedback. We had other, there's another, a group on campus called SEEC, The Science Engineering Education Center, Russell Hulse our Nobel Prize Laureate at UTD oversees that, and so we had that group also review some of the stories and things. So we have small bite size chucks, so to speak, on the explore Apollo type website that we set up. Students wanted to have something that would be like random, so there's a little button that you could say, \"surprise me\" and it would randomly put you into some spot during the mission that you could kind of listen to, which is an interesting thing. I had to remind the students, look, nothing gets NASA engineers more nervous than the word surprise me, so I said, you've got to be careful when you do that, but it was good.   FDO: Network, FDO.  Network: Go ahead FDO.  FDO: Ed?  Network: Yeah.  FDO: [Inaudible] You know that sheet of paper? LLS determination, you know, where you fill in and do all your computation? Right after touchdown.  Network: Yeah you’d like one?  FDO: Yeah would you—no I got one, but I never did get one all filled in ‘cause we had so much trouble right after descent. Would you have one of the math aides copy that and send it to me down the P-tube.  Tatiana Korelsky: The site is very nice, it's very nice, I actually, preparing for this interview, I went and I used the site a little bit. The site has stories about what's happening on this Apollo tape, you can click and you hear the conversation and you see the running transcript, which is automatically recognized, it's a very, very, nice site for the public, and especially, and for younger generation. They I think also that this website, although that Hansen might tell you in more detail, that some variant of it was also installed in the Perot Museum of Science, but that is another thing. For kids, it was just really fascinating because they can browse these tapes and see exactly what was said, and who, you know, who is talking, like commanders and the Control Center, very, very, interesting.   INCO: Capcom, INCO.  Capcom: Go ahead.  INCO: I was just looking on page 3-55 and they got a picture of the spacecraft, the angle to the sun, and the attitude of the spacecraft. And it looks like to me about 90 degrees on that day.   Capcom: That was 15 hours of—  Host: Greg Wiseman, the audio engineer at JSC who helped John Hansen and his team digitize the audio for their project and helped post the audio online.  Greg Wiseman: And so now we have it uploaded in bulk to archive.org making it available for anyone who wants it. And since we've released it, I've been in contact with some documentary filmmakers who are taking this audio and they're synchronizing it with some recently discovered seventy millimeter film that was shot in the Mission Control room during landing, which is really exciting because for the first time that film will have an audio component, they didn't record audio originally with the film, but, of course, NASA was recording the audio loops, so they were able to take our recordings and lip sync it with this film, because a lot of the film was shooting fight controllers, so they've got the film and now they've got their audio; and it's really amazing, it's amazing the work that those folks were able to do resyncing all of this. So all of these things are coming together at the same time. I think it's going to provide a new perspective and insight into Apollo 11 and I think, as we get closer to the anniversary of the moon landing, with the release of all this new material, it's really going to propel this monumental event back into the forefront public consciousness.  John Hansen: We've distributed, I think, a few of these to a couple of different groups. There's one group that's developing a movie for CNN and an IMAX movie using some of this audio, I think, yeah. So one of the interesting challenges from that effort this one company, NASA had a videographer that would walk around with a video camera and actually videotape, you know, Mission Control space, people, working and stuff, but the video recorder was actually just video, it didn't have any audio, so they had these silent films of all these people. They may take, you know, five seconds or ten seconds of video here and then they'd go somewhere else and take five or ten seconds. So all that video is actually available, this one company had access to it, but they have any audio, but they could see someone was talking, you know, on their headset, so they were trying to read the lips, and look to see, okay, we think they said this and then they would try to go back and see—  Host: Search.  John Hansen: Search and find that, but they weren't being too successful, so they reached out to NASA, I think, Greg Wiseman they contacted, and Greg said, well, go find John Hansen up there in Dallas and maybe he can help you out. So we talked with them, and we sent them—we got permission from NASA, but we sent them the full material for Apollo 11 and then Apollo 13, and the way I see is it they're basically playing Frankenstein. What they're doing is they're using video that was recorded from a silent video camera, and they're linking that to audio that we digitized, you know, forty eight years later, and stitching them together, and it's really cool because there's some examples where you're listening to an audio, which is the audio that we pull up, and every once in a while you'll see a video portion of the person actually speaking and then it just goes to audio again, and so what they've done is they've just stitched this video and connected it to the audio. And it's really interesting because it gives you, like, a window into what Mission Control space actually looked like when they were talking. When we, kind of, had some of these news releases, we started getting contacted by, you know, someone saying, yeah, my father worked for NASA or my next door neighbor, he worked for NASA; and so right now one of my students is actually doing something called, \"Finding Waldo\" if you know what Waldo is, you'd find a picture of him. So someone will say, yeah, my uncle or my grandfather or my father worked for NASA so we asked them, well, can you send me a picture of what he looked like at that time and what he looks like now. And what we're going to do is we're going to go back and we're going to actually go back and we're going to actually go across all nineteen thousand hours and try to find examples of when that person spoke and then on our archive, we're going to have their picture and then we're going to have a little, you know, folder with all of the audio clips that that person spoke. So now someone will be able to actually say, hey, my grandfather worked at NASA, here are examples of him talking to Neil Ar—well, he had to be Capcom if he was talking to the Neil Armstrong—but here is, you know, him talking with other specialists at NASA at the time, and so this actually, we hope will show a little bit about the people that worked behind the scenes that really are, kind of, like the unsung heroes that made sure that everything was going to be successful. Very much true in Apollo 11. Apollo 13 was probably NASA's one of the biggest accomplishments they were able to achieve, you know, at least when I looking at Apollo, so we're kind of happy this notion of the heroes behind the heroes, we think it's something that rings true.  Host: They're going to kick us out of here, this has been terrific.  John Hansen: All right let's go. Let me make one more statement.  Host: Yes.  John Hansen: So one of the—you might ask, well, why would we to want try and put so much effort into digitizing and making this technology available? We really wanted to try and emphasize that people at NASA at that time were trying to accomplish an enormous engineering challenge. When we think about NASA and we think about the Apollo program, we tend to gravitate towards the astronauts. The astronauts are to be admired, you know, they risk their lives, they achieved enormous accomplishments for, not just the United States, but for mankind, but when we talk with students one of things that people often forget is for someone to make it to the moon and back safely, you had to have a team to people working collaboratively together to solve some of the most challenging engineering tasks that you could ever imagine, so we kind of used this expression, \"The Heroes Behind the Heroes\" these are the people that sacrificed everything to try and make sure that NASA was going to accomplish this.   [Music]  Host: In 1962, just a couple of dozen miles up the road from where I'm sitting today, President John Kennedy predicted that exploring space would be hard and he set an ambitious goal for the nation.  President John Kennedy: Because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of the our energies and skills because that challenge is one that we're willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend win too.  Host: John Hansen and his students and a group of irregulars gathered for the task, made it possible for you and me to travel in time fifty years into the past to hear the men and women of that America live up to the challenge. You could listen to all unfold for yourself today at: ExploreApollo.org.  [Music]  Thanks for sticking around to see if there was anything more after the music ended, I mean, what more Could there be to say after four full episodes, right? Well, just this, we decided to take a different approach with these few podcasts for a couple of reasons, one is because we felt the story was worth it, but mostly, it's because we can, the podcast format allows us to spend as much or as little time as we choose on topics that interests us and that we think will interest you, and we have the freedom to try out different styles of storytelling to achieve our goal, capturing your attention with the stories of what's going on past, present and future, in American's space program, and we hope you'll keep coming back for more. The Heroes Behind the Heroes episodes of Houston, We Have a Podcast, were produce by Greg Wiseman and me with editing and audio engineering by Greg, with help from Alex Perryman thanks to the guests who shared their parts of this story, Tatiana Korelsky at the National Science Foundation. Larry Vrooman and John French who helped bring SoundScriber back from the dead. Karen Walseman of the Export Control Office at the Johnson Space Center.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 143, “Space Health Technologies,” I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. I hope you tuned in to our recent series on NASA's Human Research Program. We dove into the work being done at NASA to help understand what happens to the human body in areas such as human performance, human health, radiation, medicine and a whole lot more. We gave many examples through this series on different ways that the Human Research Program does research in these areas to get the best science possible. The latest science possible, using the latest technologies. Helping the Human Research Program solve challenges for human space exploration and preparing for deep space travel is the Translational Research Institute for Space Health. In this episode we'll just call it TRISH. TRISH is helping NASA conduct research on some of the latest and greatest technologies and procedures both to find out if it can be integrated in NASA's future missions and also to help these technologies develop for Earth benefits. Here to tell us about this organization, and some of the disruptive technologies and ideas are Dorit Donoviel, Ph.D., and Dr. Kristin Fabre. Dorit is the Director of TRISH. And Kristin is a Senior Innovation Scientist. And both have extensive and impressive backgrounds in science and technology, so here we go. Space Health Technologies and the work being done at TRISH to help NASA test the latest medical technologies and advances with Dorit Donoviel and Kristin Fabre. I hope you enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Dorit and Kristin, thanks so much for coming on the podcast today.  Kristin Fabre: Thank you, my pleasure to be here.  Dorit Donoviel: It's a pleasure.  Host: So, TRISH, I like saying TRISH because it sounds like another person. But it is an organization. Dorit why don't you tell me what TRISH is and what you do?  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah, I know, it sounds like a Texas soccer mom, right? [Laughter] Driving in a minivan. Yeah, it's hard to take us seriously. But that's OK because where are all about having fun with the work that we do. So, it's the Translational Research Institute. That was the original name. But it's so generic and there's so many out there, and it doesn't really tell you what the institute does. So, when I became director I changed the name to Translational Research Institute for Space Health, which is unfortunately -- it was very close to being TRASH, but it's actually TRISH now. [Laughter]   Host: I'm glad you stayed away from TRASH. [Laughter]  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah me too. We are just so happy and -- to be a partner with NASA. We are a standalone research institute that essentially functions through a cooperative agreement with NASA. We work very closely with the Human Research Program and we're entrusted to basically go out there and find what NASA is not already doing, in terms of reducing the risks to human health and performance in deep space. So, we're very Mars forward. We’re very focused on the future, those missions that haven't yet been scoped out. Our job is to connect with the most innovative technologies, companies, researchers all over the world. But really funding things on U.S. soil and bring them forward to NASA to take a look at, to see whether they can integrate them into their current research portfolio.  Host: Yeah, because sometimes you can sort of get caught in the regular routine of research. You're not really looking out for some of those latest and greatest technologies that might fit the needs, which we're looking for all the time.  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah in science people tend to get siloed. They tend to have a favorite hypothesis or a certain way of thinking about things. And they do work that takes decades to come to fruition and sometimes you're blind to what else is going on in the outside world. And so that's precisely why NASA needed an external organization. To go out there and look at things from a new perspective and to help them sort of realize if there's a better way of doing things.  Host: So, how is TRISH integrated? Because I see -- Baylor College of Medicine is sort of intertwined with all of this. What's that relationship like?  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah so, the cooperative agreement was given to Baylor College of Medicine, which is the lead institution, so it's a grant. It's a large grant from NASA through a cooperative agreement. Unlike contract -- contract though we're very free in terms of we have a lot of autonomy. But in addition to Baylor College of Medicine, we pulled in two of the most premier technological institutes in the country, one on the East Coast, MIT and one on the West Coast, Caltech. And so, we have people embedded in those communities that are working with us. And those institutions are also mandated through the relationship with the consortium with Baylor, to go out there and find things for NASA and to help build this program together with us.  Host: OK, so it is -- it's an even broader team than even just you guys? You're working across the nation?  Dorit Donoviel: It's huge. In fact, Kristin and I have been working on building and Rachael our Communication and Education Lead, building a community. That's one of the mandates that NASA wanted is for us to build a community of experts that they can -- NASA dipped its fingers into when it has a need.  Host: OK, so yeah. Kristin tell me about this --  Kristin Fabre: And this is absolutely needed because we ourselves, even though we are constantly seeking disruptive technologies or paradigm shifts in how we do science, we ourselves don't know what's going on out there and so we need our reach to be expanded across the entire country so that we have a good sense for some of that really cool cutting edge science and technology that we don't know about yet, but we're looking for them, and we want them to know that we exist because this is the challenge is being able to actually understand that and to invest in it and to implement it and to bring it to NASA. So, we ourselves are always having to force ourselves to not be comfortable in how we think. And that we're constantly pushing ourselves to think outside the box.  Host: Well tell me about how you think. Tell me a little bit about your background and what you've worked on before and how that kind of translates to what you're doing now.  Kristin Fabre: Sure, so my background -- I stumbled into radiation biology research. At first, I was very interested in cancer research, and so I was at Colorado State University looking at breast cancer research. But there was an emphasis on radiation induced breast cancer. And so, I had to understand about radiation and learn about the biological damages that it does to tissues, so that I can understand how that connects to carcinogenesis. So, when I was ready for my postdoc I actually went to National Cancer Institute at NCI and looked at radiation mitigators. So, things that can protect or to sensitize to radiation. So, can we use radiation as a tool? For example, for cancer, or can we find approaches to protect against radiation? At that point I realized that I wanted to be more involved in communication and problem solving, working the problem from a higher level. I would talk to my selves and unfortunately, they wouldn't talk back. I wanted to have conversations about science. And so, I went into the National Institute -- the National Institute of Health has a great program for trainees and for fellows. And they have these, the Extra-Mural Program, which is essentially how NIH funds all of the research across the country. And so, I became a program manager looking at these micro-physiological systems or organs on chips or tissue chips, whatever you want to call them. But, they're basically these human complex and future models that mimic the micro environment of an organ or a tissue of interest. And because of that effort that we pulled together, at the National Center for Advancing Translational Science or NCATS. I was pulled into pharma, because they wanted to look at these types of technologies on how they can use these tissue chips or micro physiological systems for drug development, trying to either identify new targets or how safe is their drug going to be. And because of all of that background, it really put me in a very unique place for really helping to read and the TRISH mission on how we can use our public private partnerships, how we can look at funding agencies, how we can look at pharmaceutical companies and industry to really drive the mission forward.  Host: What a whirlwind of a path. [Laughter]  Kristin Fabre: I have no idea how I got here honestly. [Laughter]  Host: What I like about your path is you're saying you were -- passionate about cancer research and then you know through this research you get pulled into these different areas. Next thing you know, you're working on these tiny little technologies for drug development. But you started all the way back here with cancer research.  Kristin Fabre: You just allow yourself to go with the wind.  Host: Yeah, I love it.  Dorit Donoviel: And now it's space.  Host: And now it's space. Actually, you know funny enough we actually have had Lucie Low on the podcast to talk about -  Kristin Fabre: I know Lucie very well.  Host: Yeah to talk about tissue chips and what a fascinating technology. So -- and I guess it's through tissue chips that you got involved with space health and the space equitability.  Kristin Fabre: It was the start, I think that's probably what peeked my interest in my background. That and the industry, and government experience, looking at being a part of a funding agency myself, having that background.  Dorit Donoviel: I searched high and low for just the perfect person and here she is. I mean it just like whoa. [Laughter]  Host: With a path like that, how can you not say \"Yes, please come join our team.\" So, you're the Director of TRISH?  Dorit Donoviel: I am the Director, yes.  Host: So, what's your background?  Dorit Donoviel: Well I have a very old background. I'm old -- much older than Kristin. [Laughter] Yeah, I also never thought I'd end up in space. I actually was doing a lot of genetic engineering and mouse embryos and making genetic models for diseases at Lexicon Pharmaceuticals before I came to Baylor. And it was the once in a lifetime opportunity when people say you know, “come work with the space program and combine your love of science and biology and medicine and apply it in a whole new way, off the planet.”  Host: I know.  Dorit Donoviel: It was like what? OK let's try this for a while. And it's just turned out to be the most amazing experience and just blows your mind the kinds of things you see and learn. Every day is something new and delightful to work with people like Kristin and others. It's just a joy.  Host: So, what about -- what is it about the space applicability that sort of surprised you when you just started getting entered into that world?  Dorit Donoviel: This is a great question, probably the most important question you're going to ask today. Because for your audience, people just don't understand it until we explain it. So, number one, I always say that if you can do it in space, you can do it anywhere. In other words, and when I say do it, I mean healthcare. [Laughter]  Host: Healthcare, OK.  Dorit Donoviel: Although, there was recently an article about doing it another way, but the -- so if you're able to keep a human healthy and thriving on the way to Mars, which is a really long trip and bring them back safe and healthy, you can do it anywhere on Earth, which mean seniors in the home, not having to go into managed care facilities. You can do it in Third World nations; you can keep people healthy in remote places that they don't have access to doctors. So that's one, so we have a whole new model for healthcare in thinking about that mission to Mars.  Host: Wow, because there's so much -- there's so much autonomy, you don't have the doctors, you don't have the right facilities, yet it has to be compact. So, all these issues and all these problems you have to address for spaceflight, yes, it would be applicable to remote areas, to that level of autonomy.  Kristin Fabre: As a matter of fact, every project that's in our portfolio we have an impact for space and an impact for here on Earth. And a lot of that is how to reach the patients that are hard to reach or how do you get that autonomy? How can you make this easier for people to grasp so that we all have a chance to have good treatment and good monitoring, good diagnostics with the types of technologies that we support?   Dorit Donoviel: And it's generally about prevention. You never want to get to a point where you have a major medical event. So, it's monitoring and predicting and preventing. And that's the model that should be there for healthcare, because we -- we intervene too late. By then the outcomes are too late for healthcare. So, you know who is interested in working with us? Are the payers. The insurance companies, because they're trying to reduce the cost of healthcare. And they're wanting to move away from hospitals and a lot of you know expensive procedures and experts into the home and to prevent. So, that's who's talking to us and it's great for NASA because we're able to make those connections. We just don't have enough money like you know the budget for the health-related research within NASA is much smaller than the NIH. And so, we need somebody to come up behind us and continue to support a lot of the things that we're investing in.  Host: Yeah, they're interested in the eat healthy now and exercise, so you don't have to deal with it later.  Dorit Donoviel: That's right.  Host: But, for spaceflight.  Dorit Donoviel: The second point I wanted to make about why space is such an important model for us to use here for Earth, you know all the applications. Because people ask me all the time, \"Why should we spend all this money on four people who are going to live you know -- what does that have to do with me?\"  Host: Yeah, we hear that a lot.  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah, well space is an accelerated aging model. And so, everything that we see here on Earth, with probably the exception of diabetes, although we have seen in prolonged zero-gravity people becoming less sensitivity to insulin. You know astronauts generally are healthy people, that's the majority of the population. But when you put them into space, all the aging things that we see like loss of muscle, loss of bone, deconditioning of the heart, change in vision, change in balance, hearing loss, isolation, some of the behavioral things that happen, even as resilient as they are. There are some behavioral issues. You know lack of appropriate nutrition, although we try to give them as much food as we can. But on the way to Mars we may not be able to give them fresh foods. So, all of those things, there's you know so when you combine them, that astronaut is becoming an old person, prematurely. With the radiation as well. So, if we can solve all those problems, we're actually making a difference here for many of the aging related issues here on Earth.  Kristin Fabre: Right, and really to tease those mechanisms apart. Because we know that the aging is similar -- advance aging is similar in space. It's not the same. I mean it's not the exact same as somebody that's just aging here on Earth. But to Dorit's point there's a lot of end points that are very similar. But actually, are reversed when they come back to Earth, which is where it's different than how it is on Earth. So, if we can tease apart some of those mechanisms and understand you know, how is it that a lot of these components happen in space? But then are somehow reversed or reduced when they come back to Earth. Can we maybe understand the story about aging to the population a little bit better? Which is an exciting question in itself.  Host: I'm loving the passion that's coming from both of you when it comes to all these things. But what I find fascinating is your backgrounds are so different, we're talking genetics. We're talking cancer research and then drug development. But now we're talking about aging. Tell me about the team at TRISH and what -- what all the expertise is and how you're getting together to look at some of these problems that you're talking about. Because it sounds like it's cross-disciplinary.  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah, the thing is that you can never cover it all. You become really jack of all trades, master of none, which is actually a really good thing. Because if you start to think that you're a master of something, that you think you know it all, when somebody comes in with a different point of opinion, you know a different opinion you're like oh no, you dismiss it. So, if you allow yourself to sort of say OK, I know just enough to connect the dots. OK and to ask the right people if you know enough to know this is an expert. I'm going to go to them and take in what they have to say. That's when you start to make those real innovations, those real connections because somebody over here is an expert in micro-fluidics. And somebody over here is a material scientist. And somebody over here is a physiologist. And by taking all those little pieces and putting them all in the room and say talk about this problem. They come up with things, but we're the ones that put them together. So, we have such a diverse team. We have somebody at Caltech who is essentially comes from you know, biomedical engineering. We have somebody at MIT that is a brain scientist essentially; he uses technology to image the brain. We have an emergency medicine physician that's working closely with Kristin. We have a former NASA biomedical engineer working with Kristin here in Houston. We have an orthopedic surgeon part time at UCSF. My Deputy James Hury is -- comes from Texas Children's Hospital and he's done innovation for children in healthcare. So, you pull all these different people together and you get a real mix of opinions, which is delightful and really fun.  Kristin Fabre: It's actually a really unique team and I think that we talk about it all the time. We're very fortunate because you know, I've been to a lot of places and I've seen a lot of backgrounds and TRISH is unique in terms of -- as Dorit said we have a lot of different opinions. We have a lot of backgrounds that are different, but we somehow figure out a way to gel and move the mission forward. We're all rock stars. Our communications lead, Rachael is a rock star. We have a genetics person that helps me with solicitation. She's a rock star. We're all really strong in our field, which makes it such a unique place to be is that we can really gel together and move the mission forward. But I also want to speak to not only that, but Dorit said earlier how we're trying to build that space health community. That is crucial for us because as she said we are not experts in everything that we need to be experts in. So, it's really important for us to reach out to people that have never even thought about space research. Have never thought about how their technologies could be useful for NASA or for space health in general. Because we need them to be our subject matter experts. We need them to come to us and say, \"Hey have you thought about this?\" \"Hey, I know that this tool exists, but have you thought about it - using it this way?\" So, in addition to our rock star team, it's that space health community that we really need to continue to grow so that we can really have the subject matter experts and the ideas coming to us all the time.  Dorit Donoviel: So, I want to add something to that, which is really important. So, there's a lot of brilliant people out in the world. They have a lot of great ideas. The problem for NASA is that they're not focused or they're not reasonable for what NASA needs. In other words, yeah you can suggest doing MRI's in space, but you know, you have to educate people you can't take an MRI machine. Or,” hey let's do an x-ray;’’ well we really don't want to introduce more radiation in space, we already have enough radiation. Or people come up with fantastic ideas. But what's reasonable and what is the -- the other thing is NASA everything's a trade, right? So, if I'm going to choose to take this medical device, that means I can't take this food. Or I have to take less water. Or, I have to reduce the habitable volume if I have to include this particular medical device. So, NASA is always thinking about what do I absolutely have to have, not what's nice to have. So, there's lots of wonderful things that people come up with and tell us about and they want to take it to space, or they want us to take it to space. And they're lovely, wonderful inventions. But we always have to be thinking about NASA. So, our other job, other than reaching out and bringing those technologies in, is educating. We have to explain to people in layman's terms or, “hey, I know you're in love with your technology. You're a researcher and you love your research and we get it. It's important. But it doesn't fit with NASA's need or here's why we need you to work on it differently.” So, it's part of our job to sort of educate the public, so it's a two-way communication, so we act as the go between. And I sort of call ourselves our mom and pop NASA. Because we're much more approachable. Like it's very hard to talk to somebody at NASA to get them to speak to you.  Host: We speak in acronyms. [Laughter]  Dorit Donoviel: You do, it's a whole new thing. But we're much more approachable. Like Kristin's -- we have a Salesforce is something we use, it's used in business as a way to manage leads. And Rachael, our communication lead put together a community force, we call it the orbit. And people in there can ask questions where you can sort of have like a chat and get access to experts within NASA and us and so.  Host: This is what you -- this is when you said community, this is what you mean. It's not -- you don't want to be a resource. You don't want to be a hub where everyone is coming to you. You want to make sure you build that community and establish that two-way communication. Because -  Dorit Donoviel: And educate them --  Host: And educate --  Kristin Fabre: And for them to have conversations with the community.  Host: With each other.  Kristin Fabre: So, we don't need to always be a part of that conversation. We -- there are examples where there are folks that have technologies that are going on to station soon. And they want to reach out to the community and say, “hey what kind of sales or what kind of questions do you have? I've got this technology, partner with me.” So, I also want to see not just a two-way communication between TRISH and the rest of the community. But I want to see the community talking amongst themselves.  Dorit Donoviel: It's already happening. I get notes all the time of people talking, like what are they talking about? I have no idea what they're talking about, but they went off.  Kristin Fabre: Absolutely and we've seen it time and time again, is allowing these people to be educated and think in a way that they never thought before. And it allows them to come up with a better, stronger idea for space health research. And that also makes them even a stronger candidate for a NASA grant in the future. And so, again, one of our deliverables is bringing people that are new to NASA in and have successful grants that can go to NASA as well.  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah so if people want to join in, anybody can. It's open to everybody it’s called TRISH.force.com. And force because we're the force. [Laughter] [Multiple Speakers] Host:  Well tell me more about this community? Are we talking universities, are we talking industry?  Dorit Donoviel: We don't exclude anybody. I mean obviously we moderate it and make sure there's no crazy people with tin hats, which we do get a few of those. But, I want to make sure that I do speak to something else that we deliver to the community, to NASA too, is we run a lot of virtual workshops. We did one through Caltech organized for us on [Artificial Intelligence] AI and healthcare. We did one with MIT, media lab on how to enrich indoor environments to improve behavior health. And we brought in a lot of different speakers and companies to talk about. Even furniture companies are thinking about these things. We had one of the sponsors of the work shop was a furniture company. And they're thinking about how to change indoor environments to improve your performance at work. So, you know --  Host: --Ergonomics.  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah you never know. It's not just ergonomics. It's like your mood, like the lighting, the sun. When you talk to some of the astronauts they'll say, \"You know it's a whole year with no change in seasons.\" It's like the same air, the same smell, the same temperature, the same humidity --  Kristin Fabre: --Monochrome.  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah and it's very sterile. So, OK maybe they could put up with it for a year on the ISS, but on the way to Mars, that's a whole different thing. So, we have that workshop. Everything is archived. We do a lot of -- we call it the Red Risk Schools. So, NASA prioritized Human Research Program prioritized the risks by color. So red, stop you know. Yellow, medium and then green we're probably OK to go. So, we call it the Red Risks, which are highest priority, “hey we need to solve these problems before we go to Mars.” So, we put on the Red Risk School. And so, you know for a whole week and there's one coming up let's see Rachael, when is it coming up? In February we'll do the next one, but we also archived the last two years, we've also done it -- we have experts speaking on it from NASA or the community about the top risks, what are the problems, what are the needs, how people's research can fit in. So that's all archived through our website and also the TRISH force, you can find links to it. And then we did recently a work shop with a local subject matter expert as a young entrepreneur started this company on [Virtual Reality] VR. Brought in experts from all over the world, I mean he had people because this was virtual, so you had people from you know the UK, Australia, Spain, you know obviously the U.S. Just from everywhere talking about how to use VR and what are the latest technologies, VR for training. VR for behavior health. VR to improve your exercise. Just how to use VR and then we had a NASA expert explaining OK what are the limitations in the space environment, so it was sort of like a comprehensive thing. So, we're trying to provide a lot of that content, but I didn't even get to the main thing that we do. That's like the extra stuff. The main thing we do, most of our money is to fund research. So, we give a lot of research grants and they're through solicitations, but they're also like if you have a great idea come on in and tell Kristin about it. We have you know a dashboard where we can look at things, through -- you can find it through our website or you can find it through TRISHforce.com. And you know Kristin -- so we do solicitation. So, there -- either to companies or universities and we give a lot of money away. We give a lot of money away, millions of dollars to various people. And we have a training program. We have post-doctoral fellows, actually the fellowship I think opportunity the current one closes today. We -- I think I'll save it for the next one for what we have current opportunities open. But Kristin why don't you talk a little bit about the radiation solicitation.  Kristin Fabre: Sure, so we have just opened a radiation solicitation. So again, my background being at NCATS is that the tissue chips. And you -- so you're familiar with that with your discussion with Lucie Low so it's on a previous podcast. And what we want to do, so tissue chips or micro physiological systems are not -- they're not very new anymore. They've been around for a while, lots of publications, pharmaceutical companies are starting to use them. Other agencies are starting to invest in them. But, we want to see how we can use these technologies for again looking at human tissue for the first time, physiological system, human tissue to look at space relevant radiation. So that's -- that's goal number one, is can we use these as a human analog? And then can we look at multiple tissues of interest or organs of interest to see what would happen maybe with or connected, single or connected; so that's goal one. And the other goal is countermeasures, and so there's a lot of effort and there's always been a lot of effort on radiation countermeasures, a lot of people have their favorite pharmaceutical or nutraceutical. And so, we're allowing that to be tested as a proof of concept in the tissue chip as well. But, where I really want to -- I'm going to say the word TRISH out, so where I wanted to go bold and beyond is that come up with another outside of the box countermeasure. And a lot of people, so right now are -- our current portfolio has some work on looking at gene editing. Looking at tardigrades, so can we embrace our inner tardigrade or water bear system and the genes that make them radiation resistant? You know can we understand -- can we understand that a little bit better? Is there any homologs that are within our DNA that we can transiently induce for a short period of time, and I know that can be controversial, but it's kind of where we are sometimes, those provocative questions.  Host: Yes, this is the innovative ground-breaking technology that you're talking about.  Kristin Fabre: Right, exactly.  Host: This is what you want to explore.  [Multiple Speakers]  Kristin Fabre: Let's get a little queasy and we're probably spot on. So, what about different types of materials? What about bio-electronics? What about a whole different approach? What about slowing down metabolism and seeing if we can allow the cells time to repair their DNA? What about saving the stem cell campaign? Can we have a batch of stem cells for astronauts that we can re-introduce them to and to the tissue later to see if we can keep like a fresh healthy batch of cells? These are just examples. I want people to come up with other ideas too, but that's where we really want to push the boundaries with these types of technologies. And that's ultimately the goal of this first solicitation on radiation and tissue chips.  Dorit Donoviel: I want to talk about -- just because this -- audience we have currently opened solicitations or programs. So, the other one, we call it the swap, which is our way of helping NASA again take its scientists and put them out in the community, so they can learn something new. And then take scientists who are out there and put them into NASA centers, so they can learn about NASA's needs and requirements. And you know the constraints of spaceflight. So, it's sort of an exchange of scientists, so it's formally known as the Faculty Exchange or the Space Health Swap. So that just went live today. And that's open to civil servants going out and open for scientists who want to spent their summer at a NASA center. And we're going to make that happen for them. So, space camp for adults.  Host: Wow, yeah you said the main thing you do is you do research grants. But we're talking about a whole bunch of other stuff too. It sounds like the education part is really important because what you're trying to accomplish is when you get these ideas, you want them to be informed. So, you're not missing out on well technically NASA needs this to be smaller. Well you really need to think about the weight of this thing. Or you need to think about the radiation aspect, because they have a ton of radiation. There's a ton of education.  Dorit Donoviel: It's particularly interesting with industry. So, let's talk about industry. So, we have an upcoming solicitation in the spring specifically for companies, because it's really not fair to companies to put them in the same mix with academics who write proposals for a living. I mean they write grant proposals for a living. And they're very, very good at writing proposals. Companies have a different approach. They generally have a slide deck that they share with an investor, they have a different time line, they're very, very good at delivering products fairly efficiently and you know especially the scrappy ones, the startups. They can do it for very little money. So that's a great bargain for NASA. We've come across quite a lot of small companies that have delivered things for very little money. And so that's wonderful, but the problem is that they need to be educated on how -- what they're already doing for their so-called Earth market, we laugh about that. The space market they're like “oh who is going to buy this?” Like NASA and one other person, maybe Elon Musk. Maybe they'll buy four; you know how is that important for my business model? Well, all the things that they're doing for Earth, we're going to make it better for Earth because it's going to be miniaturized. It's going to be cheaper. It's going to be used by non-expert user and so the high dollar in really complicated equipment, we're not really interested in, but all the things that are -- the small companies are developing for in the home care, elderly monitoring, the kiosks that are going to be going up in Walgreens that will do all of your health surveillance. The smart mirrors in the bathrooms, all of those technologies and the AI that goes behind that is very much applicable for what we’re thinking about for space the autonomous healthcare model. So, it's an education of companies to realize that what they're going to do for us is actually down the path of their own Earth market. We are not going to distract them. That's what investors are worried about that they're going to get distracted by this NASA thing over here. But no what the NASA thing is exactly in line with the market that they're going after, which is reducing cost to healthcare. And what we're going to focus on in this upcoming solicitation is behavior health. And you know this is -- people don't like to talk about it. Because astronauts are incredibly resilient human beings. I mean they're screened for this, right? But nobody has ever been in a tin can for three years, far away from Earth. Like we've done isolation studies, but nowhere near the length and the kind of danger they're going to be under. And so small of volume, and you're going to be with three people that your boss picked out for you. And you're going to smell their smell for three years. So, the behavior aspect is actually something that NASA is worried about. So, what are companies doing on monitoring behavioral health and improving behavior health and providing people with tools that they can apply themselves? We all have times of depression. And so, what can we do to mines what's out there, to help the astronauts on that -- on that long duration mission?  Host: So, what you're looking at -- you're looking at what it takes to have the resilience of an astronaut to live in a tin can for three years far away from home with the same people. Take those same applicability's and maybe check on like -- try to come up with ways for -- to improve behavior health or be resilient here on Earth. Is that sort of it? Maybe I'm on the wrong track?  Dorit Donoviel: It's not about what it takes to be resilient. We know these people are resilient. These astronauts are resilient. We know that. No. Even resilient people need cues that something is off. OK? And OK say for example I'll just give you -- I'll just paint the picture, it's always better. So, say you know an astronaut is just starting to feel down, maybe the exercise equipment broke down. Hasn't been able to exercise, is not feeling really well. Maybe the -- maybe one of the vitamins went down and now they don't have vitamin D anymore. Something like that. There's something going on right? And so that astronaut starts to maybe sleep a little more, maybe spend less time with other crew mates, maybe smile less, maybe use language that's more negative. So, there are ways to pick up on those things and the AI system would maybe inform the commando or the medical -- the medical officer of the mission. \"Hey, this crew member is a little off, check in on him.\" So maybe -- so it alerts and then maybe they make sure they get him a vitamin D. Maybe they make sure that they figure out another way to exercise. So, it starts to alert you before it actually becomes a problem, or it can alert the person themselves. “Hey, you're a little off today. What's going on? Maybe write in your journal. Maybe share this, maybe talk to the AI, maybe talk to the medical officer. Maybe try to call home and talk to your flight surgeon about what might be going on with you.” So that's what I'm talking about is to put the tools in your hand to recognize, but also have a strategy. There's no point to recognizing if you can't do anything about it. So, it's all about the countermeasures as well.  Host: The countermeasures as well, but there's that technology for identifying monitoring and realizing--  Kristin Fabre: And that's one aspect, but I'm also very interested in the physiological aspect because we do know that diet and nutrition and the microbiome can play a role in this. So, there's a lot of new research on this gut brain axis. And how what we eat can impact our mood or what's happening with our microbiome that could induce inflammation that could also impact our mood. And we don't know what radiation can do to our behavioral health or our cognitive function. So, there's also this physiological underlying that I think is also really interesting for TRISH to pursue and to invest in that address’s cognitive performance and behavioral health.  Host: So, along the lines of what we're talking about, we're investigating different examples right now. We're investigating all these different ways that you guys -- tell me about what's going on -- what else is going on right now that you're doing at TRISH?  Kristin Fabre: So, well there's -- we've recently funded something in the category of what we call “just in time medicine.” So rather than having an entire pharmaceutical kit that you have to take with you, can you make drugs on the fly? Can we take with us let's just call them ingredients for formulations for the pharmaceutical ingredient to say OK, you know we don't know what we can face or what we're going to be up against, but let's try to take a kit with us and build these drugs as needed. So, we're actually funding a couple of projects where we've selected a couple projects that can tackle this from a small molecule component. So, having the right formulations in pieces where you can build these small molecules like basically kind of in a kit where you can say I need this type of small molecule. I need this type of --  Dorit Donoviel: Can I just jump in and explain to the listeners; small molecule is the typical drugs that you take by mouth. Large molecules and pharma, because Kristin and I both came from pharma. Large molecules are the antibodies you have to inject or proteins like [Erythropoietin] EPO. So small molecules are the things that you generally take by mouth.  Host: Oral medication.  Kristin Fabre: Yeah most of our drugs are small molecules.  Host: OK.  Kristin Fabre: So, can we build those on the fly as needed? And then also going to those larger, those types of drugs that are the biologics to those larger proteins, those larger molecules, can we also build those on the fly as well? And we've actually selected a project that can or that is suggesting that they can make these larger therapeutics, these larger drugs, these biologics in lettuce. So, can you eat your drugs? So that's something that we're trying to explore as well. We're also thinking about stability of our drugs. So, we have a group that is looking at using silk protein to basically have a pouch or a case where you can put your drugs in that will protect against some of the hazards like radiation, for example. So, we're very keen on how we can keep that pharmaceutical kit fresh and relevant and safe and effective on our way to Mars and back.  Host: That's the space application, right? Is like if you buy an over the counter medicine that has an expiration date, you know you can't have it sitting on the shelf for three years. So, this would be a way to make sure that you can have the medicine you need for the entire duration –  Kristin Fabre: Correct, correct.  Dorit Donoviel: It's a Red Risk. It's what we call the Red Risk.  Host: Red Risk.  Dorit Donoviel: It's called medication.  Host: OK.  Dorit Donoviel: And like you just said most pharmaceutical companies they don't need this to last that long. They want you to dump it out, so you can buy more, right? In fact, I just put something in the garbage this morning. It expired after a year. So, on the way to Mars as Kristin says, we need to protect those drugs or make them as needed.  Host: I see another benefit too, because that means you may, correct me if I'm wrong, you may have to take less with you. Because now you just have ingredients and you put them together as you need them. So, you don't need this -- a bottle of this, a bottle of that. Now you're limiting mass as well.  Kristin Fabre: And it's a multi-purpose. So, say we went with the plant route. So, we're going to be growing lettuce anyway, well the hope is that we'll have some fresh fruits to be growing. So, can we use plants for multiple purposes and so for nutrition, for CO2, scrubbing for -- can we use them to make our drugs and ingest that way? So, trying to come up with clever ways on how we can use the tools that are on the craft for the needs, for the crew.  Host: Like -- I'm thinking about other applications too. I'm thinking about Earth applications, so what would be nice on Earth to have the build your own pharma kit?  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah so actually this whole idea started at [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency] DARPA. So, -- Geoffrey Ling who was a former DARPA manager, whose military guy. He was basically deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq. And the biggest problem they had is they didn't have the drugs on-site. They like simple drugs that you would just take for granted here on Earth. In battle, you know where you're -- the farthest corridor of the world it was really hard to get drugs. It would take two or three days to get an antibiotic in. And the person died. So, he was the one that actually initiated what he calls 3D printing of pharmaceuticals and he started a company after he left DARPA and it's actually I think he's partnered up with some folks at either Hopkins or MIT and I apologize for not knowing. But that whole concept of 3D printing is critical because here's the other thing is hospitals right now, they run out of stock. Certain drugs they run out of. And if the manufacturer of generics for example in India or in China, Israel or Canada is behind or there's a shortage, you've got people who are depending on these drugs. You're not able to make them. So, think about it, if you're a hospital administrator and you need to crank out a whole bunch of drugs you can make them right there. So, there's a lot of Earth applications for these things as well.  Host: Very important timely earthy applications is incredible.  Kristin Fabre: And those hard to reach places so some of the places that don't have access to hospitals or healthcare that you can maybe get to the -- get to these communities earlier and quicker to give them their medications.  Dorit Donoviel: We want people to understand that we realize, we're not going to be growing a whole lot of plants on that tiny craft to Mars. It's the concept and maybe we have a Mars colony and maybe there, we can grow not potatoes, but lettuce. We also funded a project that the tomatoes, space tomatoes that are highly miniaturized plant, big fruit but they scrub CO2. So, talk about helping with the green gas. You know becoming a green technology.  Host: Nutrition and for the environment. For the contained environment.  Dorit Donoviel: It's about really you know learning what we can learn about using functional foods, if you will.  Host: Yeah, wow that was just one example that I -- after I asked for examples? [Laughter]  Kristin Fabre: We have a variety. We try to keep our portfolio pretty diverse in terms of how we address the risks that NASA has. We think about cognitive function. We think about radiation. We think about cardio vasculature function and just health. We think about the visual problems that astronauts have. We think about immune. There's -- we have quite a diverse portfolio and we think we need it.  Dorit Donoviel: It's quite humbling because we don't know nearly enough as we should. We know just enough to be dangerous about all these things. [Laughter] Yeah, a couple other examples like Kristin was just mentioning, the ophthalmic issues. So ophthalmic, vision care and making sure that the optic nerve is healthy, and the eyeballs are healthy. And we see this in a lot of the astronauts now and it's not new problem. But we really -- nobody has ever lost vision as a result. We just don't know over three years what will happen. And so again it's that length of time when they go up for a year, in the ISS and they're in zero-gravity. They have change in vision, they have swelling of the optic nerve and they come back to Earth and things get back to normal. We just don't know about three years. Up to three years on that Mars mission, we just don't know. Or, maybe in accommodation with the space radiation, which they're not getting a whole -- I mean they're getting some radiation on the ISS right now, but not nearly what they're going to get on deep space.  Host: And not the right kinds too. [Galactic Cosmic Radiation] GCR’s, all these other things –  Dorit Donoviel: That’s right.  Kristin Fabre: Correct, exactly.  Dorit Donoviel: In combination with that they may have a problem. So, what we've invested in is from ophthalmic technology is do it yourself ophthalmology. OK. So, you stick your eyeball into the viewfinder and that thing will adjust the -- prescription for you so that you can see what you need to see. And it will take a retinal scan of you, basically right now. You need to have another person helping you or an expert to help you align your pupil and everything.  Kristin Fabre: You have to dilate your pupil.  Dorit Donoviel: You have to dilate to get the back of the retina and so that -- do it yourself eye exam that will give you all the information you need. That does not exist today. So, guess where the company is going to take it? CVS and Walgreen. So just like now you have those machines you stick your arm into it and get a blood pressure, you can go in there and do the scan on your eye. Why is this important? There is so many people at risk for losing vision because of diabetic retinopathy. A lot of diabetics -- it's a silent vision killer. You have no idea you have diabetic retinopathy. If your doctor is good they're going to be sending you to an ophthalmologist every year to make sure you're OK. But there are a lot of people with unmanaged or even undiagnosed diabetes. So, what if you go into your Walgreens to pick up the prescription for something an you're in there buying you know a box of diapers, and you go up and you stick your eyeball on this thing, put in ten bucks, or something like that and it says hey your optic nerve is really swollen, and you better go see a doctor. You might lose your vision. So that's going to save a lot of eyeballs. And it's about the technology we're developing for space.  Host: Yeah, yeah but it's -- the theme is all the same when it comes to spaceflight. It's that autonomy, it's that compactness. It's that level of you know you don't need this gigantic machine and these professionals. That's an incredible idea that you can take something that you needed to dilate your pupil. You needed this big machine, you needed a professional standing right in front of you. And you can just put it in like a -- in your corner store.  Kristin Fabre: The user interface is going to be key. We need to make sure that anybody can use these types of technologies, that you do not have to be medically trained to understand how to use the equipment and what the data means when it comes back. So that's one of our priorities and all of the types of technologies that we consider.  Dorit Donoviel: So, talk about scary. So, my son is just finishing med school, he's going to be an orthopedic surgeon, right.  Host: All right.  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah, and so when I talk about do it yourself medicine, it freaks him out, right? Especially surgery. People talk about surgery in space. So, we're going to send a doctor to Mars for sure. Maybe, it will probably be a surgeon or an emergency medicine doctor because they -- they can do the more complicated things. If somebody breaks something, if somebody has to have an emergency appendectomy, if somebody has a foreign particle in the zero-gravity embedded in their airways, what are you going to do? What are you going to do? So, another project we're kind of excited about is working with a game -- a medical gaming company. So, these people came from like Lucas Films and Disney and Pixar. They're developing games for doctor to train them on procedures, so even doctors who learn how to do things get rusty with procedures. And so, they basically create visualization tools. The doctors could even use on their smart phones. You don't have to have a big station, VR headset or anything like that, you can just use it on your smart phone. And you could practice while you're sitting at the airport waiting for your flight. You can practice removing a foreign object from your airways. You can practice doing a scoping. You can practice doing a certain complicated ultrasound scan. And they made these really fun. They're gaming people so they -- and doctors are very competitive so they're competing with each other on how quickly they got this done without killing the patient or, so they made it extremely realistic. It's based on mathematics and the physical model of physiology. They used -- it's not just a game for fun. It's like based in medicine and physiology and a lot of doctors advise them, so we partnered up with them. We gave them some money. We said make this for zero-gravity. What will this look like in zero-gravity? Because fluids behave differently, tissues behave differently. Organs shift in zero-gravity. You have swelling of tissues. An object will float, you can't just put down your you know, scope and it will stay there. It will actually float away. So, you want to simulate that so that when your geologist is having to do a procedure on the doctor, who inhaled some object, now you could practice, you could actually go through this training and have it be realistic in zero-gravity before you have to do this emergency procedure on the doctor who was supposed to be the one that's helping.  Host: Wow, yeah, I could definitely recognize that application for space. But it also makes me feel pretty good to have doctors just on the ground, regularly fine tuning their skills and competing with each other. It's got to feel good from a patient perspective. That they have that dexterity. That familiarization with their motions to -- in case they need to operate on someone.  Kristin Fabre: And what I love about his example is that this is, as Dorit said their background is gaming. They were not trained scientists. They did not go through the university route. This, these are just people that had a tool that if we could modify it for space, it's a game changer. And that's what I love about how we think at TRISH. You don't have to be a traditional scientist that went down a traditional path to engage with us or for us to invest in you. We just want to see a tool that is going to be a game changer. And this is a great example of how that -- how that came to be.  Dorit Donoviel: And talk about educating them. I mean, they have no idea. And so, we brought in astronauts, we brought in flight surgeons, we brought in space physiologists, we brought in people who work at NASA. We brought in people who've been doing this for years together with this group and together you know, they're making something that's going to be useful and fun and engaging and relevant for NASA with real science and physiology behind it.  Host: That's wonderful. Yeah, I like -- when you talk about thinking about new things and new technologies, who would have thought oh let's bring a gaming -- let's bring some gaming folks on to solve this space health problem.  Dorit Donoviel: Do you want to hear something funny? So most of these guys are young, software engineers or gaming people, right? Like you know the type, right? And their families are all like, “you're just a gamer, we don't even take you seriously. You don't really have a real job.” They're like, \"No we're building tools for doctors.\" But as soon as we came in, all of a sudden, they became legit. You're working with NASA, you must be legit. So, we bring legitimacy. [Laughter]  Host: I love that. I think another theme and I kind of want to end with this, what we're talking about when it comes to space health technologies and you've met -- you've had this term a few times. Mars forward, when you're talking about problems for space, it's not just general spaceflight. You're thinking -- you're thinking ahead. You're thinking man if we're on Mars and you're gone and you're far away and you don't have the right communication, 20-minute communication delays. And you're going to be there for an extended period of time. We're talking three years. These are the problems that you're solving. Tell me about like something coming up in the near future, maybe on the Moon where were definitely looking forward to this Artemis program for NASA returning humans to the Moon. What are we looking forward to that maybe we can apply there, and that is truly Mars forward?  Dorit Donoviel: So, I'll start and then Kristin can give the specific example. So that's a great question, so my understanding right now and speaking with NASA and all of our colleagues is that there's so much that's needed to -- so many resources and money and effort to put boots on the ground on surface of the Moon in 2024. That I think using the Moon as an analog for Mars, which is what we were hoping for is to learn how to do the Mars things on the Moon surface where it's more dangerous than ISS, oh heck yeah. But still close enough to Earth that you can have you know, some -- you could have a medical evacuation if you need to, within two days, two three days you'd be back on Earth. But as we understand it, there's just not a lot of capability that's being built right now. And so, everything is about getting the boots on the ground and not having the -- a place where we can do all the testing of the Mars forward things. So, when NASA is ready for that, we will have the tool box, we're developing a future tool box that we can let them have their pick, whatever you guys need here are the things that we want to test on the Moon and that is forward thinking that in terms of Artemis I really -- there's no specific things that we're building for Artemis. But, Kristin has a great idea of how we're going to use Artemis. So, I’m going to let her finish with that. [Laughter]  Kristin Fabre: So, I'm already thinking about the next steps for these tissue chips that I mentioned earlier, so currently we have the organ on chip solicitation that slide. And we want to see if it's good -- a good analog for human tissue and looking at countermeasures. But I'm already thinking about the next steps. So, a lot of these tissues - they can survive for up to 28 days. But I’d like to see is that if we can expand the tissue viability and have everything automated so that these tissues can survive and be viable and functional for up to six months, and I want to launch these guys onto the Moon. And I want to be able to have everything automated so that I can just pick up my phone and say what's the cytokine expression in the tissues right now? So, can I measure inflammation in the vasculature tissue right now? How is the flow? Are these vasculature tissues being leaky? Can I take an image and look at the -- the cell structure or the tissue structure, does it still look OK? And this way it can be a complete non-invasive way of studying human tissue exposed to GCR and in a way that we can -- that we've never done before. And so, this is really my vision for what we can do with these technologies for TRISH is to take this several steps forward and say let's keep these alive for a long time. That's going to take a lot of ingenuity and engineering to say, how do we use the media? Or what the nutrition that's delivered to these tissues? How do we keep that fresh and relevant? How do we automate all of our censors to see what's going on in these tissues? How do we take images and how does that all going to go back to us on Earth where we can look at it on our phone? But that's exactly the type of mission that TRISH has, and this is a vision I think I get most excited about when I think about these types of technologies at our next steps.  Host: Yeah what I love, what I love about everything that you've mentioned so far is your thinking about all of these areas and you're truly doing your best to try and be innovative, to think of brand-new ways and technologies to solve our problems. But, I think what I'm really getting from this conversation is just how excited the both of you are about all of these incredible technologies. It seems like you love your jobs.  Dorit Donoviel: It's the best job ever. And you know NASA is sometimes bogged down with bureaucracy so to be working with NASA and not to be bogged down by the bureaucracy as much as some of my friends are, is a joy. [Laughter]  Host: Yeah, yeah.  Kristin Fabre: But, it’s also I feel like we get to play in a meaningful way. It's sci-fi come to life. And sometimes we joke around saying, “gosh like we need to be inspired, let's put on our favorite sci-fi movie and see if we can pick something up there.” Because it is, it's a way for us to use our imagination. It's a way for us to look at art and say how can this inspire us in our scientists and our space health community to come up with the next step. So of course, this is going to be a great job. It's -- we really do have fun.  Host: Yeah. Well Dorit and Kristin this was so fun. Thank you so much for coming on.  Dorit Donoviel: It's been a pleasure. Thank you so much.  Kristin Fabre: Thanks Gary. Take care.  Host: Yeah - thank you.  [ Music]  Host: Hey thanks for sticking around. Really fun conversation we had with Dorit and Kristin today about TRISH.

        title: 'Dr. Spaceman',
        description: "Gary Jordan (Host):  Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, episode 56, Dr. Spaceman.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  So, we bring in the experts here.  NASA astronauts, NASA doctors, and sometimes astronaut doctors.  And that's what we're bringing on today.  An astronaut, and a medical doctor.  I need to go back to school.  Okay, so today we're talking with Dr. Mike Barratt, who started his career at NASA as a physician and a flight surgeon.  He flew to the International Space Station twice.  Once on a long duration in 2009, and again in 2011 on Space Shuttle Discovery.  He also served as the manager of the human research program that looks at the most prominent health and performance risks associated with human space flight.  And to figure out what to do about it and make astronauts safe and healthy as possible.  So, today, I talked with Dr. Barratt about the five hazards of human spaceflight.  We work with the human research program to identify these hazards.  We're looking at radiation, isolation and confinement, distance from Earth, altering gravity, and hostile and closed environments.   To give a broad overview of each of them from a medical doctor/astronaut, who has actually flown in space.  So, with no further delay, let's go lightspeed and jump right ahead to our talk with Dr. Barratt.  Enjoy.     [ Music ]    Host: Mike, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today to talk about your story and then, also these hazards.    Mike Barratt: My pleasure.    Host: All right.  So, I kind of want to start with just growing up.  I know you grew up in Washington state.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, so I grew up in kind of a farming community in southwestern Washington.  It was impossibly beautiful; mountains, forests.  Not that far from the ocean, and on the Columbia River.  And it was just a really good upbringing for so many reasons.  But, growing up on the farm, everything broke, and you had to fix it.  And you were always doing chores and getting up early in the morning.  And part of life that I really didn't appreciate until I left it and found others couldn't swing a hammer or turn a screwdriver and realized what an upbringing that was.  But fortunately for a small school, we had some very inspiring teachers.  Those that were very science and socially minded.  And these guys were just incredibly formative in my choice of careers and I guess my lifelong really love of learning.    Host: It was definitely the schooling, then, that really introduced you to the passion in kind of STEM field, then.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, I think so.  It was an interesting time because there were possibilities to do things with your hands that our teachers kind of inspired us to do.  So, I was building telescopes and I was building little habitats for mice to live underwater in the lake that was next to us, which was probably a bad idea for a lot of reasons.  And also, lofting them up in kites.  And so, I think that inspiration just causes you to do things that can do.  And a lot of us did that.  It was just, you know again very formative.    Host: So, how much of that was you playing with sort of equipment and doing kind of these, were you tearing things apart and bringing them back together and that kind of, like that classic kind of engineering thing to do?    Mike Barratt: Yeah, it wasn't so much that I was tearing things apart to see how they worked, it was really trying to build new things to follow an interest.    Host: Interesting.  So, what's interesting about that is you actually went into zoology when you went to college, right.  That was interesting, why zoology.    Mike Barratt: Well, so I think to go upfront a little bit one of the things that characterizes us here in any astronaut office in the Johnson Space Center in general is that we have a lot of broad interests, and we followed a lot of different paths growing up.  And the space program puts that all together.  So, at various times in my life, I wanted only to be an astronomer and I was building telescopes, including grinding mirrors.  Which I'll never do again, but it was a great experience to do.  And marine biology was my passion for several years.  And so, I came out of high school with that as a career goal.  And the University of Washington at the time, they didn't actually have a marine biology track per se, but you could do zoology with a marine emphasis.  And so, that's what I did.    Host: Okay.  Were you still playing around telescopes, then?    Mike Barratt: Absolutely.  There was a lot more light pollution in Seattle than on the farm in southwest Washington.  But sure, I mean I kept all these other passions alive and just looked for a way to combine them a guess.    Host: Yeah, now what's interesting after that, is you know you finding a way to get into this marine biology field, but it was later that you decided to take a turn toward the medical route.  What kind of influenced that?    Mike Barratt: Wow.  Well, the truth of the story is that I met this cute girl in college who was going to medical school and she had that as her focus since she was in third grade.  And so, I decided if I wanted her, I'm going to have to follow her to medical school.  I tell you that's at least half the story.  But, as I was going through biology classes and just learning about the human body, anatomy and physiology and thinking about that in light of some of my other passions.  which were astronomy, and space, and aviation.  I had been through ground school by that time, and marine biology.  I started kind of nurturing this interest in what the human is like in all these different environments.  And so, it seemed to me that medicine might be a place to combine a lot of my interests.  And basically, followed my wife to medical school.  By the way, we just celebrated number 37 here recently, so.    Host: Wow, congratulations.    Mike Barratt: It's been a lot of fun.    Host: All right.  So, you followed the cute girl and then locked her down [laughter].    Mike Barratt: Yeah, absolutely.    >1> Very good.  All right.  So, you're changing your path a little bit and then, eventually it sounds like you're finding different pieces of influence that are kind of taking a left turn on your career path.  You started with this marine biology, now you're going into medicine.  When did you start seeing aerospace medicine?  It sounds like you were a pilot too, so maybe that was part of the influence.  But aerospace medicine.    Mike Barratt: Well, to be sure I'd been through ground school.    Host: Oh, ground school, okay.    Mike Barratt: But I couldn't afford flying lessons.    Host: Oh, I see.    Mike Barratt: But I think life gives us these little seminal events and coincidences and whatnot.  And literally, one day while my soon-to-be wife and I were studying for the medical college admission test.  We were in the library at the University of Washington at the Medical Sciences Library and I got up to wander around for a study break.  And I discovered this journal, which was called \"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine.\"  And it was just sitting in the journal stacks.  I had never heard of the journal.  I had never heard of aerospace medicine.  It was just very intriguing to me.  So, I grabbed one of these and I took it back to my little study carrel and I read it cover to cover.  And I had just never seen anything like this that combined all of these things.  Atmospheric, science, hyperbaric, hypobaric, diving medicine, altitude medicine.  All the extremes were all in one place.  And I probably got about as excited about any medical discovery right then and there as I ever have.   So, interestingly I just started to talk to people and obvious there's no Internet, then.  So, you're finding names and numbers in the phonebook and calling folks and speaking with those who are willing to talk to you, which most of them were.  And that's probably the event that started nurturing that interest in my senior year of college.    Host: What was it about the; you said they were extreme; combining all these extreme elements.  What was that?  What was the extreme part that was intriguing?    Mike Barratt: Well, you're basically looking at the medicine of human performance in places we are not optimally designed to be.  So, high altitude climbers, or war fighters at high altitude.  Divers, how deep can you go?  How do we adapt to different atmospheres?  Radiation?  All these things that induce environmental stresses on people were part and parcel to environments that we've chosen to operate in all these places that I mentioned.  So, the idea of a discipline, of a medical science that takes a very methodical approach to helping people do this I just thought was amazing.  It was about as cutting edge as you could get.    Host: Absolutely is it's entirely about pushing the boundaries of what the human body can; you're pushing it all these different, the word you used was extreme, extreme directions.  How much you know; can it take this amount of pressure?  How high can you go, you know?  What are all these environments that you can really test the human body in?    Mike Barratt: Right, absolutely.    Host: So, at what point did you find that NASA was a possibility.    Mike Barratt: Well, I think for a lot of us, growing up where I did when I did, NASA was this amazing entity that was soundly out of reach for most of us.  It's what the brightest and the best and all the cutting-edge people did.  But as I got a little bit closer into it.  As I got more research done and talked to more and more people, I realized that really the most fascinating aspect of all the environmental medicine out there was space.  It was that the microgravity aspect.  Potentially, hyper gravity when you're launching and landing.  Radiation.  And that just kind of what I wanted to do as I went through medical school.  And I think, you have to choose a medical specialty at the end of four years of medical school.  And I really still didn't know enough about aerospace medicine.  But what I could tell of the literature was that if I knew pathophysiology well it would prepare me the best if I wanted a career in aerospace medicine.  So, I made a deliberate choice to go into internal medicine at Northwestern in Chicago.   Just to learn that.  To really learn pathophysiology, learn how the humans adapt to certain illnesses, and how do we keep people healthy.  Which is a big focus of internal medicine.  And it was during that time that I established some closer ties with the aerospace medicine residency, in particular in Ohio.  Ad did finish up my pilot's license and moonlighting to pay for flying lessons actually.  And just gradually, over the years moved closer and closer to it.    Host: Was this whole pilot thing that you were kind of exploring, was it to, as you were kind of researching and learning about the pushing of the human boundaries, was it wanting to really just kind of see it for yourself maybe a little bit.    Mike Barratt: You know, is was partly that.  I still kind of thought that it was way above me.  But being able to do the medicine aspect of it.  I thought I could do.  And I thought it would be really, really interesting too.  But again, this was a relationship formed over years of talking to people.  And the closer I got, the more I realized that perhaps I could get a toehold in here.  And I absolutely loved flying.  And I think everybody I know that is a pilot is just passionate about being in here and controlling the machine and knowing how we perform up there.  So, this was a natural progression.    Host: Yeah, it's always just kind of described as like a naturally kind of freeing feeling.  You feel above everything.  Really, truly free.  So, you have your residency in internal medicine, now you're exploring aerospace medicine.  And that's where I think it was immediately after your aerospace residency right you kind of transitioned over to NASA.  Through it sounds like talking to those people.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, that's correct.    Host: So, what were you first doing at NASA?    Mike Barratt: So, when I first came down here, I was employed by a contractor which was Krug Life Sciences, at the time, which is now Wyle, KBRWyle to be precise.  But that was at a time when we were still working towards the Space Station Freedom project, which was a Ronald Raegan era, Cold War, massive international project to be done in space.  And already by that time, geopolitical influences were having a big effect on the space program and a lot of our careers.  So, the Cold War was pretty much coming to a close when I first came here in 1991.  And Space Station Freedom was really looked at for its potential contribution, both to science and geopolitical stability.  The day I arrived here, which I believe was in May 1991, the house had just passed by one vote to continue Space Station Freedom in a very limited fashion.  and you could tell that the support for it was waning.  No question about it.  And I came down here as a project physician working on the hyperbaric airlock for Space Station Freedom.   And over the course of that year, the Space Station Freedom Project pretty much folded.  And we anticipated that, we knew that was going to happen.  But there was a lot of misdirection and people were really not sure what was going on.  That was a very good year for me though, in that I realized that whatever training I had had, which was 10 years beyond college, by the way, was not really suitable to start being useful immediately.  There's so much specific knowledge you need down here.  It was easily a year before I felt that I was useful, that I kind of passed the breakeven point and was contributing more than I was learning.  So, in a way that formative year helped me direct myself and helped, at a time that NASA was directing itself, helped us all kind of get on the same page.  And so, I became a NASA flight surgeon in 1992, and at that time we were just starting the US Russian Program.  And I had always been intrigued by the Russian Space Program ever since the Apollo-Soyuz mission that was done during the Cold War and showed what was possibly as corroboration.   And so, when people came and said who would like to go to Russia, or start working with Russia in Spaceflight?  Boy, not too many people raised their hands.  But myself, and another younger flight surgeon at the time were just enthralled by the prospect.  And we started working really 1992/1993 with the joint US Russian program.  And that was probably the biggest influence on the remainder of my career here.    Host: Yeah, so it was kind of your first steps into, or was it actually your first steps into international collaboration, and really travelling?    Mike Barratt: Certainly, for me.    Host: Yeah, so how was that?  That introduction into that world?    Mike Barratt: It was amazing for me.  It was very intriguing to meet our first Russian specialist, that was in 1992.  And I can tell you, Igor Goncharov who I met in 1992.  I started a friendship with and I will just tell you that it went a long time and he was at my landing in 2009 as a recovering medical officer.  It was just an amazing relationship that we formed.  And in 1993, I made my first trip to Russian and was one of the first Americans to be at a Soyuz landing actually at that time.  Now, the irony is that we had already started thinking about using the Soyuz as a rescue vehicle from Space Station Freedom.  And we had originally said, no, it doesn't meet our requirements, and the answer was, well go anyway and see what it's like.  And we've since then, just formed a tremendous amount of respect for that vehicle.  But to be there and to see it.  And to be in Star City at a time when it still wasn't on the maps.  It was still kind of the secret city that everybody knew about in this post-Cold War era, was just an amazing enthralling thing.    Host: Yeah.  You're part of something much bigger.  You're part something kind of worldly I guess.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, we didn't think about that at the time because there were so many things against us.  We thought that our program would crash and burn, but we kept working at it pretty hard.  And it just formed into something big.  So, it was really quite wonderful.    Host: So, through this, you're checking out the international relations.  You're really checking out all of these vehicles and understanding space flight from the flight surgeon perspective.  Now, at what point do you start working with the crew?  Because I know that there's a point here where you start being a crew surgeon as well.    Mike Barratt: Right, so early on, in 1992, we started working with the first Russian cosmonaut, that was Sergei Krikalev, by the way, to fly on a shuttle mission.  And so, since I was already forming ties with the Russian program, I became deputy crew surgeon for that mission.  Which I think it was STS 60.  So, we'll find out.  Ironically commanded by Charlie Bolden.  And that's how I got to know Charlie Bolden pretty well.  And we knew that that was the first part of our exchange program.  That we were flying Russian cosmonauts on shuttle, we were also going to be flying a US astronaut on the Russian Mir Station, that was Norm Thagard as the first person.  And so, my first crew surgeon assignment as deputy on that mission was both an awakening really to what it's like to care for and feed a crew, and to see them end to end.  You're the last to see them before launch, and pretty much the first to see them after landing.  And you're speaking to them every day.  I mean it's really quite exciting.  And it's an amazing part of a flight surgeon's life.  At the same time, healthy sprinkling of the international aspect of what we were doing, the US Russian.   So, for me, those two experiences developed; started and developed together.  And I can't think of taking care of crews that aren't international because of that.  And really that's been quite a wonderful aspect of what we did.  And so, after that mission, we started gearing up more towards flying Norm Thagard on the Mir Station, and he launched in 1995.  So, between those two points, I spent a huge amount of time in Russia.  Like, I think over a year getting ready for it, doing rotations over there, doing medical support for training and the field exercises, survival.  And learn to get certified as a flight controller in the Russian Flight Control Center.    Host: Wow, really expanding your skills kind of all over the place.  You know, we're starting, I'm thinking back to where we started with your interest in marine biology, and now you're going through all these different medicine operations, you're looking at the vehicle itself.  You're kind of all over the place, this is quite fascinating to have such a broad perspective of things.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, well we were young and crazy.  There were, all a team of us actually that included my partner, David Ward, who's also a young flight surgeon interest in Russia.  Peggy Whitson who in charge of the science aspect of our joint US Russian program and I was more the med ops lead.  And John McBrian, who's a legend around here, just a logistics person, well known to the international committee.  And we had this small team that just figured that everything would work out and we just kept busting chops to make it all happen.  And lo and behold, it did.    Host: All right.  Was it this, y our introduction to this kind of broader world and an understanding is that you really realized that astronaut was actually on the table?    Mike Barratt: Actually, it was probably even later than that.    Host: Really?    Mike Barratt: We flew the first mission, and it went very well.  Not without a hitch, but it went very well.  Of a US astronaut in the Mir Station.  And the more I worked with Russia, the more I worked with long-duration, the more I realized that in the big picture of space flight, of exploration, of human expansion if you will.  Long-duration flight is how we're going to get somewhere.  And in some ways, it was much more intriguing to me than the short duration shuttle flights that we were doing.  Now, these were fantastic, make no mistake.  These were short, and dense, and science packed, and very high profile.  It looked like people were having a lot of fun.  But the kind of the brute force reality of how the human adapts to weightlessness over months, of longer periods of times, commensurate with a deep space crew's phase to Mars, for instance.  That's what really started to intrigue me.  So, it was a combination of that and my role as an educator, if you will.  Teaching the astronauts what their body is going to do in space.   So, in some ways, I kind of felt a little bit like a dork saying you know this is what's going to happen to your body in space, but I've never been there so trust me.  This is just what we know based on best available information and best stories we get from you guys.  So, I realized that to fulfill my ultimate dream of understanding space medicine, I would really have to go there myself.  So, I put my hat in the ring first for the 1998 selection.  And I was massively busy at the time.  And really just put that in very quickly.  And I did interview at that time.  I did not day get in.  But I wasn't dissuaded and just kept it in there.  I still didn't have any inkling that I would get accepted, that still seemed quite a bit out of reach to me.  But that in the year 2000, well lo and behold, I got picked.    Host: Wow.  All right, so that must have been quite an achievement for you to put it in a second time and finally get that call.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, well, there were certainly people got on their first time.  And people who got in after six times.  And so, I felt incredibly lucky, no question about it.    Host: So, going through the training, and we've talked about astronaut training a lot on this podcast.  But, you know, a lot from you have a different perspective, being a flight surgeon first and understanding how the human body reacts and what you're really training for, especially from a human research sort of perspective.  What was your perspective as a flight surgeon turned astronaut, as you were going through the training, kind of maybe you had a different perspective than maybe other astronauts in your same class too.    Mike Barratt: Well, sure everybody comes with sets of perspectives.    Host: Sure.    Mike Barratt: There's no question, based on their experience and their impressions.  I will tell you that I missed my old job tremendously.    Host: Oh, really?    Mike Barratt: For the first few years.  Don't get me wrong, it was exciting to be in the astronaut office and I had an amazing class.  The 17-member class of 2000.  Best class ever, in fact.  But wow.  I was gearing up to get the medical system going for the ISS, which launched the first crew that same year.  And so, after years and years of work and anticipation, and putting this all together, knowing the crews.  Working with them in Russia.  The US and the Russian crews and other international folks.  All of a sudden, right on the cusp of launch I'm yanked away into the astronaut office.  So, that was not easy.  I will be very upfront about that.  But, yes indeed I had a different perspective because I knew a little bit more about how the human performs.  And I knew Russia.  And I knew Russian.  And there were a lot of aspects of the program that were very familiar to me.  However, everybody comes with their own skillsets and deficits.  And I'm not an engineer.  So, a lot of what you're learning is systems engineering in Astro 101.   So, we had to learn shuttle systems and station systems.  And that there were certainly places where I was at an advantage.  Those were not them.  And so, certain things I could skip out of class and other things I had to work twice as hard as my classmates.    Host: Yeah, now that's actually an interesting perspective.  Because a lot of astronauts you talk to now, I mean Russian is one of the hardest things to learn.  Just because you know, they've lived in the engineering time for a long time and getting used to that is maybe a little bit easier than it is for you.  But you've actually had the Russian training.  And so, extra Russian training was just, you know.  Yeah, I guess it was a little bit easier of a transition than learning something out of, I guess your field.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, to a point.  I think medical people are used to memorizing big reams of information quickly and used to communicating.  And I was kind of a language dweeb anyway.  So, I thought, yeah, I got this great advantage.  I speak Russian.  Well, that was an advantage for about 400 milliseconds when we started learning all the other stuff.  The engineering and whatnot.  Obviously, I did not have the advantage.  So, we balanced each other out I think, quite well.    Host: Yeah, now you're going through the training and then you finally launch to the International Space Station.  Your first mission is on a Soyuz and it's a long-duration mission.  It's one of the expeditions you were talking about.  Where you're up on the station for a long time.  Now being a flight surgeon turned astronaut, what was that experience like for you?    Mike Barratt: Well, that was in 2009.  I'll preface that by saying I had actually finished and released the first edition of a textbook on space medicine the year before I launched in 2008.  So, this is \"Principles of Clinical Medicine for Spaceflight.\"  It's not a \"New York Times\" Bestseller.  I'm sure you've never heard of it.  But it did the best we could at the time to put a standard of care together for space medicine.  And I had some very talented authors who are you know cutting-edge in the research and the practice of their time.  And so, I launched with a lot of anticipation, thinking did I get this all right.  What's it really going to be like when I get up there?  What's the personal experience going to be like?  And maybe 6.5 months later into flight I could say I got about 80% right.  About 85% right.  And knowing that there's a big chasm between the book learning, which you may see realized and the personal experience.  Which is often quite a bit more visceral and personal than you can describe in the book.   So, I was going up there with a naturalist's eye.  Trying to look at myself and look at others to see what adaptation was really like.  And so, I think partly there were days where I thought, yeah, we got this right.  And pats on our backs and we're going to make this.  And then there were other days where, boy we sure didn't see that coming.  We had no idea.    Host: Yeah, now 20% that's a decent chunk.  Now, living it, there's all these things that you can anticipate, and research, and find out.  But once you live it, it kind of surprises you.  What were some of the things that really kind of, what was that 20%?  That 20% that really surprised you?    Mike Barratt: Well, one thing right off was how well we adapt to be three-dimensional creatures.  We have known that we don't understand how the balance system, neuro vestibular organs and other parts of your body that determine your sense of position, your sense of motion control, mass handling.  We knew that we didn't really understand the mechanisms of that adaptation.  And that we thought that to be a particular hazard that people could potentially get disoriented and cause erroneous commands.  Because we're not aware of our positional since when we're either docking a vehicle or manning a robotic arm.  In reality, over a period of days to weeks, we adapt incredibly well to be three-dimensional.  We don't know how.  In fact, you could almost say we don't know why we can do this.  But after a period of a few weeks, and I think it takes about six weeks for a first-time flyer.  We enter this stage of what my friend Shannon Lucid coned deep adaptation.  Whereby you go into a module that's clocked differently and you can immediately change your reference frame.   Or, you find people that just move upside down in a module and take their reference frame with them and are incredibly comfortable with this new three-dimensional environment or can manage things in three dimensions.  You don't just put something down on the table, it will float away.  But you're always mindful of where that thing is in three dimensions.  There's many other aspects to that, but we adapt quite amazingly to three dimensions, much more deeply than I would have thought possible.  But really, the bit thing was, when I was flying, we kind of started breaking the story on a new entity, which has been called many things, vision impairment and cranial pressure, and now more recently spaceflight associated neuro ocular syndrome.  But it was during our mission, myself, and one of my crewmates who's also a physician Bob Thirsk, noticed that our near visual acuity was decreasing, deteriorating and we needed stronger magnification to read our checklists.  And we heard stories of this before.  We knew that we often had to fly glasses of stronger magnification for people.   We just didn't know why.  In fact, we call them anticipatory glasses, but we didn't know why.  So, we got out the old ophthalmoscope, which is this little item that helps you see the back of someone's retina.  And said, are we not physicians after all?  Let's take a look at each other.  And lo and behold, it looked like there was a little bit of swelling of the optic disc for both of us.  And we did some other tests onboard.  And our ground crew fast-tracked some other equipment to us, high resolution imagery of the retina actually was what we really needed, and they gave us a little camera to do that within six weeks, which is a record.  And we started unwrapping the whole constellation of findings that go with this syndrome that was really not described until that time.  So, while we're up there, we're finding these findings like flattening of the globe of the eye, which changes your focus, which is a lot of why our near vision was deteriorating.  We found swelling of the optic nerve sheath.  The coating around the optic nerve.  We found changes in the retina and little bits of swelling of the optic disc.   And these are big things.  These are huge things.  And the question is, is this Bob and Mike and something that's going on with them?  Or is this something that we've missed for all these years and now we have the tools to see it/ Well, as it turns out it's the latter.  And when you think about it, this is such a large thing that's no doubt a manifestation of adapting to zero gravity that we just were seeing for the first time.  What else is out there that we're missing?  This is a big thing.  It effects very crucial parts of a person's anatomy.  And what else are we missing that we just haven't had the tools to find?  So, it was both a discovery and a realization that there's still much more to learn.  So, I think when I landed, I probably landed with even a bigger gap in the space medical knowledge than what I thought after maybe the first half of the mission that I was there.    Host: Yeah, more questions than answers.  Kind of opens up this whole idea of yeah, right what else is happening?    Mike Barratt: Right, and by the way, that has been our second largest risk now, next to radiation, it's one of our largest focuses of research since that time.    Host: Is that vision studies?    Mike Barratt: Yeah, absolutely.    Host: Yeah, yeah.  No, well just from what you're describing, I mean there's a little bit of a positive and a negative right, the three-dimensional space.  You're like what is happening to the vestibular system that's whether you know you're oriented, how you do your balance, but it seems like you can navigate better than you originally thought.  Upside down.  You know where you're going, you know where things are better than you originally thought.  So, I guess that's a positive thing.  But the vision thing, that's going to be a challenge.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, and by the three-dimensional awareness, you pay for that when you come home.  Because you have to adapt the other direction, and what makes you incredibly adaptive in space becomes very maladaptive on day one when you land.    Host: That's right.  And this will be a consideration for space travel too.    Mike Barratt: Absolutely.    Host: Because you're going to have to realize that you're going from one environment, which maybe you know zero gravity, microgravity, whatever in transit to a planet.  And then, once you land now you have to adapt to the gravity of this new planet.  And so, does your balance.    Mike Barratt: Right, absolutely.    Host: So, you had a couple spaceflights and had these realizations.  Now during the long-duration spaceflight what was the comparison to your next flight, the short duration?    Mike Barratt: Well, interestingly, I was assigned to the short duration flight before I landed from first long-duration flight.  So, I knew I was going to have that data point.  And it was a totally different vehicle.  So, it was more than just the short duration in space.  The launch, and landing, the vibe of that mission, the STS 133 was totally different.  Everything was in English.  Everything was at home.  I didn't have to travel.  And I had this amazing crew of people.  And we were asked to be chosen to be that the last space shuttle crew.  And we had our pictures taken with Bob Crippen and John Yong as the first space shuttle crew.  And we were lining up all that PR aspect of it all.  Lo and behold Congress wanted two more shuttle missions after that.  Which did a couple things.  It meant that we weren't the last, but it also took all the pressure and spotlight off of us and made for a very relaxed training flow.  And the mission was just absolutely fabulous.  But I'll tell you, it was great to launch in the shuttle.  It's a very different vehicle.  It was quite an honor, actually, to be on one of those last shuttle missions.   And to have that much room during the two-day chase.  It's quite a bit larger than the Soyuz.  And to be back on station again felt like a homecoming to be real honest.  It was about a year and a half between when I landed from the long one and when we launched.  Not quite a year and a half.  But when we opened the hatch, it just felt so familiar.  It felt like a homecoming in many ways.  I knew my way around.  I knew how to get from one handrail to another.  I know where you could go fast, where you needed to go slow.  Where the food was.  I mean the aroma when we opened the hatch was so familiar, it just felt like home and so that was really an amazing aspect of it.  And it was busy.  It was a two-week dock time period almost.  We had a 13-day mission altogether.  It's an interesting perception for some people that the shuttle missions were sprints and the station missions were marathons.  I do like to remind people that a marathon means you're still running.  And when we had our visiting shuttle missions, which were two of them when I was on my long flight.   We were actually working longer days than our shuttle counterparts for all sorts of reasons.  But, again, you're very effective when you've been up there for months.  You can get a lot done in a day.  And we've all kind of seen that now.  And so, I thought about that a lot as a visiting shuttle member, subsequently, that I wanted to be a good guest.  And that we wanted to make sure that we were all working together as a team and not be burdensome on the station crew.  And I think that was a good realization at the time.  But otherwise, it was just fabulous.  There were about 12 of us on the station.  Very international crew.  Russians, US, an Italian, Paolo Nespoli.  And a really fabulous mission.    Host: Incredible.  So, Mike with that, you actually have some experience in HRP.  We were working with HRP now to put together sort of the way they've done it, is they've categorized hazards of human spaceflight into five different hazards.  And I guess they are sort of environmental hazards.  They did it based on radiation, isolation, confinement, distance from Earth, altered gravity fields, and then the last one is a hostile or closed environment.  And it's sort of how this effects the human body, which you know, since you've actually been in space, but then also worked with HRP.  So, let's just go through those hazards and just sort of expand on that starting with radiation.  The radiation environment of space.  Why is that a hazard to us?    Mike Barratt: Okay, well, all of these physical hazards kind of account for the physiological changes and the medical changes we see.  Each one of them cascades down along several lines, which can cause changes and sometimes harmful effects to us .  Radiation is an interesting phenomenon because we sometimes think of space as being filled with radiation.  When really, the correct way to think about that is Earth being a hardened shelter to radiation.  We just happen to live and grow up in this bunker.  Which shields us from what the rest of the universe is bathed in all the time.  And so, if we want to be space farers, then radiation is just a fact of life.  It's how we're going to get somewhere.  Radiation can hurt us on many levels.  We worry about solar flares, which can cause a large number of particles, charged particles, protons, electrons, alpha particles, which can actually cause acute radiation sickness.  And depending on the dose, that can be very mild, like you never notice it.  Or can be lethal.   Everything in between.  And then we worry about long-term risk of cancer and increased risk of heart disease.  And some other things as well.  Including effects on the brain.  So, there's many ways that radiation can hurt us, but it is one thing that we absolutely have to solve.  And when you think about being a spacefaring civilization, multi-planet, you have to envision yourself moving from one bunker to another.  So that what we have on Earth that shields us from a lot of electromagnetic radiation, cosmic rays and solar particles, we will need to re-create the best we can, wherever we're going.  And so, for places without atmospheres and magnetic fields, will depend much more on matter, on say burrowing underground to get some material that shields us from that for most of the time that we live there.    Host: Yeah, you're literally using, I guess the plant itself to sort of protect you, because there's especially, you know, you're talking about Earth being a bunker, you've got the magnetic field that's really protecting you.  But on Mars, not so much.  On the moon, not so much.  Yeah, you're not going to have that same protection.    Mike Barratt: Right, so unfortunately, the places of interest to us don't shelter us quite as much as mother Earth.  And I think it's a good point that finding a Goldilocks planet that affords everything they we're used to as we grew up and developed here is pretty unlikely.  So, we'll be settling for aspects of the fundamental aspects that we live under that we can live with and then try to make up for those that we don't have.  So, radiation shielding might be one of those.    Host: So, let's start with sort of low Earth orbits, since that's actually where you did spend some time.  What's the difference between the radiation environment of low Earth orbit, and say around the moon?    Mike Barratt: Well, so in low Earth orbit, you're above the atmosphere, which is highly protective of radiation.  So, you lose that.  However, you are still underneath the magnetic fields, the geomagnetic fields that protect our planet are held in place.  They're basically, I think of it as a fire shield.  It's basically charged particles held in a magnetic field that if you get too close to you get burned, but the fire keeps the bad things away.  So that the high energy galactic cosmic rays are largely stopped by that geomagnetic field, certainly at the latitudes of the orbits that we fly in.  So, that's very helpful.  Once you get out of those magnetic fields, then you are vulnerable to the full force of galactic cosmic rays and solar particle events.  In fact, from a human standpoint, we sometimes consider that extra-geomagnetic space.  Because it gives you that clear delineation that we are now outside of our little shielded area.    Host: So, what exactly?  You said, you know, from small effects to you know lethal effects of radiation.  What exactly is radiation doing to the human body?    Mike Barratt: So, when we think about spaceflight radiation, we're mostly concerned with charged particles, which are electrons, and protons, and some heavier particles that are basically stellar products coming from supernova explosions and energized gas clouds.  And the I'll have to caveat that by saying we also have issues with neutrons.  Because those can be formed by interaction of these heavy particles with structure.  But these are traveling very fast.  And they possess a lot of energy.  And so, when they hit something that's of value to us, such as macromolecules, like DNA, they can actually induce direct damage.  And if you get a large enough dose they can actually kill cells.  It's some of those smaller doses that we're a little bit concerned about.  Because they can damage DNA in such a way, in fact many different ways that can potentially cause cancers, cause the lethality from cancers.  Many years after your exposures.  And there's a lot of uncertainty about what does and what charged particle will affect, will cause what effect on the human body.   And so, that's one of our major areas of interest in research.    Host: Do we have radiation studies on the International Space Station?    Mike Barratt: Absolutely.  So, just like a radiation technologist or nuclear energy worker, we have a very highly monitored environment.  And every crew there were the radiation badge just like any of those people in those industries that I mentioned.  We have area detectors which map out the radiation exposure of each area of the Space Station.  And we have, furthering our suite of detectors, charged particle directional detectors.  Which tell you what the charges are and from what direction they come.  And those are the particles that that come in from the sun and from galactic cosmic rays.  And of course, we have our ground observations.  We composite all those together, along with satellite data as well.  And we get the best picture we can of the radiation environment for low Earth orbit.    Host: So, sticking with the International Space Station, moving on to this this next hazard, which is isolation and confinement.  This is an interesting one, because you are isolated, and I guess confined on the Space Station.  It's a relatively large structure, especially for a space structure and historically the ones that we've actually flown on.  But how is you know, how is that an isolated and confined environment and then versus what we can be looking towards for future missions?    Mike Barratt: Well, it's an interesting question because when we look at the ISS as a space platform it is, by far the largest space platform we've ever had.  And are likely to have for a long, long time.  You know I lived on the Space Station for nearly 200 days in 2009.  And really loved living there.  There's no question about it.  But I was lucky enough to come back in about a year and a half.  And one of my classmates, Steve Bowen was with me.  And he is a submariner by training.  He was a Navy officer on the Virginia Class attack boats.  And he and I flew around the station the first day after we had docked the Shuttle Discovery to it.  And I just asked him, if this were one of your submarines, how many people would you have been in a volume this size.  And he thought for a minute and said about 130, or so.  So, our standard crew size on the station is six.  And boy, and we have zero gravity, which means you can use the volume in three dimensions.  So, we really have it pretty good up there.  So, there's many aspects that make the station extremely habitable.   Largely its size, it's big and there's plenty of space.  If you want privacy you can have it.  It's possible to go for hours without seeing another person, if you are very concentrating on an experiment or doing some of your work that just keeps you in one place for long time.  The other thing about it though, is that if you look out the window you have this magnificent view of mother Earth.  And so, there's a bigness and there's a closeness.  And not only are you overwhelmed by the proximity of the Earth, you also know that you can get there fairly quickly if you need to.  If, God forbid we ever had an emergency on the station, it caught fire and became uninhabitable, we know we can be home within hours.  And safely.  And that gives you a lot of comfort and it gives you a lot of closeness to Earth.  So, it is large, and confined in that you can't go outside anytime you want.  You can't always just come home anytime you want.  But still you have those factors I mentioned that make it very habitable.  Now, one other point I like to make is people think we're a long way away, and they use the term outer space.   Even my mom said I was in outer space for six months.  But you know, we're not that far away.  I mean, we're 240 nautical miles above the surface.  Which is about I don't know, maybe a little more than from here to Austin.  And what separates us is not so much that distance barrier, as a speed barrier.  A velocity barrier.  Because to be in orbit, we're traveling 17,500 miles an hour.  And we had to accelerate to get there.  And, conversely, to come home, we have to decelerate.  We have to slow down from 17,500 to 0.  And so, it's really not the distance barrier so much as the speed barrier that that separates us.  And that will become very different when we break orbit and I head for Mars.    Host: Did you ever feel isolated on the Space Station, or maybe because it's so close that maybe you felt pretty connected.    Mike Barratt: I think that the only times I ever felt isolated up there was when I knew there were events going on on the ground that I really wanted to be a part of.  Mostly family events.  Other than that, not really for two reasons.  You know, number one, all those habitability factors that I mentioned.  But number two, where you are is just so magical.  I mean, it captivates you.  You are mostly feeling how amazing it is to be where you are and feel what you're feeling and see what you're seeing than you are wishing that you were elsewhere.    Host: So, you said, I mean there was only six people on this giant spacecraft, and you had a lot of rooms and you had three dimensions of room too, you know you don't have to worry about just walking on the floor, you have all surfaces to work with.  So, confinement doesn't really seem like much of an issue from your perspective on the Space Station.  Now, if you're going further out, is there an optimal level of space, I guess that you would need as a human to operate and feel comfortable in the spacecraft for long-duration missions?  Especially on a Mars transit that can go somewhere up to nine months in a single spacecraft without really having the ability to go outside for a walk and some fresh air.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, that's a great question.  I think it's safe to say just holistically that as soon as you break orbit and head for Mars, all those habitability factors start going downhill for all sorts of reasons.  Now of the Station is huge.  It's much larger than anything we would be throwing to Mars or any other exploration venue anytime soon.  And at the Human Research Program level we actually had a research focus on what we called minimum habitable volume.  In other words, what's the minimum we would need to maintain a crew's health and performance in some of these deep space conditions.  Now, I will point out that there is no maximum habitable volume that we're trying to determine.  So basically, the bigger the better.  That's not our problem.  That's not the end where we have our issues.  Obviously to throw a mass to Mars is going to be highly constraining.  And so, the ship that goes to Mars, not only will it be truly isolated, you can't be home in several hours.  There is no real-time communication.  You don't have that tremendous view of mother Earth, always there just making you feel connected to your home planet, but your volume will be quite small by necessity.   And coming up with that minimal habitable volume is a bit of a daunting task because there's a certain amount of subjectivity to it.  So, the answer is from a habitability standpoint as big as possible, but that will be severely constrained.  And so, what I think we'll get is a reasonable volume envelope based on the mass we're able to throw, and the life-support systems we have to accommodate.  And with that volume, we'll try our best to make it as habitable as possible.    Host: Now you have to assume that the astronauts going on that mission to Mars are going to be, you can assume the best of the best.  They're going to be a great crew; well, we can hope [laughter], we can home.  And they're going to be able to get along with each other and I think that's a big component as well is being confined in a space where mass is a huge constraint, space is a huge constraint for these long-duration missions.  Now, you're not only talking about confined, habitable volume and livable volume, but livable volume with other people.    Mike Barratt: Right, that's absolutely right.  But I think that a couple of things.  You will be building expectations of the crew that goes to Mars in a way that will prepare them for this experience.  And they'll know what they're getting into.  Just as we do on Space Station.  And NASA has been working very hard to develop training scenarios that build these expeditionary behaviors.  One of those is coping with relatively small volumes.  And getting along with each other.  There's no question about it that you will have to do some special preparation.  But I'm actually fairly confident that that is something we can do.  Because that's been done in history before.  Certainly, in Arctic stations and small oceangoing craft, we've proven as a species that we can tolerate fairly austere conditions as long as we're prepared and can get along with it.  Now, I think building some degree of privacy is prudent.  But I think we can do that in a much smaller space than we have with the ISS.    Host: Okay.  Now in terms of isolation, as you get further and further away from Earth so does the time it takes to communicate with Earth.  On Space Station, it's relatively easy, almost instantaneous, really close to it.  So, talking with people is easy.  As you go further and further away now you have this delay.  Is there a certain level of; well we'll start with this.  Is there a certain level of communication that's needed to maintain the crew's health?  And feeling like they're still connected and not so far away from Earth?    Mike Barratt: I think that as we move towards exploration of deep space we have to actually look backward not forward for the answers to some of these problems.  Now, if you were to look at what I consider one of the greatest voyages of discovery of all time, Captain Cook's circumnavigation aboard Endeavor, where they were lucky to find a merchant ship or a whaleship that might be going to their homeport, maybe years into their voyage.  The crew would draft some letters hand that to them and hold that the ship would make it there safely sometime in the next year.  And that letter writing campaign was kind of how things were done.  If you were to tell them they, hey look, we've got a system where given a few minutes to several hours you can get a message back to Greenwich and then they can communicate with you before the day is out.  They wouldn't have believed you.  So basically, what we have is a revolutionary capability compared to the means that supported exploration missions for centuries.   And so, can we do it?  Of course, we have.  We can do that.  Now, we have to crew, and we have to design accordingly.  And really move toward more mission autonomy.  And we've spoiled ourselves in a way, by having such broad bandwidth and real-time communication for the Station.  But Station is a laboratory.  And it is designed to produce as much science as possible.  And that really depends on a real-time communication, whereas heading to Mars and some of the other deep space destination, we're not in that paradigm.  We are really all about exploring and what we need to do in maintaining the ship, and maintaining the crew, and supporting the mission.  Most of that responsibility has to really be given to the crew.  Certainly, for any immediate responses that need to happen, that all has to be the crew.  Just like it used to be.    Host: Yeah, and it blends in nicely to this to his next hazard, which is distance from Earth.  And I think, you know, we sort of already talked about that the further you are away, the more delay there is communication.  So, communication is one of the factors that goes hand-in-hand with distance.  The further out you go, the longer the delay of communication.  What are some other factors whenever you're talking about the human body, the human really being further, and further, father away from Earth.    Mike Barratt: Well, I think there's that many aspects to that.  One I have to kind of think about the medical issues that we know our crews are going to be healthy when we launch them and we're going to do our best to keep them healthy during flight with countermeasures and diet and medical monitoring.  But if an acute event happens, somebody for instance starts clutching their lower abdomen and peeing out blood and we think there's a kidney stone, you know that could definitely happen.  So, in this case, instead of getting a panic call to the ground, asking immediately to talk to the surgeon, what we may get is a report saying, crew member so and so was clutching their abdomen, in very bad pain.  We pulled out the ultrasound, we found a stone.  We think it's passing.  We've given pain meds and they're resting comfortably.  That's the kind of paradigm that we're moving to.  So, that the crew members, again, are able to respond to an event and handle it the best they can.  And give us reports and ask for advice.  So, to speak.  Consultation, rather than real-time guidance.  And that again, is very exploration-oriented.   And if we have a whatever, settlement, or colony, or outpost n on Mars, that's the paradigm.  So, that begins with the exploration transit.    Host: Yeah, there's a lot of factors that go into that.  Now, you have another base of knowledge that you have to have a baseline for whenever you go out.  Because instead of calling immediately to the ground like you said and getting the aid, the knowledge of the experts on the ground instantly.  Now you have to know sort of what to deal with.  And then, that mentality of not working together, the mentality of doing it yourself, and reporting the progress.    Mike Barratt: Which, truth be told, I think even crew members on Station right now, we understand that we're trying hard to produce science and having more consultation with the ground is really important.  But more crew autonomy is recommended by almost every crew who returns from Station.  Partly to enhance efficiency and partly for peace of mind.  But it is something that crew members really, I think naturally want and will move into quite nicely.  I have to think, I had a very small combustion event on the Space Station while I was up there, really almost nonconsequential.  But that piece of hardware on the Russian segment started bellowing smoke and overheating.  And of course, we were able to immediately call the ground.  And they knew about it immediately because of smoke detectors and whatnot.  And in this paradigm, it would have been a call back that maybe they would have found out between 8 and 22 minutes later that we have this little combustion event.  We pulled the circuit breakers.  This is what we found.  Everything is fine now.  We replaced the part that was burning, and we are in normal ops recovery.   How was your day.  So, again that's kind of the paradigm that we'll get to with exploration.    Host: Now, as we also go further out, you're talking about sort of your trajectory to get there is not flexible.  So, if you're going to Mars, that's it.  If you already lit your engines and you're on your way to mars, that's it, there's no turning back if there's something.  So, I'm assuming that that's part of living in that sort of environment, is knowing that once you're on your way to Mars, you're dedicated.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, absolutely.  And that, again, is something you prepare crews for ahead of time, that when you light those engines for your trans-Mars injection, there is a state of readiness at all levels.  All of your systems and your crew as well.  And so, that decision has already been made once those engines fire.  And that expectation is burned in.  And you know, there's an understanding that it will be a long trip, and you can't turn around, and you can't sightsee, or pull off to the side.  But that's mixed with the anticipation that you're going to Mars.  And that's pretty cool.    Host: Yeah, that is pretty cool.  And magical.  It's really, just to know that you're on your way is a fantastic step.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, absolutely.    Host: So, you know, based on that let's go to topic number for, which is altered gravity fields.  You're talking about for the International Space Station microgravity is what you're really operating.  Now, you've got sort of a similar environment on the way to Mars, but then you have to adjust on this six to nine-month journey to Mars, you have to adjust from that gravity, now down to Mars' gravity.  And we've learned from operating on the International Space Station and doing these long-duration missions that there's some significant effects on the human body whenever you're talking about gravity.    Mike Barratt: Right, well there certainly are.  So, it's very interesting because we grew up in one G, one gravity.  And our human body is quite amazing in its capacity to handle different orientations to gravity.  We lie down, we stand up and we maintain our blood pressure to our brain.  We maintain fluid regulation.  We're able to move with different loads.  We can run.  We can walk.  We can swim.  We're really quite amazing.  And when you get into zero gravity, the fact that we adapt to zero gravity is also quite amazing.  But it's a little bit easier to go from one G to zero G. Because you're going from a loaded state to an unloaded state and your balance gets wacked, but you can't fall because nothing falls up there.  It actually becomes a lot more exciting when you come from zero gravity back to 1G.  Now, the good news is that of the main problems that result from prolonged exposure to microgravity, and those being musculoskeletal weakness and problems with your heart pumping blood to your head, to your brain.   Which is what we call orthostatic tolerance, the ability to handle that gravitational challenge on your blood column and balance.  Two out of those three, we've actually made tremendous progress on over these years.  Largely because of some of the work we've done on the International Space Station.  So, because of our new countermeasures; heavy resistive exercise, heavy aerobic exercise, we come down pretty fit and strong.  And we have people coming down after six months with negligible bone loss.  Sometimes a few percent but certainly we're in a bracket now that has kind of revolutionized our understanding of maintaining a body in zero gravity.  And we have countermeasures for the orthostatic intolerance, which is caused by some of those adaptive changes; low circulating blood volume and lower red blood cells, and the conditions that in zero gravity decondition your neural circuits that let you stand up.  We have countermeasures.  We can fluid load.  We can increase your vascular volume a little bit.   We put on garments that squeeze our legs and keep the fluid where we want.  And there's other things we can do.  Interestingly, the balance issues that come from problems with our vestibular organs, which are our balance organs, and many other inputs that your brain integrates to determine where you are and what your motions like, those are things we don't really have countermeasures to.  And interestingly, now we're worrying quite a bit about those.  But I am amazed that we have the luxury of worrying really just about that one, whereas, we used to worry about three pretty handily.  So, not to trivialize that.  That is a big issue.  It's very difficult to move, to walk to do some of the most simply motor functions after a prolonged period in zero gravity.  Now, the good news is that the Mars is less gravity.  It's a little bit more than 1/3 of Earth's gravity.  And the big adaptive phase where it's very difficult to walk and whatnot, is a fairly short one on the order of a few days.   Certainly, several hours to a few days.  And so, we can wait it out, if we're careful and our landing craft on Mars is big enough to allow us to stick around.  And there may be some countermeasures that we can still develop.  And if the gravity field is quite a bit less, which one would expect would lessen the implications of it, and certainly would lessen the chances of injury on falling.  But one thing is you cannot expect people to land, put on their spacesuit and hike 5 kilometers to the lander that you've pre-staged there within the first few hours.    Host: So, there's going to have to be, built into the mission, and probably the hardware too, some sort of period of adaptation whenever you land on Mars to sort of, and you're talking about the order of a couple of days it seems like, to sort of get your new land legs, your Mars legs before you actually exit the capsule and start, like you said, put on your spacesuit and start walking around.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, that is a certainty.  I think a period of postlanding adaptation is an absolute certainty, which unfortunately drives a larger sized lander.  So, that does change your mission architecture.  Until, or unless we develop some type of magical countermeasure to those neuro vestibular problems that we are going to need to have.  And frankly, I don't think we have anything definitive on the horizon for that.  You cannot load yourself out of this problem, like you can with muscle and bone loss, and even blood loss.  You can load those back.  But this we can't.  And it's more than just the post landing period.  We've also wondered what are the human capabilities for piloting a spacecraft through the atmosphere of Mars, and that is very highly dependent on motor function.  And we definitely saw with the shuttle missions, which were short, but we definitely found that even the longer of the shuttle missions, which would have been a little over two weeks in duration, you could correlate with slightly decrease performance on manual landing tasks of the shuttle.  And we know that accumulates over time.   So, months and months of spaceflight, that's probably not a good time you want to have manual control of a spacecraft entering the atmosphere.    Host: Now, let's say you land on Mars and you've gone through this adaptation period.  Now your neuro vestibular system is back in balance and you're able to walk.  Is there still, I'm assuming, there might be exercise requirements whenever you're on the surface of Mars.  You still have 1/3 G and you have that constant load, but I'm assuming, you know, regular exercise will still be helpful, I wonder just how much.    Mike Barratt: Well, that's a great question.  So, we exercise in zero gravity, mostly because we know we're coming home.  I mean zero gravity is great, unless you want to come home.  And so, keeping bones and muscles, and cardiovascular system conditioned is really all about coming back to your home planet.  And it will be the same on Mars that you will absolutely want to exercise.  Because you know that eventually you want to come back to 1G, until we end up staying there for a little bit longer.  Now, the good news is that 1/3 of a G is quite a bit more than zero.  It's quite a bit more than lunar G. But, the important mechanical aspect of that is that it's all, we would say linear.  It's basically the center of the planet, there's a line between that and your belly button, your center of mass, around which you're going to orient your body, and carry loads, and do your exercises.  So basically, it's like being in familiar territory, you just have to dial up the loads more than you would have on the ground.   So, that if you had a universal gym, you just rack in more weights.  More likely we'll have bags of Martian regolith and we'll just pack those and lift those.  But it's all along the same vector that we're used to.  So, it vastly simplifies your performance of countermeasures.    Host:  Oh, that's right because instead of bringing weights with you, you use kind of the environment around, because mass is a huge concern just to get there.    Mike Barratt: Right, there's plenty of mass there, and we often, we think about artificial gravity in long transits in deep space and giving us that rotational centrifugal force which would put back some of those gravitational forces.  That's problematic in a lot of ways, with a spinning structure.  But once you get on the surface, you've got fractional gravity, but it's all linear, it's kind of nature's way, if you will.  So, that gives us something much easier to work with.    Host: Yeah, now how about, just real quick, you know, Mars mission there's a lot of concerns but we've already been to the moon.  Now, if you're talking about a moon, you know, let's say we have a habitat on the moon and we're living there for long-duration missions to sort of test out going even further out.  Now, what would that look like as compared to you know, adjusting from gravity.  Because the trip is much, much shorter.    Mike Barratt: Well, it's true we've already been to the moon, but you could also say that's similar to say, we've already been in low Earth orbit during the Gemini period.  And so, we knew that people could handle the environment and that most likely they could go longer.  But boy, there was a lot we didn't know until we start flying people long duration on Skylab and the Russian programs.  Mir station and ISS> so, the same will be true with the lunar gravity.  We will be able to work quickly there.  We'll be able to walk and explore.  We know that because of Apollo.  What we don't know really is what are the long-term effects of 16G and what are the countermeasures that we will in turn need.  And we'll add all sorts of other hazards with that.  There will be a vigorous EVA schedule.  Which is why we're there.  We're there to explore.  But it will be there in a gravity field with dust, and sharp edges, and tools, and all sorts of things that don't have to worry about with spacewalks on the Station right now.  And so there will be many different and new levels of hazard that we will have to learn very carefully on as we go.    Host: Yeah, and that kind of blends in nicely to this last topic, which is hostile enclosed environments.  Now you're talking about if you're going out for an EVA, now you're right.  You don't have the; you have to sure watch out for any micro meteoroid impacts or anything, but now you're talking about sharp regolith that you have to sort of deal with.    Mike Barratt: Well, you're talking about that, and frankly, I think your tools may be your biggest enemy.  Because you're going to be carrying tools to sample, or to construct, or to move, to repair, to build.  And that will add a whole new dimension to what we're doing.  Now, some of it will be easier just because you'll be able to keep track of everything.  Not everything has to be tethered.  And if you put a tool down somewhere in a safe place, it will stay there, and it will stay safe until you pick it up.  However, it will add the added risks of potentially falling.  Cycling your suit against a surface wear.  So, your boots and whatnot.  And one of the biggest factors that we'll have to deal with is dust; lunar dust.  And lunar dust is an amazing thing because even in our short-duration experience in the Apollo program, it was a big problem.  And I think it will be a bit problem for us as well.  Medically, probably the biggest hazard is how much that's going to interfere with ecosystem valves, fans, anything moving, anything that requires precision fits, which is about everything in spaceflight could potentially be a problem.   And then, airborne lunar dust with the low gravity and the electrostatically charged nature of this dust.  It floats and flies.  And we've done some early toxicity studies.  We don't really know the combination of the factors of lunar dust, toxicity itself, and 1/6th G and how that effects pulmonary ventilation and how those particles might distribute in the lung.  And so, we're now in kind of a new occupational medicine scenario, very similar to silica and coal dust in mines, were we're going to have be very careful about monitoring the effects of dust on lung function.    Host: Right and that kind of goes along with this other part of this topic, which is the closed environment part.  Humans are very picky compared to rovers that we've sent to Mars and to the moon, to really check out that environment, you really don't need life support systems, now you need to deal with the closed environment systems that provide pressure and oxygen.  And you need water.  You need food.  And you need to bring in all with you.  So, that's, I mean, that's got to be one of the; probably the toughest things is that whole human element of exploring.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, well the good news is that generic to almost every space exploration venue we think about.  So, we do need to develop that.  There's no question.  Now, the moon is a good practicing ground for Mars, because there's certain aspects that make the moon harder for long-term habitation.  There's less gravity, only 1/6 instead of a little over 1/3.  There's no atmosphere whatsoever.  Mars is very thin, but it actually does provide some protection from both charged particles and ultraviolet.  And boy, there's a lot of potential learning that will happen on the moon, that if we crack and solve will make things better.  We also, there may be water ice on the moon, which would be really great.  But we know there's water in abundance on Mars.  If we learn to use what small amounts we find on the moon, it will definitely make us better for in situ resource utilization on Mars.    Host: That's right.  Actually, living off the land.  Using your surroundings to.    Mike Barratt: The best we can.    Host: Exactly.  Now, I think one of the more interesting things is the fact that now if you have a human presence on Mars and let's say you have all your equipment, this is sort of I guess part of this topic being the hostile environment.  But it's a new environment.  Sure, you could map your surroundings, but ultimately if you're taking the steps towards this environment, this previously maybe mapped environment.  It is going to be new and you don't really know what you're going to find.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, absolutely right.  What I would like to say though is there is a combination for methods for learning that prep you for exploration.  One of those is what we're doing now.  As much as we can, research ahead of time.  But on the other hand, you can't wait until you know everything to go, otherwise you'll never go.  And you have to have a mindset of learn as you go.  And that has to be baked into your exploration.  So that when you're sending people up there, you know there's going to be some uncertainties.  What are the effects of 1/6th g, I mentioned the dust particles and what those are going to do to us.  So, you have to have a medical monitoring program baked into your exploration, so that you can find and collect these facts as you need to.  Now, all of us need to be naturalist with notebooks when we go explore.  And that includes dealing with medical problems as well.  Now, you don't want an obtrusive medical monitoring program.  You know, we're not going to make this a huge science program to start with.  But it's something they did quite magnificently I would say during the Apollo era.  That learn as you go mindset.   That basically gave results based on medical monitoring we did with all the crew members.  and as a result, we knew a lot coming out of Apollo, to a certain extent because of dedicated science, but to a large extent because of a very logical well applied medical monitoring program.  And that is something we'll absolutely need for going back to the lunar surface.    Host: Yeah, now in terms of the lunar surface, now jumping ahead to Mars, a closed environment.  Sure, you know what's nice about the moon I guess is that it's relatively close.  Not as close as the International Space Station but going back to this whole distance thing.  Mars is pretty far, which means not only do your closed environment systems have to work, they have to work reliably.  Because they have to work for years really.  But, so, how do you make sure that a system can be reliable enough to carry a human for that long?    Mike Barratt: Right.  Well, the operative phrase is reliable enough.  And that means reliable enough to take the risk and just go do it.  And try it.  And the way you make sure is to test everything and field test it as much as possible.  So that you're not putting a cutting-edge system out there that doesn't have years of space miles on it.  That's what you really need.  And that's one thing that the International Space Station is helping us with tremendously.  It becomes in a way, I like to think of it as a low Earth orbit wind tunnel.  Where you can take systems and really test them and shake them out.  And leave them there for crews to use and abuse for months to years at a time and prove that field history.  You know, we're pretty good at developing new systems, and putting cutting-edge technology together into a logical package.  But there's always stuff you don't know.  And you will only find that out when you start using it over time.  And that is exactly what we need to do before we send a system to Mars.    Host: I think that's a perfect place to end it.  It's just the fact that all of this, I mean eventually, you know, journeys to explore the moon on long-duration missions and to Mars to eventually put human boots on Mars.  There are hazards.  And the hazards we sort of list.  But ultimately, once we go and we learn.  I mean that's how you do it.  That's how you do it.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, absolutely right.  I think there's a lot of sentiment that we need to wait until we have everything done, everything together, everything figured out to keep crews healthy and happy on their way to Mars.  But if you look at the exploration archives of our civilization, healthy and happy were not big parts of long sea voyages, or Arctic voyages, or anything where information was found, new discoveries were made of value to us.  And so, we don't expect that on our first exploration sorties.  And we don't want to wait for that.  Healthy and happy is for the paying passengers that come maybe a generation afterwards once we have a settlement and a colony there.  But the we want to get to a point where it's reliable enough to take the risk and the crew is autonomous enough to handle most of those emergencies.  And just realize that nothing is certain, but the benefits and the potential discoveries make it worth the while.    Host: That was great.  Mike, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today, and sharing your story, and really going through these hazards, especially from your perspective as a space traveler yourself.  Really appreciate your time.    Mike Barratt: My pleasure.     [ Music ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So, today we talked with Dr. Mike Barratt about his story traveling to the International Space Station and also his view of the five hazards of human spaceflight.  That's radiation, isolation and confinement, distance from Earth, altered gravity, and then hostile and closed environments.  So, this was sort of a prelude because coming up soon we're going to actually have episodes that dive deep into these five hazards.  Each of them.  One episode per hazard.  We haven't recorded them, so if you have any questions, please send them in.  Use the hashtag askNASA.  And just the make the note that it's for \"Houston, We Have a Podcast,\" and we'll actually put them into those episodes.  And answer the questions associated with each of those five hazards.  You can also listen to other episodes of \"Houston, We Have a Podcast.\"  We call them episodes just for our sake, but really you don't really have to listen to them in any particular order.  Otherwise, you can check out our NASA podcast, \"Gravity Assist\" and NASA in the Silicon Valley.  You can go to NASA.gov/iss.   That's the International Space Station website to find out what's going on on the International Space Station that helps us to identify these five hazards.  Otherwise you can go to NASA.gov/HRP, and that's the Human Research Program site.  On social media, International Space Station is on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.  Again, use the hashtag NASA.  Really, send in your questions.  And we're going to put them in these episodes.  So, this podcast was recorded on May 7th and May 23rd, 2018.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, Pat Ryan, Lori Abidee [assumed spelling], Brandy Dean, Bill Stafford and Mel Whiting.  Thanks again to Dr. Mike Barratt for coming on the show.  We'll be back next week.",

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 59: Distance.  This is part three of our five-part series on the hazards of human spaceflight.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  On this podcast we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, and astronauts all to let you know the coolest information about what's going on right here at NASA.  So today we consider another hazard of human spaceflight, the distance from Earth, with Dr. Eric Antonson.  Dr. Antonson is currently the element scientist for exploration medical capabilities and the assistant director of human systems risk management at the NASA Johnson Space Center.  He's also an assistant professor of emergency medicine and space medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas -- a lot of medicines.  And clinically he works as an attending emergency physician at Ben Taub General Hospital.  His focus lies on the intersection between medicine and spaceflight.  And he's currently tasked with minimizing the risks associated with isolation during exploration-class missions and the inability to provide appropriate medical care.   But first I wanted to start off one last time with Dr. Mike Barrett, who as a NASA astronaut and former flight surgeon gave his own thoughts on the challenges that are presented when traveling far, far away.    Mike Barrett: Well, I think there's many aspects to that.  One, I have to kind of think about the medical issues that -- we know our crews are going to be healthy when we launch them, and we're going to do our best to keep them healthy during flight with countermeasures and diet and medical monitoring.  But if an acute event happens, somebody, for instance, starts clutching their lower abdomen and peeing out blood, then we think there's a kidney stone, you know, that could definitely happen.    Host: Oh.    Mike Barrett: So in this case, instead of getting a panic call to the ground, asking immediately to talk to the surgeon, what we may get is a report saying, \"Crew member so and so was clutching their abdomen in very bad pain.  We pulled out the ultrasound, we found a stone.  We think it's passing.  We've given pain meds, and they're resting comfortably.\"  That's the kind of paradigm that we're moving to so that the crew members, again, are able to respond to an event and handle it the best they can and give us reports and ask for advice, so to speak, consultation rather than real-time guidance.  And that, again, is very exploration-oriented.  And if we have a whatever settlement or colony or outpost on Mars, that's the paradigm.  So that begins with the exploration transit.    Host: Yeah, there's a lot of factors that go into that.  Now you're not -- you have to -- you have another base of knowledge that you have to have as a baseline for wherever you go out.  Because instead of calling immediately to the ground, like you said, and getting the aid, the knowledge of the experts on the ground instantly, now you have to know sort of what to deal with.  And then that mentality of not working together, the mentality of doing it yourself and reporting the progress.    Mike Barrett: Which, truth be told, I think even crew members on station right now -- we understand that we're trying hard to produce science, and having more consultation with the ground is really important.  But more crew autonomy is recommended by almost every crew who returns from station, partly to enhance the efficiency and partly for peace of mind.  But it is something that crew members really, I think, naturally want and will move into quite nicely.  I have to think I had a very small combustion event on the Space Station while I was up there, really almost non-consequential, but that piece of hardware on the Russian segment started billowing smoke and overheating.  And, of course, we were able to immediately call to the ground.  And they knew about it immediately because of smoke detectors and whatnot.  And in this paradigm, it would have been a call back that maybe they would have found out between 8 and 22 minutes later that we had this little combustion event, we pulled circuit breakers, this is what we found.  Everything is fine now.  We replaced the part that was burning, and we are in normal ops recovery.   How was your day?  So, again, that's kind of the paradigm that we'll get to with exploration.    Host: Thanks to Dr. Barrett for providing such great insight over these past few episodes.  So with no further delay, let's jump right ahead to our talk about the hazard of distance with Dr. Eric Antonson.  Enjoy.     [ Music ]    Host: Eric, thanks for joining me here today to talk about the distance from Earth.    Eric Antonson: I appreciate you having me on.    Host: And this is -- this is an interesting topic because it seems so obvious, right?  Of course we're going to be far away, but with that comes a series of very challenging things that we're going to have to overcome to be successful.  So from a broad perspective, if you were -- if someone were to ask you, \"Well, why is distance such a problem?\"  how would you start?    Eric Antonson: It has to do with understanding the implications of what distance from Earth means.  We have grown up in the space age sort of operating in a relatively close position to Earth for the entirety of our program.  And the -- we've had nine missions that have gone outside of low-earth orbit with humans on them.  Those nine missions, the last time that happened was in 1972, right?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: So there's a question of sort of the corporate memory of how to do that.  But there's also a difference in scale and time for the missions that we're talking about.  Those missions were like camping trips.     [ Laughter ]  We -- we spent most of our time learning the skills that we needed to learn in low-earth orbit where we had some advantages, right?  And those advantages from the Human Health and Performance side of the world really can be summed up as three things.  One is if something really goes wrong with a crew member, you come back to Earth.  You can evacuate them.  And that's a reasonably quick timeframe.  Another one is that if you need to resupply something -- consumables, medications, food, whatever it is -- that you have a pretty reasonable chance at having a good supply chain for that.  And then the last one is beyond evacuation and consumables, the ability to actually talk, right?  Real-time communications is something that we rely on in the current operational paradigm, and most people don't realize how much we rely on it.  Everything that the crew does is scheduled down to the minute in many cases or at least the five-minute increment.  And if they have a challenge with all the myriad of different things that they're asked to be experts in and do on the Space Station right now, they get to reach back, right?   If there's an anomaly, or something wrong, or they can't quite figure out how to get this screw off, they get to reach back through the radio in real time and ask somebody, \"Hey, why isn't this working?  Can you help me out?\"  Right?  In the context of low-earth orbit, that means that a lot of their -- the information that they have to rely on, the knowledge, the memory, and the ability to process that information is actually displaced from the crew members down to mission control where you have a bunch of people sitting in a room thinking about this, who all have a bunch of people behind them sitting in a room also thinking about this with immediate access to a lot of data that the crew members aren't going to have.  Now, take us out of that paradigm, right?  Take us someplace far enough away from Earth where you have those three things challenged, you end up in a place where with Mars closest approach, you may have a one-minute -- three minutes one-way delay in communication.  And that's just one way, right?   And at its farthest approach you're talking about the speed of light taking 22 and a half minutes one way to get back to Earth.  And so that ability, then, to reach back and talk to somebody and say, \"Hey, what do I do about this thing that broke here?\"  You don't have that real-time feedback anymore.  Right?  And it gets longer and longer and longer the further you go from Earth.  When we're around the moon, you still have reasonably close to real-time communications, and we can probably establish a logistics chain to get medicines, food, and other things that we need reasonably well, right?  The thing that's really impacted there is if somebody has a medical issue or a problem and they need to be evacuated, you're no longer talking about, you know, a few hours to 36 hours down from low-earth orbit to definitive medical care.  Now you're talking about three days, maybe six days, maybe even longer depending on the orbit and the logistics of actually organizing these things.   So all of a sudden, instead of being able to rely on hey, if something bad happens, I can just take this crew member down to Earth and we can deal with it there, now you have to ask the question of how do I figure out in the really limited mass and volume that we have and potentially the limited data telemetry that we have going back and forth between Earth, how do we get enough information and support to our crews so they can make decisions and do just enough to keep somebody alive or stabilize them for that journey that's going to take a much longer time than it did before?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: And at Mars, if you don't have that evacuation capability, you're kind of in trouble, right?  Because the size of the spacecraft and the amount of stuff that we can bring is only getting smaller.    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: Right?  That's one of the big challenges.  We get less volume to put things in.  We get less mass that we get to carry up there.  For medical and human performance things, that can mean everything from the food nutrition that you eat to the medicines that you'd like to use, right?  All of that sort of stuff, you have less room for it.  But maybe even more importantly, the skillsets, right?  How do you know when something's a problem?  And this is what terrestrial medicine struggles with, right?  When you have somebody come to the emergency department, more often than what they're really asking is, \"Hey, I've got this thing,\" either a rash on my skin or a pole sticking out of me or whatever it is, [Laughs] how big of a problem is this, and how dangerous is this, and how fast does it need to be addressed?    Host: The pole's got to be a big one.    Eric Antonson: I would think so.  Some of these are intuitive, but some of them aren't, right?  I mean, think about when you go to the doctor, right?  Something hurts in my belly, and I don't know what to do about it, right?  And it's not going away.    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: And so that could be anything from I got some food poisoning from something I ate to my appendix is getting ready to burst, to my pancreas is inflamed, to my gallbladder is a problem, right?  That's a huge amount of knowledge that physicians and nurses and other healthcare professionals piece together to try to figure out, all right, am I worried about this or am I not?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: And in a setting where you're on the way to Mars, or even around the moon, you know, the decision to actually evacuate somebody or to try to have to intervene on something at the worst can mean loss of human life if we don't plan correctly and at the best might mean screwing up a multibillion-dollar program that we spent a lot of money to put somebody there to do a mission that they no longer can do.    Host: Seems like -- so you're talking about these three things, right?  We're talking about these camping trips that -- talking, resupplying.  And these elements, it seems like I can just sum them up to autonomy is really what it comes down to, elements and -- of autonomy in all of these procedures and the way that we do things.  They're not going to have the help that they have right now on the International Space Station as much.    Eric Antonson: As much is the keyword there, right?  Because it's sort of figuring out what's the appropriate degree of autonomy so that you're not overdesigning a system, you're not trying to do more than you have to do?  But you do enough to make sure that the crew that you put in place has the knowledge, the skills, the abilities, all the things and the resources that they need to deal with the things that are most likely to happen or those things that are most likely to be preventable that, you know, we really should be able to deal with beforehand.  That's a huge amount of things, right?  That's a -- that's everything that could possibly go wrong in the human body is on the list.  And how do you start -- how do you start whittling that down?  [Laughs] I mean, that's a really big challenge.    Host: Yeah.  So if you're talking about a crew going to -- let's just say as part of the crew of a moon habitat -- or let's just say a Mars has been to the in this instance, I'm guessing you would probably want to vouch for a medical person, a medical expert as part of that crew.    Eric Antonson: So right now in the standards that NASA has, for anything that's considered a planetary mission, we have a requirement to have a physician-level crew member --    Host: There you go.    Eric Antonson: -- as part of that crew.  But outside of planetary, if you're talking about going to the moon, we don't have that requirement, right?  And -- and that's -- it's a judgment call, right?  Where do you draw that line?  It's hard to say.    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: Right?  We have been successfully flying people on the International Space Station for 18 years now, right?  And there have been a lot of medical issues that you probably haven't heard about.  But there haven't been, like, issues to the level of having to evacuate or having to, you know, consider surgery in-flight or things like that, right?  But that's also in a domain where we have things relatively controlled.  So if you transpose that back to the Apollo missions, right, to the moon, we actually had a very well-known case with Fred Hayes on Apollo 13 --    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: -- when he got sick, right?  If you went to see the movie Apollo 13, you they that -- that that character, that astronaut got very sick on the way back.  And actually, getting a little bit of insight into the story around that is very instructive for how we would think about going back to the moon or how we would think about going further out.  See, most people, when they think about the risks that humans face in spaceflight in long duration and outside the Earth's magnetosphere, they focus on things like radiation.  They focus on exercise, bone loss, all these sort of things.  Sometimes isolation with the behavioral health issues.  But it's really hard to quantify what is likely to be the risk from the medical side of things?  And so we do probabilistic risk analysis, and we look all the what has happened in spaceflight, we look at what has happened to the astronaut corps on the ground, and we build an evidence base that helps us to try to get our heads around what we think is likely to happen, right?  And on Apollo 13, what we saw was a case that's sort of a real-world check for how well we're doing, right?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: So interestingly, he had gotten a urinary tract infection, right?  These are not very common for men on the ground.  And there's an anatomical reason why.  They're much more common in women than men because of the length of the urethra that women have, right?  But in space, we actually find that that difference fall apart.  It changes.  We've have had urinary tract infections -- actually a fair amount in men -- up on the Space Station in the MIR program.  And the reason why is because of what the spacecraft environment actually does to your body.  When you go up in microgravity, all your fluids come up out of your legs, and it turns on your carotid baroreceptors, and it changes the way your kidneys work, and you start peeing out a lot of fluid.  And so you get dehydrated, that's one thing.  And when they go up, they also end up having some neurovestibular challenges as the signals coming from their eyes get decoupled with the signals coming from their semicircular canals in their ears.  So they get space motion sickness or nausea, right?  And so they'll take some medicines for that, which are -- Phenergan is one example of them.   Those medicines can actually cause -- one of the side effects that they cause is urinary retention, which can lead to urinary tract infections, right?  And so there's a few different factors that contribute to hey, why do these people get urinary tract infections in this domain?  And the problem is once they get them, then you have to treat them, right?  Crews, when they get retention, will go in and self-cath, which is not a comfortable things to think about.  But this is actually part of the reality of being in a different environment like this.    Host: Oh.    Eric Antonson: And guess what?  That also potentially can introduce bacteria into the urinary tract, right?    Host: Huh.    Eric Antonson: So when Fred Hayes had his problem, part of the reason why he had the problem was because he kept a condom catheter on too long that was supposed to collect urine.    Host: Oh.    Eric Antonson: Right?  A simple thing that could have been avoided.  But then what happened is he got sicker.  So as urinary tracts progress, most of the time we think of a UTI in terrestrial parlance as something you give a few pieces of antibiotics a couple of days and all of a sudden you're better, right?  But in men it's not always that simple.  So we try to figure out well, how bad is the infection, right?  So for Fred, we had a heart rate monitor, and an increasing heart rate is one signal or one thing that we look at to say are they getting sicker or not getting sicker?  And he was getting sicker.  We had a thermometer, but it was broken.  So we actually couldn't tell if he had a fever or not.  We had two different antibiotics that were on the spacecraft at the time, but when we cultured his urine when he got back, we actually found out that those antibiotics wouldn't have worked, that the bug was resistant.  It was a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain that was resistant to the antibiotics.  So if we would have tried to treat him with those antibiotics, they wouldn't have helped, right?  So what happens, then, is the urinary tract ascends and can get to the kidney and can cause sepsis.   And this is one of those things that is now you've got a very big problem that, if you were able to deal with it in the beginning when it was a small problem and keep it from becoming a big problem, you would have been much better off.  So we were lucky with Fred in one sense, even though his spacecraft blew up and he, you know, nearly lost his life because of the problems with Apollo 13.  He actually was lucky that he was already being evacuated back home.  So once they got home, they were able to treat him with the full armamentarium of resources that they have at any hospital, right, and fix him.  Transplant that to a crew that's got three more months left to get to Mars, no ability to evacuate, you can't actually put any new medicines on there if the ones that you have don't work.  If you had broken your thermometer, you wouldn't even have insight into how bad he's getting, right?  So what we learned from that -- and when we do our modeling sepsis and urinary sepsis is one of those conditions that we worry the most about -- what we learn from that is we need to figure out how to plan medical and Human Health and Performance resources to try to deal with the things that are most likely to happen when they're small problems, not when they're big problems.    Host: So when this happened, you did the analysis and realized that the antibiotics that we had onboard wouldn't have helped anyway.  That begs the question well, which ones do you bring on board?  How do you know what's going to happen to a crew and what things you're going to have to treat?  And that's got to be a huge challenge.  Because finite resources is one thing.  And like you said, if you want to go home, it's going to be months until you actually can -- if you don't have the antibiotic at hand, it's going to be months.    Eric Antonson: Yeah, this is a big challenge.  And one of the things that we do, it's actually a very unique capability at NASA in the Human Health and Performance Directorate is we merged an engineering technique called probabilistic risk assessment with medical evidence-based medical needs.  And so there's a team called the integrated medical model that works on hey, let's take all the instances and all the things that we know that have happened in human spacecraft as much as we can and we'll put that into a database, right?  And then we're going to go and look at analog populations, like submariners and people who live in Antarctica, and see what happens with them.  And maybe it's not the same thing as spaceflight, but it's a close approximation.  Then we're going to go look out at the terrestrial literature and see for the things that we know that have happened in spaceflight or things that have happened to our astronauts on the ground, let's see how often those things happen, right?  And you start building up an evidence base that allows you to get an incidence; how often do things occur?  Right?  And how often do they occur in our domain or in domains that are like that, right?  And then you can start actually bring statistical tools to bear to start saying, all right, let's look at what is most likely to happen, let's start looking what the consequences of those things are, what capabilities we would need to deal with those things, what medications we would like to have.   And then you start building up massive databases of this information and process that -- all that data.  And you actually run Monte Carlo models to predict well, how many times is this likely to happen based on what we know from the past, right?    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: That gets you in the ballpark.     [ Laughter ]    Host: All that for a ballpark.    Eric Antonson: It's a huge amount of work just to get in a ballpark.  But it's an evidence-based ballpark.    Host: Yes.    Eric Antonson: It's not a single flight surgeon or somebody else sitting there saying, \"Well, you know, I saw this one guy who had a urinary tract infection, so we should take this medicine instead of that one,\" right?  And this is the challenge of -- of a growing and learning space program, right?  Sixty years ago we were not even necessarily trying to collect a ton of data because we didn't know what was going to be important, what wasn't.  It was just the challenge of getting there.    Host: Right, doing it and then figuring it out.    Eric Antonson: Right?  A huge the amount of risk really up in until today has been borne by the launch vehicle, the landing, right, Challenger, Columbia.  And a huge amount of risk has not been the failure of the human system within those things, right?  But as we go to this greater distance from Earth and longer missions because of that greater distance, that proportion of risk that we carry that is the human system likely to fail gets bigger and bigger and bigger.  And the launch and the landing at the beginning and end of that mission makes up a smaller and smaller proportion of the total risk you carry.  So part of what we're doing with the ISS and other programs that we work on is to try to build up our understanding of how's that human system likely to fail?  What are the things that are most concerning that we need to deal with?  And it's not just medicine, right?  This is behavioral health.  When you put people into isolated chambers as a team for multiple years -- if you remember the Biosphere II project, right, they had eight people for two years stuck in that container, and they ended up all hating each other [Laughs], which is not the team dynamics you really want to have when you're trying to do one of the most challenging things that our species has ever done.    Host: Absolutely.    Eric Antonson: So a lot of research that we do within this domain is to try to make sure that in the isolation and confinement that happens for this small tin can that we're sending, you know, across the solar system, that we have an understanding of the ways in which people are going to suffer the stress, potential depression, challenges in social dynamics.  And this is all behavioral health research that goes on at NASA, trying to inform those.  In addition to that, that distance from Earth sort of hazard also crosses a line when we leave the magnetosphere and all of a sudden we have more and more radiation to worry about, right?    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: This is the one that everybody thinks of as a giant risk.  And it's a big risk, but it's in addition to all these other things that we're talking about.  So all the different things that could go wrong start stacking up.  And we spend a lot of time and effort trying to figure out, okay, how do we prioritize these things?  How do we figure out what are the stuff that we really need to deal with?  And how do we design systems so they are intuitive, so they help the crew with more autonomy, so they actually augment the crew?  We're not looking to replace the crew with an IBM Watson or something that's like artificial intelligence.    Host: Sure.    Eric Antonson: I think a lot of times people think that well, we could put Watson on this spacecraft and it might be able to replace the doctor.  We don't see that being something realistic anytime in the near future.    Host: Humans are too good?    Eric Antonson: Humans are too good.  And part of the purpose of human spaceflight is for us to explore and to -- and to utilize those skills that humans have.  We've already sent robots all over the space -- all over the solar system, right?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: This is the next wave.  This is what happens when we try to go there and try to figure out how we do things, and how we function, and how we respond to this environment.    Host: That's always the feedback I get.  Because that's a question that I love asking all my guests, really, is why do humans have to explore?  And it's that -- I mean, you just can't replace the perspective that you get from sending someone to another planet, or destination, or out in the universe in some thing.    Eric Antonson: I think it's actually more fundamental than that.    Host: Really?    Eric Antonson: I don't know that it's you can't replace it because you can't right now -- maybe someday in the future you could -- bit it's really that you wouldn't want to.     [ Laughter ]  It's a prior assumption, right?  We're going there to learn not only about these places but also about ourselves, about our place in the universe, about how we respond and change.  And we're learning these things on the Space Station right now.  When you talk about the things that happen in astronauts' brains and their eyes and how they're learning to accommodate to long-duration spaceflight what we're really talking about is learning about us in a different environment and what happens, how do we do it?  This -- this group of astronauts that exists in this closed container, we've selected them to be really healthy people, right?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: So if I'm thinking about clinical research and medicine and I want to ask a question about, you know, what happens if I have this one insult on a healthy person, right, these guys are a control group for an experiment that we as a species are doing, trying to understand how we learn about ourselves.  So when we talk about loss of bone, loss of muscle, these are analogs for other diseases and things that can help us inform how we think about those diseases in terrestrial populations in ways that we'd never be able to do on the Earth.    Host: Now, this kind of leads nicely to -- I'm going to kind of combine that with some of the previous statements you made about, you know, we're talking about the supplies and your thoughts about what do we need to collect, what sort -- you know, thinking antibiotics and medicines and supplies?  But then also fitting that with a crew that's going to work well together.  If you're thinking about going to a destination farther away, now you're talking about, I guess, less and less space -- livable space to do that.  You know, we'll have a transit vehicle that's going to go out, and then we're going to have a habitat, but those things -- we're really constrained by the mass that we can bring and the space that's going to be available.  And if you're talking, you know, this group of eight people that hate each other after two years, you know, missions to Mars, they can be longer than that.  So how do you know -- how do you know what to bring and the masses that you -- based on what you think, this is the medical supplies that we can bring that is going to sustain these people?  But then also the people themselves, thinking about those things?    Eric Antonson: You're really talking about the merger of the science that we do, which is building up an evidence base and an understanding that we can draw from strong conclusions about what's important and what's not, what the size of effects are, and the relative proportion of things that are likely to happen, and the merger with engineering kind of in a systems engineering type of world, right?  When you build a spacecraft, right, you have a whole bunch of different subsystems for that spacecraft that you got to accommodate.  You have the structures to hold it all together; you have the propulsion system to push it all around; you have the power system to make sure that you can turn the lights on, turn the lights off, do whatever you need to do.  Those are all sort of well understood piece parts of a vehicle.  And then you also have this human system, right?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: Which is the people, yes, but then all the things you need to keep the people alive, like the food, and the consumables, and the things that you're talking about.  And then also along with that, the monitoring and the tools that you need to understand the environment that they're living in; is this staying within the parameters we like?  The people themselves, are they staying within the parameters that we like?  That's where heart rate, and temperature, and some fundamental vital signs, and things like that are really important to know, right?  And so it's this gigantic smorgasbord of a lot of information that has to be put together in a systematic approach, right?  And that's why this is such a fascinating both scientific and engineering problem, right?  We are trying to do something that's never been done before in the history of our species.  When I show slides that have, like, the solar system with the sun in the middle and the Earth and then Mars and their relative positions, and I talk about hey, the distance here, the distance that we're going just to get to Mars, one of the things that I say is, \"You see that little blue dot that is representing Earth?   At this scale on the solar system, our entire species, everything we've ever known is still within the size of that dot, even the visits to the moon are still within the size of that dot.\"  When I put it up with the Mars orbital distances, right?    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: Like, this has to have and has to involve the most rigorous, systematic, and disciplined approaches to both, you know, no kidding understanding what is happening to the human body in this domain and how it changes -- the mind, the behavioral health issues, our response to the radiation environment, galactic cosmic rays, potential solar particle events, our likelihood of medical conditions occurring.  You know, the risk that we buy down from selecting the healthiest people in the world has been great for low-earth orbit, but you get diminishing returns when you get out to three years.  These people are not superhuman.    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: They're still human, right?  And so what you're really talking about when you say, \"How do we approach this problem?\"  well, some of that probabilistic risk analysis and modeling is part of it, but we're still building the tools for a lot of these things.  We're still building models, we're still building experiments.  The Human Research Program is still trying to make sure that they make investments in places where they get results that inform positively do we care about this, is it really important, or should we move on to the next problem?  Because we got a long line of problems that we have to challenge, right?    Host: Yeah.  And you kind of alluded to this before -- and this is -- I'm going to bounce into a topic, you know, thinking about we have so many questions that we need to answer, but we are investigating things right now.  So let's go into that.  You know, what do we know?  What do we know right?  And there's been instances like you said before -- you kind of hinted at this in beginning -- there's been, you know, medical things happening you said on MIR.  What were some of the things that were happening?  And then what did we do to resolve them real-time?    Eric Antonson: Yeah.  So there's -- there's a variety of different things.  And this actually feeds how well we validate some of the modeling that we do to try to predict the future.  Right?  You remember that there was one episode where there was a fire on MIR.  And one of the medical issues that comes out of that is smoke inhalation.  All of a sudden you got people inhaling smoke -- maybe haven't gotten to their mask in time or things like that.  And now you have this exposure potentially toxic exposure that's also causing them to cough and to, you know, not be able to function.  And you have to make a decision about hey, do we actually, like, get out of here, right?  Even if you contain the fire, if you've got a crew member who is incapacitated because of the results of that fire because of burns or because of smoke inhalation or something like that or, you know, maybe that fire damaged something like the ammonia lines and all of a sudden off toxic exposure, right, you have to try decide what do we do about that in real time?  There were -- there was at least one case of a cosmonaut who had a cardiac dysrhythmia who was disorbited from it.  And -- and we've seen changes in heart rhythm as we've gone through the space program.   There have been astronauts that had atrial fibrillation.  The question mark is, like, is this something that, you know, we need to not have somebody fly for?  Or all of a sudden, you know, they never had this problem, and you get into spaceflight and maybe they have it there.  We actually haven't seen any of that in the American cohort, but there was one Russian who was deorbited for it.  And then there's that question of, like, if you follow that to its logical conclusion, all right, that sort of explains why we do the biological monitoring that we do -- heart rate, that sort of stuff.  You see in Apollo 13 and other movies they have these pads on and you got a signal sending down to the ground.  Sometimes your problem is you may actually have too much information and information that you don't know what to do with.  So a lot of what we continue to learn as we go forward is do we really want to know this?  Right?  And what I mean by that is something we find things in clinical medicine on the ground that we call incidentalomas, right?  You go and you scan somebody's head because they -- you know, they got in a car accident and you're worried about it.  And you don't find any evidence of trauma, but you find something there that you're not sure what to do with that wasn't bothering them before.   Now that can set off a chain of events.  Do we have to go look at that further?  Do we have more specialists involved?  Does somebody get poked and prodded?  Do we start causing more problems than we solve because we saw this thing that we don't know what the significance is?  And that happens in terrestrial medicine all the time.    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: Now transplant that to the spaceflight environment where something happened.  We measured something, we don't know if this is a big problem or not.  Are we going to do more harm than good to a crew member or to a team by chasing after it, or should we wait and see?  Right?  That's a challenge.  This is in the clinical world.  In my job in emergency medicine I run into this a lot, right?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: What's the appropriate amount of concern that I should have for somebody who's really healthy, highly functioning, not having any problems?  And then there's this thing, a CT scan or an ultrasound that was found, right?    Host: Yeah.  And it sound like a judgment call based on the physician on the ground.  But the problem is now you're not getting as much data as we go further away, correct?    Eric Antonson: And so you now find that line, which is where the science and the art of doing these things meets, right?  I mean, in clinical medicine today, right, we don't know everything.  There's still lots -- huge -- amounts of clinical trials going on that inform us and update us on what the best things to do are for our patients.  It's no different in spaceflight.  As we go longer and learn more, we incorporate the corporate memory that we've had from the past and the things that we're learning there to update what we're doing.  But at some point you're operating in a domain where you don't have a huge amount of evidence to influence what you do.  And this is where flight surgeons and operational support have to make judgment calls.  And that is that line between science and art of how you actually do these things.  And that's the beautiful thing about this job is that you live in that domain where we're constantly pushing the boundaries of what we know and how we understand it in the larger system of what we're doing.  And you get to build the science to help inform the art.    Host: So I'm guess we have a lot of -- a lot of practice with the International Space Station now?    Eric Antonson: So you've got 18 years of people being up there.    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: That -- it's interesting.  When people bring up, \"Hey I have this concern,\" right?  Radiation is going to turn bacteria into these horrible, mutant, virulent beasts, and people are going to get sicker than they've ever gotten before.  And then you look at the Space Station, and yeah, we swab the surfaces and we measure this stuff.  And we have scientists here look at samples and all that sort of stuff.  And yeah, there's some stuff growing up there that, you know, you don't want to hear about.  But at the same time in 18 years, you've never really had somebody get sick from those particular bacteria or those things growing.  You're not having this epidemic of astronauts, you know, all of a sudden, you know, ending up incapacitated because there's some fungus or some mold growing in the corner, right?  And so it's that -- that's part of what informs the judgment, right, is hey, how do square the science and the things that we're learning about the way genetics, and bacteria, and viruses get modified in this new environment, and our own body's immune systems changes, and our T-cells drop over time when we're in microgravity and low-earth orbit?   And what are the consequences of that?  And then you look up at the clinical level and you say, \"Well, nobody's really getting that sick, so how much do I have to care?\"  That's great, six months.  We've got a pretty good establishment of that.    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: I'm not too worried about it.  Three years with all three of those things that we were talking about earlier no longer being available.  How comfortable do we feel extending that sort of experience-based judgment calls and the art side of this out into that domain?  And that's what helps us guide where we put our research investments in the science is to help inform that for these longer, and longer, and longer duration things that we're looking to do.    Host: Which is a lot of what we're doing on the Space Station is learning what we learn here, we get to kind of package and then take out.  Obviously there's going to be things we're going to have to learn along the way.  But it's a pretty good model, especially operationally whenever we're doing things day-to-day.  I did want to circle back, though, to you said there's stuff growing on the Space Station, you know, all the time.  But 18 years, not really a concern.  What's growing, and how come medically we're okay?    Eric Antonson: Well, this is, like, if you think about your house on Earth, right?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: And you can certainly find websites and companies that want to go clean up all the fungus and the mold in your house.  And maybe at some point you get to a point where that stuff actually starts to bother the people in your house or you have people who start having allergic reactions, but, you know, it's really not a different thing than there.  There's fungus, there's bacteria.  There's a variety of bacteria that we bring on our skin everywhere we go.  Right?  And some of these are the most common bacterias that we worry about in terms of infections, right?  Staphylococcus aureus is a naturally occurring colonizing species on your skin -- we all have it.    Host: Eww.    Eric Antonson: I know, I'm sorry.  Staphylococcus, right, when you think about strep throat, these things live on our skin, right?  They don't really actually cause problems for us until they get into someplace where they're not supposed to be, like, for example, if somebody gets a cut and all of a sudden, like, bacteria from the skin is now down in the bloodstream or in the subcutaneous tissue and all of a sudden, you know, maybe you get an infection there.  If you're really healthy, you probably don't.  In terrestrial medicine the places where we see this is people with diabetes and with suppressed immune systems and stuff like that, right?  That's where we really worry about it in terrestrial medicine.  But hey, when we've measured the T-cells in our own immune system in flight, we've seen some changes there.  We see the T-cells decreasing over time in the microgravity environment.  So where is that point at which hey, we're kind of approaching an immune suppressed status and we might need to worry about this more?  In the case of these six-month missions, we haven't reached that point, which makes us feel good, right?  That's -- that's helpful.  But at a year or two years as we stretch that out, do the T-cells keep dropping or do they threshold and plateau someplace?   If think threshold and plateau someplace, maybe it won't be a problem with all the bacteria we brought up.  Maybe our body can handle it because it normally can.  But I don't know if they plateau or if it keeps going down and then you're going to have a problem in two and a half years right at that point you're on your way back from Mars but you still have long enough to go that you could get really sick and not be able to do much about it.  And by the way, all those medicines you brought with you?  If we look at the formulary on the International Space Station right now, about 16% of those medications that are on the International Space Station could within the labeled expiration dates actually make a trip out to Mars and back.    Host: That's good to know.    Eric Antonson: So on the way back, if you still have three months to go, most of your medicines, they may not work if we were just using what we had on the Space Station today.    Host: So what do we do to extend the life?    Eric Antonson: That's a good question [Laughs].  That's one of the areas that when I was working for exploration medical capabilities, we laid out a pharmacy research plan to try to address just that stuff, right?    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: Some medications seem to be affected by the spaceflight environment.  We've left stuff up there for about 880 days and we've seen increased degradation rates in what we call the API's -- the active pharmaceutical ingredients -- compared to stuff that's on the ground, right, controls that we look at.  And it's hard to suss out why.  Maybe some of it's radiation, maybe some of it's the environment, some other things.  But what we're trying to get heads around is are there biochemical categories of medications that make more sense to rely on because other ones break down faster in that environment?  Some things that are happening in the pharmaceutical industry in terms of, you know, adding additives to pharmaceutical makeups can actually extend those expiration dates; can we take advantage of those sort of things?  Do we try to make medicines that instead of having to take twice or three times a day for ten days for your antibiotic course, you take once, right?  NASA doesn't do that stuff, but we look to the pharmaceutical industries and the advances that they take to try and pull intelligently the things that are going to extend our pharmacy and make it more functional over the timeframes we're talking about.    Host: Yeah.  Now, this -- this kind of goes back to you talking about, you know, what happens after six months?  Does it plateau or does the immune functionality continue to decrease?  What knows?  But my assumption would be if it does, if we do have to worry about possibly go -- decreasing -- now maybe you're taking more medication, now maybe you're being extra careful where if you do get a cut, oh, you want to patch that up immediately because you don't want anything getting in.  Now you're talking about using more resources.    Eric Antonson: And having to bring more to be able to enable that.    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: Which we don't have a lot of volume for.    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: It's this -- this ultimate backpack game, right?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: How do you build up the best understanding of what changes are going to happen and being impactful?  So you only bring the things that really matter.  Like, right now we have a defibrillator up on the Space Station, and it's an ongoing source of discussion, right?  You're familiar with the defibrillator like in the airport?  You put it on, you shock somebody's heart if their heart were to stop.    Host: Clear, yeah.    Eric Antonson: Clear, bzzt [Laughs].    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: The whole -- the whole point of that sort of thing is that when the heart enters certain electrical rhythms that don't pump blood, you stun it and reset it, right?  But what you're really talking about, the underlying problem before that and after that is what's wrong with this person that their heart actually entered that?  And most of the things that would lead to that are stuff we screen for and get out of the way in the astronaut corps, right?  So we don't really expect them to be in a position where they're probably going to need that.  The likelihood of it happening is extremely low.  And so if you're really up against the wall in terms of the volume, does it make sense to bring that, right?    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: I don't know because it's a really, really, really low likelihood event, but it's really high consequences if it happens.  But part of the way we answer that is by looking at all right, what else comes with that?  If you actually shock somebody, it doesn't mean they're automatically okay, right?  This is not TV.  [Laughs] It means that you've got a whole bunch of other work to do and a whole bunch of other resources to bring to bear to do resuscitation on somebody who's really sick.  And the odds of us being able to supply those sort of things in this small volume and space is really, really small, right?  So now you start asking the question, \"Is that a risk we're willing to take?\"  And it's a challenge.    Host: Yeah.  Because now you think about oh man, but what if we do need it, right?  But you're saying -- you're pretty confident based on we've flown so many times and we've gotten, you know -- if you're thinking back to Fred Hayes, back to that time, we were kind of figuring out spaceflight.  That was the whole point of Mercury, and Gemini, and Apollo is to keep going further and kind of figure it out along the way.  Now we've done it a lot.  We kind of know what we need to do before a spaceflight to make that spaceflight successful medically too.  So yeah, maybe you can kind of take it away and feel confident learning from these operations.    Eric Antonson: To paraphrase Frank Borman when he was sitting in front of Congress, right, the places that we're going to fail after this much time are the places where we have a failure of imagination, right?  It's the things that we didn't know about that are going to come and bite us.  And there's going to be enough of those.  So we have to intelligently plan for the things that we do know about.  If something is really, really low likelihood, we probably need to be making room for things that are much more high likelihood that will help to us make sure that we don't let those small problems, the little cuts to the skin, the infection in the urine, the other things like that grow into the big problems that all of a sudden we're never going to be able to provide the resources to handle if it reaches something like a sepsis level.    Host: Do you find that, you know, meeting with other doctors and other people in your field, getting together, you're still coming up with more questions that needs to be answered?    Eric Antonson: I would say that all good science lead to more questions.     [ Laughter ]  That's just the reality of the world in which we live, right?  As soon as you start nailing down something in the evidence base, you immediately have the question of wait, but what if this happens or what if our assumptions about this weren't correct?  How does that change what we would do?  And that's an ongoing conversation and question that we have with the flight surgeons, and the research doctors, and the research scientists, and the immunologists, and the toxicologists, and the systems engineers?  Like, this is what the ongoing conversation is that occurs between the people doing a lot of the research in these areas and the people who are doing operations right now for the programs that we have set up.  I mean, SS is the most big and visible of them.    Host: Sure.    Eric Antonson: But there's other things that are happening -- the commercial crew programs and how we interface with those guys, Orion's coming up, and then soon to be Gateway.  Like, these are all going to have unique challenges.  And everybody that's got experience to bring to bear, they have a piece of the puzzle for figuring out how to do it safely and how to do it right.  Right?  And then there's also people who are working in field that we haven't had to pull on yet that are going to have other pieces of the puzzle.  So how to do it safely and how to do it right?    Host: Now I know, I mean, just personally working with large groups, you get a lot of different input and diversity of thought, which is good.  But then you have everyone providing so much input that you can't agree on anything.    Eric Antonson: At some point you got to make a decision [Laughs].  How does that happen?    Host: That was going to be my question.  How do you -- I mean, you do want as much information as possible.  Because that's how you're going to be successful.  But then how do you -- how do you know which things to sacrifice?  You know, you're already talking about a defibrillator.  How do you know which things to sacrifice to come to an agreement on this is the most important elements of what's going to make a mission successful?    Eric Antonson: Yeah, so part of this question is really wrapped in what at NASA or who at NASA makes decisions, right, after they have looked across all this stuff?  So there's a couple of different places.  I work with the Human Health and Performance directorate.  My job right now is assistant director for humans systems risk management.  And one of those parts of that job is to chair the human systems risk board.  I started that a couple months ago, it's actually a new job for me.    Host: Oh, cool.    Eric Antonson: But the purpose of the board is to look across all the risks that we have to try to assess the evidence base to understand, hey, how big of a problem is this, how well do we understand what as going on, how well do we expect to know what's going on in a few years, you know, and how do we prioritize where we should put our investments?  And that board is a wide group of people who look at these problems from a bunch of different angles.  And they come together and no kidding, no everybody goes away happy all the time.  But it's one of those hey, we got to have a transparent and open discussion about what the puts and the takes are when we're looking at these programs and how we're funding our research going to the future.  And so that board actually flows out of the Health and Medical Technical Authority.  There's three technical authorities at NASA that were founded after the Columbia accident.  When they were looking at what were the pressures that teams that were looking at the risks and the challenges and the science of what they were doing -- what pressures were they facing just because the agency had goals and they were sometimes pushing on people to meet them, right?    Host: Sure.    Eric Antonson: So what they did was they established three independent reporting lines.  People who had no dog in the fight for actually getting and meeting program schedules.  One of those is an engineering technical authority.  One of them is a safety and mission assurance one.  And the third one is a Health and Medical Technical Authority.  And it derives its power from the chief medical officer and headquarters at NASA.  But the responsibility of that group is look at the risks, look at the evidence base, look across all of these problems and start prioritizing.  Right?  And start making some of those hard decisions about if we're going to make standards that we hold future programs to and requirements about whether or not you're going to have a defibrillator or something else, right, that those -- those things have an open and vigorous debate about the benefits and the costs potentially, the risks of including this and not including that.    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: And so we're always working to try to improve how much information we bring to bear, how we actually communicate, right?  It's very easy for technical people in these fields to speak with jargon and to potentially leave other experts who are, you know, as accomplished in completely different fields sitting there, thinking, like, they're idiots because I don't understand what this person is saying.    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: So you're talking when we come to these boards, what we're talking about is bringing expertise, and engineering, and spacecraft, and systems engineering together with medical doctors, together with life scientists.  And all of them are speaking their own languages, all right?  It's a big challenge.  So this past year, the former chief medical officer -- guy named Rich Williams from NASA -- actually commissioned a book called the Rosetta Stone.  It's a handbook for trying to get life scientists, fit medical doctors, and engineers to understand each other's perspective and the language they speak in.  Because we're always trying to figure out how do you take people who have a huge amount of insight and understanding in this field over here and get them to understand what the problems are in a different field?  That communication is a massive challenge.    Host: Absolutely.  Oh, I want to check that out, too.  Because that would be probably good across the board just communicating with folks that maybe speak a different language than you.    Eric Antonson: Yeah, we just published that one a couple months ago.    Host: Nice.  Well, focusing on that, now you said you're focusing on human systems risk management, but you also are actively practicing emergency medicine.  So with that comes a certain perspective when it comes to what you bring to the table.  So what are some of the things that you've been bringing to the table recently?    Eric Antonson: So I maintain practice in emergency medicine up at Ben Taub.  I'm professor at Baylor.  And NASA actually buys my services from Baylor as a professor.  The -- my perspective is informed by what do I do in emergency medicine in my practice today?  And maybe even more so, what would I rather have been done so that somebody didn't have to show up in the emergency room, right, the preventative aspect of care?    Host: Captain Hindsight.    Eric Antonson: I get a lot of opportunities to say, \"Man, it would have been great if you would have just done this or known that or, you know, and the system had this sort of thing plugged in.\"    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: And that's part of it.  The other half of my background is I was a PhD engineer, aerospace engineer in propulsion.  I used to do that for the Air Force Research Laboratory.  So I spent a lot of time both as a medical doctor kind of dealing with the realities of the sickest people that we see in Houston -- Ben Taub is a level one trauma center.  It's a lot of indigenous, immigrant, uninsured population that we deal with there.  So people who have not had the primary and preventive care we would like to see, and therefore they end up in emergency rooms more often than not.  And then I also have spent time as an engineer for spaceflight, looking at how propulsion systems mesh with the larger vehicle systems.  And so when I look at the problem of human system risk, I'm looking at it from the what's the right answer on the medical side hopefully to prevent the problems that I see and deal with in my practice?  But how do you make that jive with the realities of the engineering life cycle of designing a vehicle?  Right?  One of the biggest oversights that the physicians have in the flight surgeon cadre who have never been exposed to an engineering design life cycle is they don't even know what the words mean, right?    Host: [Laughs] Goes over my head.    Eric Antonson: These spacecraft, when you're starting to build a spacecraft, right, you have different phases that engineers all understand -- prephase A, phase A, phase B. You don't actually fly one until you get to phase E. And prephase A can start a decade before you actually build this thing.  Right?    Host: Wow.    Eric Antonson: So when you're actually designing and creating the requirements that a Boeing, or the NASA engineers, or SpaceX, or somebody's going to go build this spaceflight do, you kind of need to know what you need to get it into the mix at least five years and sometimes longer ahead of time.    Host: Wow.    Eric Antonson: Now, contrast that with what happens in the medical world in technology development, right?  All of a sudden we have this explosion of innovation in the medical world.  What we're learning and how we use things like iPhones, which didn't exist when I was in grad school, right, or even in medical school, like, the technology that we are able to bring to bear on understanding the human system just for terrestrial medicine right now is changing so rapidly that if I said, \"I want to use this thing in five years for my medical practice,\" I would be doing my patients in five years a severe disservice.    Host: Right [Laughs].    Eric Antonson: Right?    Host: You can't do it.    Eric Antonson: So now think about the Space Station, right?  It's 2018, we've been having people up there since 2000.  The first module went up in 1998.  The design freezes that occurred for what was going to be included on this vehicle in the year 2018 happened probably three to five years before 1998, right?  I got my first cell phone of any kind in 1998 [Laughs], right?  The ways in which we handle data and expect things from our technology are completely different today than they were then, right?  We don't have automatic means of capturing a lot of information up on the Space Station and the things that we do have are fixes we've made after the fact.  So when we talk about designing something like the Gateway vehicle or, like, what's going to take us to Mars and you're trying to figure out what the right things to include are today, knowing that that mission may not happen for five to ten years, but if you don't actually put placeholders and things in there, then the engineers aren't going to actually keep volume and mass for your stuff, right?   And this is the problem.  What we have on the Space Station today in terms of a medical system is good.  We have an environmental health monitoring system.  We have a health maintenance system, which is some medical kits with equipment and supplies and medicines.  And we have a countermeasure system, which involves exercise equipment that we've changed over time, right?  None of the data from any of those things is connected.  Right now if you wanted to know for your, like, fitness how well you're doing on keeping up with your stuff, you'd use your Apple Watch, or your MyFitnessPal on your phone, or something to track your job in the park.  And you could, like, see how you're doing over time, right?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: None of that stuff was designed into the Space Station.  But it's an expectation on the data that we have for today in the world that we operate with that we're at least going to have that sort of interoperability with the things that we send on a crew to Mars.  But remember, NASA's been operating and optimizing a system for the last 18 years that hasn't needed that.  So it's actually a shift, a big shift in the way we think about the way we do business in low-earth orbit.  We have put up some things like apps with iPhones and iPads -- not iPhones but iPads.  And sometimes we've learned things that were surprising.  Like, the certificates for the Apple iPad and the apps that they have, they don't -- since they don't have a direct connection to the Cloud, all of a sudden your iPad's going to stop working after a certain amount of time.    Host: Oh.    Eric Antonson: Yeah.  So now you got to accommodate in the networking that you do for the vehicle.  And we still have problems with it.  We've ran into it for the last several years.  It's those type of small problems that we learn in a systems engineering sense and in a data management sense in the Space Station today that we need to make sure don't happen on the way to Mars.  Right?  So we're learning in every aspect.  It's not just how the human body changes but even how we do data, how we set up our networks, how all this stuff talks to each other.  And when we get into that place where we all of a sudden no longer have any real-time communications and you need to put that ultrasound on somebody and go look at their appendix or their kidney or something, and you don't have somebody to guide you and tell you which way to point the probe, you better have included a learning module that shows them how and where to look and how to interpret the images.    Host: Yeah.  So being conscious of your time, I'm just going to ask you one more thing: If you had to take something -- just based on what we've discussed today -- and let's say we have a long-term presence on the moon, some folks that are practicing some of these things that we need to explore further out into the solar system, Mars being one of the destinations, what are some of the things that you are looking forward to trying on the moon?    Eric Antonson: So there's a giant list.     [ Laughter ]  Part of it is actually managing the data that we have and learning how to do that with a different ground support model than we currently have today.  Because those are the first steps of what's going to enable us to change from the ISS paradigm and the everything readily available paradigm over to something that's going to be appropriate to going to Mars.  That's one way that we learn to do the mix of monitoring the human system that we worry about, along with making sure that we can be supportive in whatever ways we can be.  Another thing is we don't have a dose response curve for gravity and what happens with the human body.  Right?  Those T-cells that I told you about declining?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: I don't know if that's isolation, stress, radiation, microgravity, right?  You put somebody on the moon, all of a sudden you have a data point at one-sixth gravity, right?  We don't know the neurovestibular changes that happen.  We don't know how long they're going to last when you go into one-sixth gravity.  We don't know how well the body's going to accommodate in one-sixth gravity compared to microgravity, right?  Or three-eighths at Mars, right?  So part of spending time on the surface of the moon from the perspective of the human and how we change is starting to get another data point somewhere between no gravity and the three-eighths gravity that we expect on Mars.  And right now all we've got is 1G and zero, right?  So that's a really amazing opportunity to start collecting data in a partial gravity environment and start building that dose response curve to what happens to the whole accommodation, right?  You've heard of the sands problem, sometimes called VIP, where they have the eyeball changes, and some astronauts have had changes in their vision and need to wear glasses and that sort of thing?   How's that going to change when you put partial loading back on the body?  When you actually have the fluids in the body pulled back down again.  But maybe not that much, right?  It's a whole new set point for adaptation that we're not going to understand that until we spend some time there doing it, right?  We didn't have enough chance in the '70s when we were at the moon to really start kind of gauging those questions.    Host: Right, they were camping trips.    Eric Antonson: We've got basic functionality, right?  Can we do this?  Can you walk around?  What happens if you fall over, right?  And also we learned that astronauts would hurt themselves in creative ways [Laughs].  You know, when we do our modeling for the loads that people experience and we're worried about hey, are these guys to break their bones because of the changes in their bone density and stuff like that?  Most of the modeling of loads that we would expect to be applied says no, it's too low of a load in these gravitational fields.  And yet one of the astronauts, you know, managed to go out there, get a piece of equipment stuck in the ground, and then trying to get it out, stuck his shoulder up underneath it and really hurt himself pushing up against it, right?  It's those sort of things that oh, I didn't know that person was going to do that.  I probably should be aware of that and take that into concern or into my calculations for what I provide, right?  [Laughs] It could be anything from, like, potentially fracturing a bone to pulling a muscle, to just having a bruise.  We don't know, but it sort of reminds us that when we think we have solutions and we think we have answers, humans have a wonderful way of surprise us.    Host: Yeah.  It's those extra data points that are really going to be -- really going to help us out.  But then just learning along the way, what questions do we still need to ask?    Eric Antonson: Yeah.  Right now we're comfortable with the evacuation times we have from the Space Station.  What happens when we're living in that domain where it takes three days?  How do we change the way we view medicine?  How do we change the way we view prevention?  How do we change the way that we support our crews as we get farther and farther away from Earth?  As that distance increases, the question marks just multiple.  So that's one more set of data points and ways in which we can start to understand the real impact of that hazard, which is distance from Earth.    Host: I can't wait to find out.    Eric Antonson: Me, too.    Host: Eric, thanks for coming on the podcast today and sharing your perspective on what it takes to go far, far away.    Eric Antonson: I appreciate you having me.  Thank you.     [ Music ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So today we talked with Dr. Eric Antonson.  We talked about being far from Earth, the distance from Earth, and all the challenges that come with it.  This is part of our series of the five hazards of human space flight.  We've had several podcast episodes so far -- two down, I guess this is our third, and two more to go.  We are actually partnering with the Human Research Program to do this series.  So they have a video series and animations that are paired with each of these episodes.  You can go to NASA.gov/hrp to see those videos and the content that's supplemented with these five hazards and the three that we've done so far.  For the International Space Station, you can go to NASA.gov/iss.  A lot of the research we talked about today is on board the International Space Station.  So you can go to that website to find out some of the research going on there.  Otherwise you can follow us on social media.  It's Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for the International Space Station or the NASA Johnson Space Center accounts.  Go to those, whatever platform is your favorite, and use the hashtag #AskNASA to submit an idea for the show.   Just make sure to mention it's for Houston, We Have a Podcast and we might make a whole episode out of it.  So this podcast was recorded on June 28th, 2018.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, Pat Ryan, Bill Stafford, Nell Whiting, Bill Pulaski, Judy Hayes, [inaudible], Mel Whiting, and [inaudible].  Thanks again to Eric Antonson for coming on the show.  We'll be back next week with the fourth of the five hazards of human space flight, discussing altered gravity fields.  See you then.",

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 123, “Humans in Space.” I'm Gary Jordan. I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers and astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. Human spaceflight, we talk about it a lot. But that human element in front is a very important piece of the puzzle. It can make traveling through space a lot more complicated, what with redundant systems, that pesky little thing called life support and that heightened element of risk. But, in the end, a human can lean on curiosity and discovery in space exploration to do so much more, and best of all can share the experience that many of us can only dream of. A lot of work at NASA goes into understanding the human element in human spaceflight. In fact, there's a program right here at the Johnson Space Center that focuses on just that. It's called the Human Research Program. Longtime listeners may recognize this program from many of the episodes we've done in the past, namely, the series on the “Five Hazards of Human Spaceflight”, Episodes 56 through 61, for those interested. But there's a lot more to the program, and it can be organized into different elements or areas of focus. So for these next six episodes, we're going to dive deep into the work being done to understand what exactly happens to the human body in space, because there's so much more work that goes behind that than you might think. Physiology, how humans interact with machines. Human behavior. It involves analogs on the ground or like pretend spaceflight in a sense, like habitats. It also involves other NASA centers, universities and international organizations. And all of this work helps us to be successful in space. It informs us now on the International Space Station and informs us on what we can expect on the Moon for NASA's Artemis Program and for traveling to Mars. And it shows us what we can learn that can be shared and pulled into other areas other than human spaceflight for the benefit of humankind. So here to give us an overview on everything Human Research Program is Dr. Jenn Fogarty. She's the chief scientist of the program, and today she describes the history of human research, the disciplines within the programs and why we're focusing on these particular elements. So here we go, the history and elements of human research at NASA with Dr. Jenn Fogarty. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Jenn Fogarty, thanks so much for coming on the podcast today.  Jennifer Fogarty: Well, thanks for having me. It's a pleasure to be here.  Host: We talk a lot about human spaceflight, and today, we're going to talk about that very first word, human. It's a very big part of it, and there's a lot that goes into it, so we're really going to have you break it down, and I'm excited for you to do that for us.  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah, my pleasure. I mean that's what I do for a living, so I'm always excited to talk about it.  Host: Yeah, you have a long history in human research. Let's go through your biography. Tell me how this all came about for your career.  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah, it was a bit of a winding road. I'm really glad where I ended up, and when I talk to young people today, I kind of give them the perspective that anything is possible, you know. It's taking on challenges and opportunities and keeping your mind open along the way. So, I've always been interested in medicine and human health and how people stay well and how people get sick and how we fix them. That was, my earliest memories as a kid I was never shy of injuries or blood or anything. I was just deep into those things. [Laughter] I had three brothers, so there was plenty of blood and guts and stuff to see. [Laughter]   Host: Oh right.  Jennifer Fogarty: So yeah, it was, that was my passion from, just don't even have a memory of it, just felt very intrinsic. So, always thought any kind of education that expanded on that. So, when it came time to make decisions about college, premed was definitely the track of choice. But then really understanding what premed was and kind of, you know, the reality of finances and how was I going to get there and do all these things. And I was actually first-generation college. My parents were children of immigrants, and so kind of how you face learning how to do these things and accomplish these tasks. So, didn't get a whole lot of guidance, you know, and I think some of this takes a lot of support to overcome these things. A lot of different people manage. But anyway, it's a kind of winding road. So I did biology as undergrad with a minor in chemistry. I did really well in college. I was, really liked being a student, loved to read, so getting grades wasn't hard. But applying it is the key. And then it comes to the decision about graduate school. Where are you going to go, what are you going to do? And when I was struggling a little bit and kind of, you know, each kid is trying to stretch their wings and figure out what to do, I decided, I'm from New Jersey, I decided to leave and kind of came west, all the way to Texas.  Host: Alright. [Laughter]   Jennifer Fogarty: Ended up applying, getting accepted to Texas A&M College of Medicine, but to the PhD program. So I really was fascinated with the research side, how medicine becomes medicine. Like how do we know to do the things we know? How do those things, how do new treatments come about? Where do they come from, and how do we understand the human body? So I spent five years up there working in a Department of Cardiovascular Physiology, Medical Physiology. Completed my degree, and this is really where the turning point was of space. I was aware of it and really understood aerospace medicine because two of my brothers are in the Air Force. My parents worked for the (Federal Aviation Administration) FAA, so I understood like aviation, general aviation and things like that and understood kind of hypoxia and when people went to altitude. That was kind of a common discussion across the dinner table about pulling G’s and what are called G-LOC, which is gravity induced loss of consciousness, so when fighter pilots pull really high G’s. You can't even feel them in your car like when you take a steep turn at a high rate of speed, something pulling you. They can take up to eight G’s, you know, pulling different maneuvers. And they learn how to stress and strain against it, and they wear a protective suit. So, understanding those kinds of stressors on the human and how you survive them. So along the way, I was doing my work in a lab by a gentleman named Dr. [Michael] Delp, and Dr. Delp got funding from NASA for an experiment and was actually on Columbia-107. So my first experience was getting ready, because we had a certain technique we did. It wasn't the same work I did from a study perspective. But the way you prepare these vessels and study the cardiovascular system was something I specialized in and was good at. So, he said do you want to come with me over to Kennedy and work on this program? And I said sure, I'd love to take a couple months and go do that. So, we moved essentially his entire lab over to Kennedy Space Center, and of course, we're prepared for our experiments when the animals returned on 107, but unfortunately, 107 was one of the vehicles that did not return.  Host: Right, the Columbia accident.  Jennifer Fogarty: The Columbia accident. So, I spent a couple of months out there, because one of the things that happens was they lead sealed the doors for all the labs, so all the equipment was locked in. So a bunch of people had to go back to Texas A&M and kind of resume their lives. But because I was in a postdoc position, I had some latitude. So I stayed there and just started reading and learning more about NASA and kind of maybe there was a place for me there. So I started looking for jobs, and about six months later I applied and got a job with a local contractor. At the time it was Wyle, now it's KBR Life Sciences. And started working in medical risk management on the cardiovascular side supporting space medicine. So, that was kind of my entre into NASA.  Host: What a career path. You were already at NASA when you were thinking huh, maybe I should pursue something. You were doing research at the Cape, right?  Jennifer Fogarty: Well yeah. And for me, it was, you know, maybe knowing how NASA kind of has work at different centers at that point, becoming familiar because the grant came from a program that was out of Ames Research Center. I thought well maybe that's where, you know, my skillset would work best. But one of the opportunities came up, and clearly I was only two and a half hours up the road at Texas A&M that I came down and interviewed and luckily enough got to work at Johnson Space Center, which is the manned spaceflight center. And my work that I did for my dissertation was very human relevant. It was on cardiovascular disease and people and how to get past those blockages in your arteries and build new vessels. So, I had a lot of background in doing medically applicable research. And that really was beneficial to space medicine at the time. So I worked with the flight surgeons and with the Chief Medical Officer on kind of selection standards and kind of when medical risks came up and people were being treated, what did that mean to the mission profile? So I spent about 12 years working in the medical side of operations and also worked for what's called the Health and Medical Technical Authority.  Host: So, with your background in how the cardiovascular system works in the human body, what was particularly interesting? What questions were you looking into when you were just starting to get into this world of human spaceflight?  Jennifer Fogarty: Well the one where I kind of, my skillset really played into was a thing called orthostatic intolerance. So it was happening, you know, when crew members return, this goes all the way back actually to Apollo, not quite Mercury and Gemini, and we try to understand why those, why that is true? But the longer you spend in space, your body does a really good job at adapting to it, right. And it's not, and I'll probably expand upon this again more later, because it's super interesting and I think is a little bit of a different take than what people have heard before about spaceflight. But this adaptation is not only perfectly normal but perfectly appropriate. Where it creates a challenge is when you want to change environments very quickly. So when you want to go from microgravity and being in space to coming back to Earth on the order of hours after being in one of those domains for a long period of time, your body is going to have to do another adaptation. And sometimes the amount of time it takes you to adjust is what makes understanding what does the vehicle have to provide the person? What is the person capable of? That space where we have to do research to be able to describe how do you keep that person safe and healthy while their body is readapting. So, again, kind of Apollo, Skylab, definitely during shuttle is where we saw a lot of examples. When people come back to Earth after being in space for a while, and then they go to stand up, there's a couple of things going on. Definitely your neurovestibular system, that organ in the middle ear makes you a little dizzy, so you got to learn where up is again and understand what gravity is to you. But the other thing is your blood vessels actually decided to maybe not do their job the same way in your lower body, and that blood that should be coming up to your head and heart and your lungs kind of sinks down to your lower body and fills your legs. And it's really hard to get it pumped back up. So it causes this thing called orthostatic intolerance where it, when you stand up, your heart rate will get really high. Your blood pressure starts to drop. And eventually, if unsupported or if you don't do something about it, you pass out. Yeah. So.  Host: The same thing happens to me in the gym when I try to do squats.  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah, exactly, and for the same reason. You are collecting a bunch of blood in your lower body where you have a bunch of big muscles, and it's no longer accessible to the upper part of your body. So that's why when you stand up out of a squat, like your eyes, you kind of get that tunnel vision, and you know like oh, if I don't do something, I'm going down. [Laughter] So you need to start walking. It's called a muscle pump. So you use your own muscles to push against your blood vessels to push that blood back up to your heart, which gets it to your head, your brain. So it's the way your body's actually designed to manage the fact that if you're not getting good blood flow to your brain when you're upright, your body lays itself horizontal where there's no gradient, where your heart doesn't have to work very hard to get it from one side to the other because it's all in the same plane. The issue is why it's happening? So, what you're describing with a squat is pretty normal, and you know to move. The other thing is dehydration could be factored into it if you're working out really hard. You need more volume. You need more plasma volume. You need to get water into your system and into your blood supply. But really, it's about sequestering that blood, hiding it more or less in your muscles. And sometimes it actually goes out of the muscles and the blood vessels into the tissue, and that's called third spacing. And the only way to get that, you can't get that volume back into your blood supply. That comes out through what's called your lymphatics. And it'll be made into urine and it's kind of lost. So, when crew members came back and they discovered that a couple of them they were, again, you're measuring blood pressure. You're measuring heart rate. You see these signs tell you that the orthostatic, you know, they're not going to do well on their own, right. Or they need a garment, as I mentioned before with the high-performance jet pilots, an external force. So instead of you walking, like if you don't have the ability to, because it might be a small volume or you don't have any place to walk to, if your muscles can't contract, this suit presses on you. So G-suits fill up. They're usually air bladders, and you can crank up the pressure using a dial to say how much millimeters of mercury pressure do I want to apply to those muscles which also applies to the blood vessels to keep that column of blood going up to your head and heart. So, we actually have used G-suits on the crew members since the Apollo era, because it was a well-known Air Force solution to having a hydrostatic gradient that was pulling blood away from the head and the heart. The issue is that it's meant really for you not to be walking around. They're not usually designed to be ambulatory. They're meant to be seated, which is what a pilot is. So we've had trouble translating them to something that really works for walking. Now the Russians have a solution which is called the Kentavr, and it's a very practical solution. So you have fabric that has lacing down the side. And you can imagine they're like a pair of bike shorts that come up along your hips up to your waist. And then there's also a segment that's on your calves. And you can customize the tightness by how tight you lace them. So it's just a real practical solution.  Host: Squeezing the fluids upwards.  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah, so it's going to keep that column of blood, it won't allow it to expand. It's really hard to tie them tight enough that you get active contraction. But it's just not going to allow it to come out more. So it's an external support, like a girdle type effect. And it's been very successful. And we actually, our crew members use them when we fly on the Soyuz capsule. And we've done experiments with them to understand could we quantify how well they work? The nicest part about them is that they are customizable at the time you wear them. One of the changes that happens in crew members is it's called chicken leg. So when they go into orbit, their lower body does get smaller. They have a little bit of muscle atrophy, but they actually just lose a lot of blood volume out of their lower body. So, if you were only to measure and fit somebody for a G-suit before they left, it would be the wrong size when they returned. It would be too loose.  Host: Wow, there's that much change.  Jennifer Fogarty: There's that much change. It returns to like preflight within a week or so, but that doesn't help you on landing.  Host: Yeah, you need it when you need it.  Jennifer Fogarty: You need it when you need it.  Host: What I'm hearing, what your describing, you know, when it comes to what's happening to the human body in space is these extreme environments put a lot of stress on the human body. The human body adapts, but there's a lot of changes. And so a lot of work at NASA and other places, when it comes to human spaceflight is developing technologies to maybe help mitigate some of these issues, and that may be just one example. But really, it's trying to identify what exactly is happening. And it seems like we're still looking into that.  Jennifer Fogarty: That's right, it's been an endeavor to characterize, because the other complexity is people respond so differently, right. When you think about the uniqueness of each individual, what state, how they start, how much change occurs, in what direction, in what system, so when you talk about the musculoskeletal system, talk about the cardiovascular system, talk about the central nervous system, talk about the GI system. So I talk a lot of times when I do give lectures, I call them dials. Like if you can imagine each one of those systems being a dial across, you know, a table where you've got to control them. Or you watch them change. Then you'd say, OK, in what combination do I turn some of these dials so that that person has the best outcome. Like all those dials add up or potentially multiply together to equal the sum of its parts. And the whole is actually, as stated, typically greater than the sum of its parts, right. You can just try to measure each one very isolated and think you can add them up and get the answer and guess what, biology fools you every time. [Laughter]   Host: Wouldn't it be nice if there was one solution to fit all, but that's not the way humans work.  Jennifer Fogarty: Right, so a lot of our work ends up going across many humans. So you hear a lot about, especially with, you know, the recent [Extravehicular Activity] EVA was two women. It was, well how different are women? Are we making sure we understand across both sexes, across multiple heritages and races and, you know, backgrounds of any sort that you can imagine that influence, you know, lifestyle factors, that would change potentially outcomes. And also, the experience base that you come in with. So you talk about working out at the gym. So we have, you know, requirements for people to be healthy, of course. You know, you think about the astronauts and their robust human beings that are intelligent people that dedicate themselves to this endeavor. So, they are very invested in their health and wellbeing, so they take an active role in being very healthy individuals. But even when you work out, you could be squatting the same as another person and have very different outcomes. You're like why do I put on muscle, but this person doesn't? And how come I can't get rid of that body fat?  Host: The story of my life, really, in the gym. [Laughter]  Jennifer Fogarty: Pretty much. And then you see how complicated it is when you add on dietary factors, right, where, you know, supplements or, you know, you hear different fad diets that come up about and say one works for one person and one doesn't for another. Like, what is causing the difference between these people? And that's when you get into omics, you know, whether it be genomics or epigenetics or protium, the omics go on and on and on right now. But it's really understanding someone at a very molecular level to know if that is a key to understanding what's the better outcome. So, in addition to all the work that we do that characterizes the biology and the physiology, we're also moving into the domain of characterizing people on a molecular level. And you kind of have to think of it as a puzzle, that you don't have the picture in front of you. You have a lot of pieces, and you don't have the edges. So every time we get a piece of information that's about characterizing or measuring something you say OK, do these pieces link together? Do they relate to each other? And do they affect a dial? So it's, for me as a chief scientist, it's really looking at everybody who works for NASA, who's funded by NASA and actually, we even go beyond that because we rely on terrestrial research who are studying humans to give us clues about just humans. Because a lot of what we do is yes, you mention space has a lot of stressors and a lot of, those, pardon me, those are challenges, right. And even in the case of exercise, you intentionally go and stress your body, right. That's when we perceive stress to be a positive event. And so there are a lot of conditions where your body is responding to that stress. And the next time the reason you build muscle was because you broke it down. You caused a little bit of damage, and your body said all right, I'm going to repair myself and put a little extra down because the next time you come back and do that, I want to be prepared for it. And that's actually how you lay muscle fiber and get stronger and larger. And if you keep on adding load and keep on adding reps or do different types of intensity, you change the stressor, so your body has to continue to respond. So in our case, you have people who have done that for their lives going into spaceflight, and now in some ways, we take away stress. So going into microgravity is removing a signal. And so now the body's trying to consider, well do I continue to invest in this thing when you load me? Your bones and muscles in particular. Or do I kind of pull back on that investment because my energy is spent better elsewhere? And so the other kind of throw down term I use sometimes is the energy, the human body is the most energy efficient machine known to man. It will stop investing in things if you stop demanding of it. And when you demand of it, it'll go put energy in over here. And sometimes that makes a process we're not very fond of, you know. In our lifestyles you hear on Earth like with the rate of cardiovascular disease, you're like well why is that? You know, where is that coming from? What are we exposing ourselves to or what are, why are we inducing that process? And you know, you look down at this point they were like well, we look at a lot of the foods we eat and the types of foods we eat and the things that are in the foods we eat. But how does your liver respond? What have we set off in your liver which makes the lipids that aren't so good for your blood vessels, why is your liver responding that way? So, it's understanding cause and effect between a stressor and a response and then saying is that somewhere where we need to interfere or is there a different location that makes sense to kind of interfere with a process? So in spaceflight, when people say oh, you know, we want to stop bone loss and we want to stop muscle loss and we want to stop, you're like I understand where that comes from. But, you know, that resistance to change, thinking that's how we keep them healthy. But in all honesty, you've got to allow, you've got to be willing to think that change is not all bad. It's about does the change allow the person to accomplish the task they need to accomplish? So are they strong enough to do the job when they get where they need to go? So in the concept of us doing Mars exploration, after spending six to nine months in transit, probably in microgravity like they are today on the space station, you're going to see changes. Do we have them in a position on the day they land on Mars to be healthy and well enough to take care of themselves, recover, because it's going to be a rough landing, they're going to have to transition, but then are they strong enough to deal with what's 3/8’s gravity, 3/8’s of Earth's gravity? Will they be strong enough and healthy enough? So then we talk about, you know, risk for injury, whether it be fracture or, you know, muscle injuries, if they need to go off and do work. So we say, how do we measure change over time? And then how does that change match to the expectation and the outcome at the end? Which is for us is being healthy and well to live and work on Mars for some unknown period of time. OK, now we haven't quite gotten that data yet.  Host: That's right. So what I'm hearing is there's a lot of different fields, a lot of different considerations when it comes to human research. I'm hearing a little bit of overlap too between human research in space and human research on the ground and how this can be applied to even our own lives. So, I wanted to take kind of a step back and go through the history of Human Research Program and what we've been doing at NASA that's led up to this point and how it's organized now, to tackle all of these problems and all of these different areas that you started with. Let's go back in history. Let's take a look at human research through the beginning of when we started looking at it and the early times of NASA.  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah, and even, you know, the 50s, 50, 60 years ago, when you talk about the program that was in place, it was mainly medical to support the astronauts, whether it be Gemini, Mercury, Apollo, there were lots of unknowns. It was a very scary time. There were lots of hypotheses about what may or may not happen. It was really Mercury and Gemini that set the stage for when you put someone, and even the Russian attempts at same, just survival, you know. There were questions about could people swallow in microgravity? Thinking about, because the concept was, and not different than we think of it today, was you know, being almost upside down.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Fogarty: Right. Could you swallow against a pressure gradient or force that was in a different direction or lack of force. You know, it was just very confusing, and we didn't have a good way to simulate it. So the people who went before us had a lot of unknowns. You couldn't have told them what to expect. Really, it was about them telling you what they experienced. There were some animals sent ahead. You hear about the famous dogs and, you know, monkeys that went and survived. They ultimately may not have but not because of microgravity. You know, there were other problems with the vehicle or the way it came back. But I would say the premiere medical side and the data that was collected during Apollo where they did biomedical monitoring really set the stage for like well what was your blood pressure doing? What was your heart rate doing? What was your body temperature doing? And when did it change and why? And a lot of it had to do with psychological stress. I mean you talk about the Moon landing itself and kind of just suggesting, so the first time that lander was coming down, and they talk about the heart rates, you know. It just told us a lot about well it was a very normal response to something that was pretty scary at the time, right. Very low fuel. They were getting callouts about how close they were to the ground and having to put that lander down.  Host: This was the Apollo 11 landing, right?  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah, Apollo 11, yeah. So when you hear that audio recording, you yourself as a listener could get high heart rate, right. You can feel the stress and pressure that was going on. But we started to learn a lot about what happened that was completely normal. People were able to eat. People were able to sleep. The questions were, did we make it comfortable for them? Did we make it reasonable for them to live and work in that environment? Or did we cause more stressor than just being in space? And that's part of the work we do now so we don't add extra stress. But as that evolved from that Apollo biomedical program, the agency started to formulate something that was a little bit more structured which was called the bioastronautics roadmap. And through Skylab, which was actually a dedicated life science mission, and the biomedical results of Skylab which are several books on, you really start to learn about people being in space for longer periods of time and dedicated study of the human body. They even flew physicians for that purpose. And they went up in incrementally longer missions over the three Skylabs, so it was 30 to 60 to 90 days ultimately that they spent in space. They tried different modalities of exercise to see how that would work. And interestingly enough, all the Skylab crew members either maintained or gained weight. And they were more fit based on the exercise testing when they came back than before they left.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Fogarty: So when you think about the human ability to respond and rise to the challenge, if you give the body a challenge, it will respond. Microgravity was not an impediment to that. But, now it was about understanding, as missions changed and vehicles changed and the mission of those vehicles changed, if you're not dedicated for studying the human body and just working on it full time, maybe you're going to have some changes that are not negative, but you're going to have a decrease in body weight or a decrease in muscle mass. And it wasn't because the body couldn't do the opposite. It was just that we didn't provide the stressor because you're competing interests. Moving into the shuttle era, you know, those missions were about 14 days or less. We had several that were called extended duration orbiters. And one of them was, more than one of them was Extended Duration Orbital Medical Project, EDOMP. And there's actually several books on that that talk about all of the biomedical research that was done on shuttle. But again, shuttle, the way we talk about it is like a sprint. A two-week mission, maybe 17-day missions, but packed full of operations. A lot of it was science at the time, but a lot of it was construction. It could have been launching satellites. It could have been fixing telescopes, constructing the International Space Station. So when you are working full time, eating and exercising take a back seat, just like in your everyday life. So we started seeing people lose weight, and their body composition change a little bit, even in a two-week period, and we could measure it. And that's really when we started discovering things like the orthostatic intolerance. Because we had a lot more people flying. We had men and women flying. And they were dedicated toward operations. And so the human need kind of took a little bit of a back seat. So, that led to a lot of understanding about what we were capable of doing, depending on how you designed the operations of the mission. In 2000, when they launched space station, the idea was these people were going up and going up for longer durations. At the time it was probably more like four months, three, four months, not quite the six months and more that we're doing now. But that's a marathon compared to shuttle. And so you really had to understand where were we going with expectations on the human, and were we providing what the human needed over time to still be healthy and functionally, perform well, given that they had a mission to do. And even during shuttle, I came to NASA in 2004, so early part of ISS, the evolution I've seen in the International Space Station, finishing construction now in its utilization phase, but also how we think of managing the crew and their health and wellbeing both physically and psychologically over time is to sustain them over very long what is essentially deployments. So, it's evolved the way we do our science, the way we're trying to study the human plus the techniques have become more and more modernized as terrestrial techniques have, of course. But it's with that eye on exploration because we're using that platform, ISS as Mars forward. So you say if you do 600, which is why we're asking for a year on station like we did with Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko. Because time course, understanding the change over time, is incredibly important for us to be able to predict other time courses. Because we're really being asked for mission to Mars being anywhere from 24 to 36 months, depending how long they actually stay on the Martian surface. And those are just really unprecedented durations and exposures. So, if we want to have any confidence in what we're predicting, we need experience and really some solid data throughout the mission, and I'll expand on that a little bit, than we did before. Because the most robust measures you can do are really pre-post when we get them back on Earth, you know and you think about big machines like (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) MRI, invasive procedures where they're a little bit more risky to the person you want to make sure you want to have a sterile environment. So on space station, or in any, even on shuttle, we tend to do things that are very minimal, very, as much noninvasive as possible to keep the risk down to the person to the mission. But you really struggle for good what's called time force data from a science perspective. So we're trying to fill in those gaps in the middle and not just rely on pre-post. We need a lot more data in the middle.  Host: Data is good.  Jennifer Fogarty: Data is good.  Host: That's why we have the space station is a great place for that. A lot of people going up, so a lot of datasets. You mentioned 2004 was when you came to NASA. I think that was about the same time HRP started, the Human Research Program. So, you mentioned you've seen a fundamental shift in the way that we approach long duration spaceflight and the priorities of people in space. Tell me how that's progressed from when you came on, with maybe specifically the Human Research Program but really, really focusing on that progression. What were the questions we were asking and then filling in the gaps for?  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah, so it was a real, I think, fortunate time because I saw both sides of it even though it was the tail end of what was called the bioastronautics roadmap. So you're right, it was about 2004, and that had a lot to do with the development of Constellation and how the agency was reorganizing itself to support Constellation which was, of course, Orion and SLS at the time and a bit of a different structure. So, the concept was with bioastronautics roadmap that the mandate was every broad. It was a lot about doing excellent science, excellent study of the human, but it didn't quite have the mandate to be very mission-oriented with the concept of a Mars mission only. It was a little more open than that. So, it didn't have that applied mandate. And with the formation of Constellation, the restructure with kind of in the agency, there was a shift toward needing a more dedicated applied human research program. So, they did actually stand up in around 2004, 2005, we did a lot of work to develop the content and kind of down select what needed to be focused on, which resulted in kind of the risks you see today are articulated in the Human Research Program and the human research roadmap. But it was quite a process through a lot of boards, a lot of vetting, a lot of external oversight of how those decisions were made, different priorities. But it did ultimately kind of segue itself into the Human Research Program. And the elements that you see today, I think we've done some collapsing because we understand the integrated nature of things. But it was broken out to kind of represent the five major disciplines that we thought existed at the time that could cover the content that would lead toward more applied results so that our focus is producing results that actually translate into an operational impact. And as you mentioned before, it could be technology. It could be a way to monitor something. It's definitely going to have to be the evidence base to interpret what you measure and then the idea of actionable. What came out of this, that means we take what action for the individual. And then on top of it, we're also responsible for the medical architecture which says when you can measure something, you can interpret it, and you know what actions you take, you'd better have the medical system to do it. So what do you prepack? How do you send someone with a medical system when they do need care, and you can document that, how do you make sure the care is there for them to have? Because you already had to know that ahead of time.  Host: Yeah, there's a lot of, the way you're saying this is structured, there's a lot of practicality, there's a lot of preparedness versus maybe the idealistic approach where, you know, you have to fit it into operations. So how can we best make that efficient?  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah, that's exactly right.  Host: So let's go into how, you just talked about five elements that makes up, what are the five focus areas of Human Research Program?  Jennifer Fogarty: OK, so right now we have human factors and behavioral performance. And that actually is one that is a collapsed group from the early start of the Human Research Program. So, and there's a lot of overlap when you think about the psychological underpinnings of how someone is managing their environment and their wellbeing in an environment. So when you think about where you live and work here on Earth, you've got a lot of latitude to probably change your environment. So you could reorganize your office. You can reorganize your home. You can add and subtract furniture. If, you know, in certain cases, if you're dissatisfied with your location, particularly your home, you can go buy a new one. Your office, not so much. But you make do. But you've got some freedom to alter your space, to suit yourself. And if you don't, you actually have some recourse to probably go make something else happen. In the case of spaceflight, once that vehicle is designed and those decisions are made, pretty much there's no latitude to make a lot of changes and accommodations.  Host: You're stuck with it.  Jennifer Fogarty: Of any real significance.  Host: Sure.  Jennifer Fogarty: You're like yes, you can put different things up on the wall and you might be able to move some stuff slightly, but in general, it is a fixed location, and it's definitely a fixed volume. And the volumes you're talking about are incredibly small. Station actually right now is a very large volume with respect to what we think the future exploration volumes will be. So we make sure people understand that it is a national laboratory dedicated for science, but it's not as isolated or confined as one may think. But having said that, the human factor's behavioral performance also studies the psychological health and wellbeing, the emotional health, the psychosocial health, because the idea is I mentioned before the word deployment in the Department of Defense and military deployments, we very much recognize the stressors that go along with being far away from family, having limited communication. Understanding the trials and tribulations are going on back at home and you can't help, you know, those feelings. And your family feeling like I don't have access to you. You're not there for me. Well, for astronauts, it's very much the same paradigm. So we can learn a lot from each other in that arena, but we have different circumstances in that we can't bring somebody back from deployment very easily, especially on exploration missions. It's actually not an option at all. Once they burn for Mars, they will have to go to Mars to return. So there's no option of terminating that mission early.  Host: That's just physics.  Jennifer Fogarty: That's just physics.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Fogarty: But preparing someone and the family for those expectations and knowing how to handle them and the idea of communication will become harder and harder. That communication delay is only going to grow and make it impossible to have a real time conversation. So how do you manage the psychological health of someone when they're going through that process? What tools do they need to manage that? And what kind of avenues can we give them that, like we called them before, countermeasures, relief, so that they have some connection back to home. Because even in the most extreme case, not only are they going to lose communication, but they will lose sight of the planet Earth.  Host: Yeah, that's right.  Jennifer Fogarty: And there's lots of concerns about that eventuality.  Host: It's starting to make sense why these are intertwined, right. The human and machine integration but also that psychology, you know, that mental state of being in space and being in this spacecraft. You can see why those are intertwined.  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah, because the vehicle is going to have to compensate in a lot of ways. So when we talk about some of the countermeasures being augmented reality or virtual reality, well those are all great ideas, and we test them. And there's a lot going on here on Earth, you know, particularly in the entertainment community, about what those things bring to the table and how you use them. There's a lot going on with training people with them, immersing you in an environment before you actually go there. So you have a different level of experience and training. But we have to go as far as writing requirements that tell vehicle designers what that means to have them on board. You know, not even from a physical manifestation. That's one element. But how do you move data? How do you give it proper power? How do you make it available for four people or six people or whatever the number is going to be? Those are very specific needs that we have to articulate, because if we don't do that, it's not just going to be there by accident. It has to be there very intentionally and by design. So the level of detail we have to come up with to express to the designers and the planners what that means. And then the operational use of it. You know, when does it most benefit them? How do they get access to it? So, those are very much intertwined. I think it's working quite well. That's one of the elements, and I'm going to deep dive into those. Extraordinary work going on for sure. We work in a lot of different venues to try to really tease out some of the different stressors. So some interesting work in Antarctica and Moscow and actually here at Johnson Space Center. So, we don't turn down an opportunity to study exploration and isolation for sure.  Host: For our listeners, stay tuned, because we are going to take a deep dive into each of these elements. I think the next one is, the one I have at least on my sheet is exploration medical capability.  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah, so before we talked a little bit about that medical system of the future, those are the folks that are responsible for understanding of all the data coming out of our program, out of terrestrial medicine, pretty much any way where we can get it. Like, how do we envision the medical system of the future? Because right now, most of the time as people receive medicine, it's a very personal and in-person experience, right. You go to a doctor, at a minimum, you talk on the phone. But normally, you go physically to the office to interface with someone or physically to a hospital. Remotely and on space station we have things such as telemedicine. So we use a lot of devices such as ultrasound that can take images. We've got video where we can look at crew members and watch them do a procedure. We can talk to them about their symptoms. You can get a sense of the color of their skin and, you know, how do their eyes look. And you can have one crew member examine the other crew member to give us that kind of physical report. And telemedicine can work really well. Because a lot of that data comes down and will go to the specialist to interpret and provide care. In the future, because of the communication delay, telemedicine won't work. It's just not practical. There's no way to communicate. You're talking in the best case scenario in the Mars orbit, it's 20 minutes each way for a piece of information to move. So 40 minutes roundtrip to communicate a word or two or a sentence back and forth that's typed, not spoken. In some cases, depending where the orbits are, the sun could completely block us and for many weeks to months we could have total blackout of comm. So, and there are some different strategies saying maybe you could get around that, but it's not going to be less than 40 minutes. It's going to be a lot more than 40 minutes to ping a signal off different satellites that are deployed. But the reality was telemedicine isn't going to work. So how do we give, not only the physical tools to do medicine but the decision support? How do you give crew members, and one of them, you know, based on our standards and recommendations, will be a trained physician. But you can't rule out that the physician won't become ill.  Host: Oh yeah.  Jennifer Fogarty: You're still going to need a lot of decision support, and what does that mean? So that's often like, you know, people might go to WebMD or whatever to read up, you know, whatever research you can get on the web. But we want to create kind of the ultimate in a decision support tool that gives them the best evidence base. So when they enter symptoms or describe a problem that themselves or another crew member is having, it can bring up kind of a differential diagnosis that they can walk through so they can understand, well what test do I do next to narrow down what problem we're having, and what is the ultimate treatment? It also has to be connected to the medical kit, the idea of well, if we're going to give advice on what treatment, we should have that treatment with us. You know, suggesting taking something that you don't have with you doesn't do anybody any good. So we're also going to have to have inventory management to understand what's there. And there's a lot of different solutions to this, I mean even potentially people want to talk about 3D printing of medications. And that's all very good and synthesizing stuff real time is really very interesting. But that also uses a lot of resources, and you have to take a lot of raw materials. So, part of our job is to quantify the different options, test the different options, and that's where we use station as a national lab say maybe to troubleshoot some things. But then explain, it's called trade space if you're going to take a band-aid or you're going to take an ibuprofen or if you're going to take a different medication, they all have to be compared to one another about how often would we use them, how much benefit to get from them? You know, how many outcomes does this impact, and how much do we have to take per person for the crew? So, the exploration medical capability folks ingest a lot of data. They also do a lot of modeling and probabilistic risk assessment, and those are data hungry tools that we just have to keep pouring more and more data into, and we have to partner with groups that are collecting data such as the (Food and Drug Administration) FDA and (National Institutes of Health) NIH and other entities that we might find that are interested in working with us. We do a lot at conferences to talk about who's got data out there that can help us really sharpen kind of what does it mean to be a human and how do these decision support tools evolve. Because they're actually more and more common even in hospitals and in the office space to give doctors kind of the real time feedback on, especially when they're looking at something unusual and they have to do a, try to do a rapid diagnosis, there are definitely some decision support tools evolving out there. And even something like you hear a lot about IBM Watson.  Host: Right. Something smart, in-house, not connected to the internet.  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah, and that'll be our case in terms of we could in the background upload new and different stuff, and it would be vetted. That's the other part of this that we don't do anything that's not validated. So it takes a lot of work to say we're very confident and comfortable that this is actually the data that we think is really the data that should go and inform the crew versus a lot of folks they'll say, well why don't you do cutting edge, or you know, this is the newest journal article that came out. And I was like well that's great. Now we got to see the test of time.  Host: Right.  Jennifer Fogarty: You know, it has to be redone. Someone else has to independently verify that those are accurate results before we would kind of really ingest them.  Host: Yeah, maybe reliability is more of a concern. But what it sounds like, what it really comes down to is deep space exploration has a lot of constraints. If you could, you could just bring everything you wanted and have instant communication, but that's not the case.  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah. And it comes down to, I mean when we say vehicle, I think it conjures up a car or a plane what people are used to and kind of the paradigm of being able to get more or different along the way. And for the Mars mission, that's not the case whatsoever. You can't even do resupply. You can pre-deploy and catch up to something. But you still had to prospectively determine what that stuff was you sent. So I always describe it now as, you know, we're really building an exoplanet. We're not really building a vehicle.  Host: Wow, that's an interesting way to think of it.  Jennifer Fogarty: Because I think it kind of makes you step back and like, oh if I had to think about all the air, water, oxygen, food and nutrients, all the medical like, that's a much bigger undertaking than the concept of a vehicle, to me anyway.  Host: Yeah, absolutely. Let's go to the next one. The next one is countermeasures, human health countermeasures.  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah, so this is really where the physiology, the deep dive into human physiology, that change over time, that characterizing how the human body adapts to spaceflight, in what direction do these systems go and why? And if we need a countermeasure, how do we develop them? And the other art of this is when you test a countermeasure, you definitely are looking for the outcome of interests, like you'll have a hypothesis. Let's just take something very tangible in terms of muscle loss. So we're going to do resistive exercise, because we know that loading skeletal muscle will at least maintain skeletal muscle volume and strength. So our hypothesis is going to be if we can load somebody one hour a day, you know, with so many pounds or force, you know, we can achieve that. But what we also have to make sure is while we're looking at that and testing that hypothesis that we look on the other side which is what risks could we be causing by doing the countermeasure. So your body does change in space, as I said. One of the things, and you hear about a lot, is people come back taller. You know, I think this gets tweeted about a bit.  Host: Yeah, like two inches or something.  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah, it ends up being a couple centimeters, can be as much as, it can be as much as an inch or so. And what's interesting is every day and night, our body goes through a lengthening and a shortening process. So at night, while you're laying down, your spine kind of expands and it unloads, and you are a little taller in the morning when you stand up than you are when you go to bed at night. Because you compress yourself, because you're vertical in gravity, and you got squishy stuff between each of your vertebrae and on the disks. And your body kind of settles down and you go through like this kind of cyclic nature. That's a very normal process for your spine. But when crew members go into spaceflight, it's not only laying down, but we said slightly head down would be kind of the feeling anyway. So your body gets unloaded for long periods of time. Well, your spine not only elongates, but it actually straightens. And there's been a lot of reports of back pain over decades now of spaceflight. This really, we couldn't understand why. Well, we think we finally figured it out and that as the spine straightens, all the muscles and ligaments that allow your spine to be, and your spine should be in an S-shape, well, when it's straighter than the S-shape, those ligaments now are being stretched and muscles being stretched in a way that's pretty uncomfortable while you're adapting. Well, when you exercise, if we were to load somebody on their shoulders like in a squat, and now your spine is no longer that S-shape, it's now more straight, we have a little potential for having, we think, a risk-- an injury to your disks or your vertebra.  Host: Interesting.  Jennifer Fogarty: So we would carefully load somebody or change the way you would hold the bar. And we design exercise equipment, of course, so we could take into consideration that change. Because we want to get the benefit of the countermeasure and minimize or eliminate any risk. So we're often, I think we talk about it a lot more on Earth when we talk about medications. You talk about the reason you're taking the medication and the effective reason and then the side effects, you know, like how much side effects am I willing to tolerate to get the benefit? So each countermeasure has to be looked at in that way. So we have to make sure we pay attention to not only what we wanted it to do or what we thought it was going to do but the things we didn't understand, like the unintended consequence. So that element is really designed to look across at all those things.  Host: Yeah, you need that deep focus because it's not just OK, yeah, we're going to do resistive exercise, because it goes a little bit deeper than that.  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah, and if we're going to do it, how do you do it safely to maximize benefit and minimize risk. So yeah, that's really what they do. And it's a very broad portfolio. Like I said, you'll see gastrointestinal, immune, cardiovascular.  Host: Alright.  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah, so they're an exciting group, and they've got a lot of breadth and depth for sure.  Host: Yeah, I can't wait to talk to them. We'll take a deep dive with them too. Next one is research operations and integration.  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah, that is our implementing arms. So, one of the interesting parts of the work we do is doing science in space is incredibly challenging. You are probably not going to have most of the tools you're traditionally used to having at your bedside if you're a wet scientist. So this is the group of experts that really get us to the point where we can fly and experiment. And we have confidence that the experiment will produce results we can interpret. So we just talk about really like a type two error, which is, you know, getting a false negative. Those are things you really want to avoid. Like I just didn't do my measurements correctly, and I missed the signal. False positives are another one, but those you can design to test for. So but this group is really a specialist in saying, how do we, if a development of hardware, how do we make it spaceflight worthy? How do we test it too into space? How do we launch it? How do we write procedure so that the crew can operate it and deploy it? Sometimes it's medical testing. Like venipuncture, how do you take blood sample from yourself or each other? They do the crew training for that. They are also very helpful in managing blood volume. So lots of people right now I mentioned diving into the molecular world and omics. Omics relies on things like blood as a large staple of their resource to do their experiments. So, we have limits on how much blood we can take from each crew member per month. So they kind of, what we call it racking and sacking, we look across who's in the flight queue for blood volume. What are the priorities? What are the objectives? And kind of have to decide how the blood volume is used. They also design the tubes or certify the tubes to fly. We can't just fly any type of tube that you might get when you go get blood taken at your local phlebotomist. So they really do everything from the full life cycle of experimentation. They come in very early in our projects and do feasibility, so they tell us, you know, can this be flown this way or how much modification, how much hardware has to be built? They do the flight queue, and they also do what are called informed consent briefings of the crew, because they're all test subjects so they volunteer for our science. So they pretty much coordinate all of that. They also coordinate the data streams back to the investigators so that they can receive their data. And they help us manage what are called data sharing. You know, before you mentioned data is good. Well, it's even better when you don't have to be the one who collects it. You just get to share it, you know, someone else is getting it. Plus it makes the data more valuable --  Host: Right.    Jennifer Fogarty: --and keeps the burden off of say the crew from collecting the same thing ten times. So, they work really hard at finding those types of efficiencies so that we are as, like as least invasive and as least obtrusive to the crew. So, because they have other science they have to do. They have other operations they have to do.  Host: And they don't want their blood taken all the time.  Jennifer Fogarty: Not all the time. But they understand that bodily fluids are a precious resource, especially in astronauts. We make the best use out of them.  Host: That's a great way to put it. Big job, definitely, on that end. That's a big job. Let's wrap it up with space radiation. This is another big one, right.  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah, so space radiation is an interesting element. Not my background, so I've had to learn a lot about it in the past couple of years, more deeply than ever. So when I was on the operation side, it really was about safety in space. And we have a space radiation analysis group that monitors space weather that has a lot to do with the solar cycle. And there are different types of radiation in space, some that we don't really have to deal with here on Earth because we're protected by the magnetosphere. And the International Space Station has a pretty significant level of protection as well, not as good as we do, but it's not like deep space will be. So that's a whole different animal for sure from a radiation perspective. So the space radiation actually, before it became an element in HRP, was a program element. Actually, when I talked about like the bioastronautic roadmap, it actually was this other program element, wasn't quite a big program P like ISS program, but it had its own life. And it was really dedicated using an Earth-based simulator at a Department of Energy facility that we use at Brookhaven National Laboratory. And a variety of experiments say what is the biological impact of these things that are called heavy ions, which again, are the particles that don't make it through our atmosphere and kind of affect us. So we don't really have any Earth-based data to tell us what is the biological relevance? But there are lots of unknowns about, we do understand humans and radiation from the gamma and x-ray perspective, you know. Those are a large resource of that data tells us epidemiologically what happens like after Hiroshima and Nagasaki has been a reference of populations as a, what happens to these humans, if they survive it, when do the different disease processes start to take place and how severe are those disease processes? So the big one that's always discussed is cancer.  Host: Right.  Jennifer Fogarty: Right. And that's a very common, and you can see the mental connection between something damaging your body in that way and turning a cell to a direction where it proliferates in an uncontrolled manner and becomes a cancerous source. So there's a lot to be concerned about. But we are learning more and more about how we study it, to be honest. Recently, we just had advances made at the facility where they can do what's called GCR, which is galactic cosmic rays, a simulation of it. And that means you can run a complex series of these heavy ion beams in your experiment, which is more similar-- I guess that's how –[Laughter]  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Fogarty: more similar to deep space radiation than ever before. But we're really excited about some opportunities with Gateway and the lunar opportunities to characterize and design experiments to study deep space radiation there that will give us the opportunity to validate all of the work we've done on the ground to be able to make I think stronger conclusions. The key thing there is understanding potential for countermeasures. So we work actually with a lot of folks who use radiation as a source of therapy for cancer treatments. So particularly proton therapy is of interest to us because the idea is they need and want to cure you of your cancer today, and they may use radiation to do that. But that may inadvertently give you a different cancer later in your life, because it'll damage tissue in the surrounding area. So they want to prevent that in the future as well, the medical community does. So they are actually studying a lot of treatments that you would give at the time you receive that radiation therapy to protect the healthy tissue. So it's one of those, again, just like we have that tension and have to struggle with choices of today about effects of tomorrow. So we are learning a lot from them that on a biological level, how can we protect people in general from radiation damage? So I think we've made some progress there, but we're going to continue to invest in it. And that element will have definitely some interesting stuff to tell you.  Host: Yeah, I'm definitely seeing why there are these elements, why they're organized the way they are and why you need such depth. You need those checks and balances, right, because you can come up with a solution, but you need to make sure that that's a good solution. You mentioned the radiation example. You mentioned the countermeasure example when you're in those workouts, you don't want those negative effects. Moving to risks, you know, we're talking about how, what happens to the human body. We want to understand that. We want to develop countermeasures for that to protect the humans and make them successful ultimately. But I know there are these risks that are identified. And there's a number, there's 33 risks that's identified for human spaceflight. We don't have to go through all 33, but in general, what do they tell us? What do they provide for the, you know, us understanding what questions to ask when doing human research?  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah, so I think it is exactly that. It is a framework to help us get our arms around the human system within human spaceflight. So, there's a lot of debate, and there has been for decades actually, more decades than you and I have been around for, about these risks. And even when I mention the bioastronautic roadmap, my very first meeting I went to, newly minted employee, was a bioastronautic roadmap meeting. And the whole thing was about what was called lumping and splitting. So when you have these risks, when you're going to talk about the human, you can always group them in different ways, or you can split them out to be more and more sensitive or specific. And there's always groups of thought that will pull you in one way or the other. But eventually, in order to get some work done, you kind of have to consent on a format that we're just going to agree to, put our disagreements aside and say OK, given the lumping and the splitting that's gone on, do these represent holistically a way that we can get at the totality of the human to know if we're good to go to an exploration mission or not? So based on that evolution from bioastronautics roadmap to the Human Research Program was already that down select process. And I kind of mentioned a lot of vetting had gone on, a lot of external review had gone on that said that these really represented the biological systems in their totality. And that underneath each of those risks are many risk factors that if you really looked at you're like OK, I can see how one, almost every risk is linked to one or more other risks, going back to even your countermeasure statement that there's no one thing in your body when you think about the dials that if you turned it slightly that you wouldn't be turning another dial that you'd better be keeping your eye on. So, it's, again, there's a lot of potential there for someone else to have a different perspective and articulate them differently. But I think the consensus is those represent the best holistic approach to covering the human system within spaceflight. We do structure them in a way that we use probabilistic risk assessment and another board process that gives us a likelihood and consequence. And that's really where they get their priority ranking. And that says, there's so much we either don't know about this thing, and the consequences could be so severe that it's going to get what's called a red. And that really at this point from the Human Research Program and the agency perspectives, red is very typically communicated not unlike anyone else who uses red which is stop. It is a no go. Like this risk is not in a posture that's acceptable, and we have a lot of work to do to get this into an acceptable risk posture so that we can fly. So you'll see a group of red, like if you go to the HRP website, it's a very transparent document that we use, and then there's a group that are yellow, and those are caution. Those either say that we haven't completely mitigated it or we don't know enough about it to mitigate it completely. We've got open questions. But it's not in the area of catastrophic outcomes that we're saying that it's a no go. It's just there's a lot of caution to be used there. And then we have risks that we think we've characterized enough, and we know good mitigation strategies that we call them green. And those are ones that we've kind of deprioritized, and I don't want to kind of mischaracterize them. It's not that we actually don't do work on them, because they're involved with the other risks. But they are not the primary target of reducing any further. A byproduct of a really good countermeasure for a red or a yellow could make a green even better. You'd want to make sure, going back to your earlier statement. You don't want to inadvertently turn a green yellow or a green red by a countermeasure that you injected in another area. And so we're constantly looking across the risks whenever we alter one. And remember, we're doing this on paper right now. But there is usually data that tell you to crosstalk between risks, and you really have to pay attention to that. And there have been occasions where we would design or we would look for work that was designed to kind of pull out that kind of detail that helped us understand better the crosstalk between risk. Because sometimes it's not so obvious, particularly in areas that are continually emerging like the immune system and the microbiome, of course, which doesn't sit neatly in any one element, because it's present throughout the body, can affect multiple systems, can be affected by multiple systems. So it doesn't seem to have a start or a finish. It's just always in the mix, so it has to be assessed even when you're doing things you wouldn't have anticipated. So if you're doing understanding psychological stress, you would want to measure the immune system and the microbiome. If you think you're going to give a nutritional supplement and improve the microbiome, you probably should measure output of behavior.  Host: They're linked.  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah, they're linked. And there's more and more data terrestrially to talk about behavioral disorders and the microbiome and treatments of the microbiome that have been very impactful to those behavioral disorders. And it's very unexpected. They don't, they can't tell you how, but that's one where a correlation is so strong it is verging on causality. They just can't pinpoint the mechanism. And there is a thing called the gut brain axis to pay attention to. So how your mind works and how your GI tract works and vice versa. So that, again, probably hinges on the microbiome and a lot of messaging, whether it be chemical messages or hormonal messages. But they are definitely communicating with each other. And so any interventions that we do or test have to look at all of those systems simultaneously. And that's the power of getting samples and sharing data that we don't have to stand up a unique protocol for an experiment, but we can make sure that we have a standard protocol that's used to give us a good reference point. And that's something we instituted pretty recently which was called standard measures for that particular effort.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Fogarty: And is that we can gain a lot of efficiency this way, and we can also give a really good backstop of data of anyone doing anything experimental. So I think that's how the risks have been approached. We review them annually, and we work with another board called the human system risk board that has a lot of what we call stakeholders here. A lot of people have a voice at the table to weigh in on the evidence base and how we're calculating that likelihood by consequence and whether we're doing more work or different work. So, it's a very active part of our program, and it really determines kind of our priorities and how we go after the work that we do when we make our research announcements.  Host: There is so much to human research. I cannot wait to peel back the layers, but Jenn, what excites you about the future? Just everything we've talked about, you know, looking back, even looking back on all the human research since you came here in 2004 and what has progressed with human research just in that time. And then looking forward to, particularly Artemis, in the near future here and what we can look forward to for human research on the Moon.  Jennifer Fogarty: I think what's so exciting is every time we discover anything about the human body, it points to the amazing resilience and robustness of the human condition. Given the right raw materials, the right support system, the right consideration, we're a pretty amazing species. And I think we can rise to almost any challenge. I haven't seen one yet. So, I just think that, to find the data and see the data really help us, you know, zero in on how to enable the crew of the future and the diversity of crew that can go. You know, the no limits. And some of the best outcomes have come from the most diverse participants. So I think it's broken down all kinds of barriers and preconceived notions about who's fit for spaceflight and who's not. So Artemis, Artemis is opening up the window to deep space research for us that will give us a lot more confidence and ability to gain those insights about questions we've not been able to answer here on Earth because we just can't simulate that environment. We're trying to be really smart about it. I mean Artemis initially is going out as a very lean effort, landing people, and the first woman and the next man in 2024. I mean it's a full court press to accomplish that, to get a lander on a sent module that we don't have. So all resources are being put into accomplish that task. So we want to be on board. We want to be a great partner. We try to do things. So our key words are autonomous, light and lean. That's what our requirements are, and that's how we operate and kind of how MOD, which is our mission operations director that's trained like to fly, so we do science like we want to fly, you know. You have to have a vision for how this thing will come together in the end. You know, what is that, how will it manifest, because that needs to be in your mind as you're designing your way to get there. Because otherwise, you go a bit astray. You know, we have folks who want to do, you know, large devices, and everybody wants their own countermeasure. And you're like this will not be an active operational solution. So it's really integrating on all those complex challenges and results and going back to that picture where I don't have the puzzle box in front of me. Each time you get a new piece, it's really exciting to go back to the table and say where does this fit. What does it tell me about the other pieces I have here? Because it may cause a whole shift that I couldn't have anticipated. We do a lot of work in the Antarctic. That's been a real resource of some eye-opening isolation and confinement studies. So it's been pretty exciting to see how that's played a role. And that goes back again to like the immune system and things that look very much like station. We have human data from station, and we can find very similar human responses down the Antarctic, and people didn't expect that. So, some of it's not about being spaceflight per se, it's about being that challenge, that stressful environment and the human condition. So it's been an interesting equalizer along the way. But Artemis, yeah, definitely the challenge ahead of us, and it is definitely a Mars forward activity for us.  Host: Wonderful. Jenn Fogarty, this was a wonderful overview of all the human research and the history, current, future on everything human research. It was a pleasure talking to you today. Thanks for coming on.  Jennifer Fogarty: Yeah, it was my pleasure being here. Thank you very much.  [ Music ]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 135, “NASA Tech in the World.” I'm Gary Jordan. I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. We talk a lot about important technologies for human spaceflight on this podcast, everything from propulsion to life support systems to the way that humans are factored into hardware decisions. There's a lot of thought and time that goes into these technologies and inventions to help meet needs for human spaceflight. But these technologies can often be brought into the American economy for industries and even small companies to use in their own products. And when I say often, I mean it. There's a whole office called Technology Transfer that makes it all happen. And they publish a book every year with a patch list of ways NASA technology ends up in our lives. So, here, to go over this program and how it all works is Kris Romig, Commercialization Services Lead in the Technology Transfer Office. He has experience with a little thing called rocket propulsion. Very smart guy. So, here we go, how NASA technology ends up in our lives and all over the world with Kris Romig. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Kris, thanks so much for coming on the podcast today.  Kris Romig: Thank you.  Host: Tech transfer, this is an interesting topic because yes, we're talking about NASA technologies, but the idea here is that you take these NASA technologies and then they go out into the public. I'm very curious on how that all happens.  Kris Romig: Yeah, no, thanks for having me onboard here today to talk about that. It's a topic that I'm incredibly passionate about. I've spent 20 years here at NASA doing a bunch of different things. And it's something I keep coming back to, is how do we better engage the public, not just from an outreach perspective, but the technologies and innovations that are developed to send humans safely into space. How does that help everyone here on Earth, right? And so, we have a formal process called technology transfer it is a formal program that's mandated by Congress that every federal agency have. And it was actually part of our founding in the 1958, you know, National Aeronautics and Space Act that, you know, the agency should go off and do the things that we're going to do for the benefit of everyone. And so, since then, we've gotten procedures and policies and programs in place to execute that more efficiently. But the primary purpose of it is to make sure that NASA technologies, whether they're a hardware, whether it's software and models, simulations, apps, cool tech in general, is going out into the public domain. And there's a lot of different ways that we do that, some of them informally, some of them formally. But the point is to try to raise, you know, everybody's awareness of the agency, and try to get the technology infused into really the commercial sector.  Host: I'm going to lock onto one of the first things you said.  Kris Romig: Yeah.  Host: Which was that this is, this is a very standard practice when it comes to government agencies.  Kris Romig: Yes.  Host: It's, I guess the idea is it's not a copyright of the federal government. Is it to enable the growth of the economy so commercial companies can go and do --   Kris Romig: That tends to be the big one is economic development. Right? Industrialization, manufacturing, those types of things. And so, I like to think of it as we are content providers to industry, to academia, to then take our technologies and commercialize them, turning them into products, take those technologies, evolve them even further beyond what we did and do new and innovative and great things. Sometimes that technology comes right back to NASA, because it helps us solve our own problems.  Host: Oh, wow.  Kris Romig: Which is, which is fantastic. And then other times, they just go off and create commercial products that, you know, are for the betterment of everyone.  Host: I like that, solve our own problems. Do you have a good example of that, like something that we've sent out, and then they turned it into something else useful, and we said, “oh, maybe we can use that again?”  Kris Romig: Yeah, so the one that comes to mind specifically from Johnson Space Center is our inflatable habitat technology, which was developed in the 90s, and called a TransHab here. So, there were a number of patents around that technology. And we then licensed it to a commercial space company who matured that technology over the last several years and then created an inflatable module that is now currently flying on the International Space Station.  Host: Oh, BEAM.  Kris Romig: Yeah, [Bigelow Expandable Activity Module], BEAM. So, as we start to look at exploration and to the Moon and Mars and beyond, figuring out how to pack more volume into the payload fairings of launch vehicles and reducing mass, inflatable technologies are very compelling to a lot of the architecture studies that we do. So, the fact that there was a commercial company that went out and invested in the technology and improved it from where we had stopped working on it ourselves, and then we were able to partner with them to bring it back, and then there's a collaboration between we're providing an asset, the International Space Station, in which the BEAM module can be part of, and so they can continue doing research and demonstrate the feasibility of this technology.  Host: Yeah, the idea is they licensed the idea, but that maturation, that's really what the value is back to NASA.  Kris Romig: That's right. Yeah. And there's a lot of different areas that we're always looking for companies to do that. Right? So, a lot of times we will look at technology transfer in the context of we will patent a technology and write a license with a company for them to go have access to that patent, to go work on it, mature it as a commercial product. But we typically like to couple that with a partnership agreement as well, so there's continuation of the development of the technology where our NASA subject matter experts still get to participate in the maturation of those technologies, because we're investing in them because we're trying to solve problems for ourselves most frequently. Right? And so, anybody who takes that tech and matures it along a similar path to what we would then go use it for in the future is really just a win win. If they have other customers besides NASA that will buy it from them, that's fantastic, and we can come back and say, “hey, this is great, you've helped us mature technology that we didn't need to invest all of our resources.”  Host: I am super curious on how this all works. So, let's go into --    Kris Romig: Sure.  Host: Let's go into the details of how this is. So, so, let's, actually, let's back up to more we talked about the genesis of the program. This is something that is, it is common across many federal agencies.  Kris Romig: All federal agencies, yep.  Host: All federal agencies to have some way to take the technologies, the ideas, and put them out into the world, for economic development, for all of these reasons. Tell me about the tech transfer program, I guess as we see now, what is it, and what are we doing, and what are the different ways and processes on how we're taking that technology and putting it out?  Kris Romig: Yeah, absolutely. And I will say it's something that continues to evolve. Right? So, it's been part of the agency for decades. And so, we're always trying to make sure that we are staying on top of communication techniques, you know, people are sourcing information from the internet now and apps and social media, something that wasn't a big deal 10 years ago. So, we're having to evolve how we're communicating with industry and academia on what technologies are being developed. But by and large, the process is this. Innovators at NASA, whether they're developing software, or they're developing hardware technologies, provide a disclosure to the Technology Transfer Office, basically disclosing or describing the technologies that they've invented or worked on. We take that internally. We work with our patent council at the center to determine whether or not that's possible for getting a patent for the technology. So, things that we consider when we patent technologies, most of the things we don't patent. It's probably only about 5, 6 percent of technologies that get reported to the office here at JSC every year actually go forward for a patent application. Some of the reasons are whether or not it's innovative enough, you know, in searching for prior art, are there technologies that are similar, you know, is it new and novel? For us is the commercial viability. Right? So, we don't, as an agency, patent technologies for the sake of patenting it. We're not a profit seeking organization. So, for us, the primary drive for us to patent technology is to provide a commercial value or competitive advantage to a company who would want to come license that technology. So, we're not trying to make money off of those license deals. We're doing it specifically, so we have competitive advantage and rationale for a business to come in and say, I want to invest in a license from NASA for this technology, which then allows them to be the sole owner or user of that technology for commercial purposes if it's an exclusive license. The benefit is then they can have a leg up on competition and get out in the commercial market. If all the technology was just free for anybody who came, there's some technologies that would never be picked up because it's too easy for competitors to come in and take up the same technology. So, there's no competitive advantage. So, those are some of the things that we really look for when we decide whether or not we want to patent a technology.  Host: Yeah, you're thinking about when you transfer the technology.  Kris Romig: Yes.  Host: How is that going to boost the economy?  Kris Romig: Right.  Host: So, maybe the technology can be implemented just for the benefit of everyone. And maybe that's the best, maybe that's the best way to transfer that technology. But, you know, for something like that, where you said expandable habitats, is that one that was a licensed, a patented, licensed?  Kris Romig: Yeah, that was one we patented. And I'll tell you, it's evolved where now with the emergence of the commercial space industry where it's at right now, we're starting to look at patenting more technologies and different technologies that we would have before because there used to be something where it's an [Extravehicular Activity] EVA suit glove or something like that, where we're like, look, you know, we do our own development with these types of things, there's no commercial, you know, interest in a product like that beyond what we're using them for -- our EVA suits. But now that's changing. Right? And now we're looking and we're going, wow, there may be commercial astronauts, there's other activities going on in space, so we want to take another look at EVA tools and [Environmental Control and Life Support Systems] ECLSS technologies and things that, you know, 10 years ago we would have said, eh, there's no commercial interest. Is it novel? Yes. Is it unique? Yes. But we won't patent it. And so, in those things, when we don't patent them, the way we transfer that out into the public is usually writing technical papers, conference papers, going out into the community in that way, which engineering assigned staff across the agency do on a regular basis. I think there's something like 7,000 publications that go out of the agency every year. Right? And we probably will license 100 to 120 technologies a year. Right? So, there's a big difference. You know? So, regardless of whether there's a formal license or it's just a get the tech out into the public domain through a conference paper, or put it out on a website, we promote all of those types of things. My office is really geared towards the mechanization of the licensing and patent process, because that's the more formal thing. And most of the scientists, engineers and technical staff that are doing the innovations, they want to go out and do the conference papers and the speak, and we certainly want them to go do that.  Host: Yeah, and they can speak to it maybe a little bit better too.  Kris Romig: Oh, absolutely. Right? And so, the other part of it is then software we treat a little bit differently. Software is one where we try to get that out into the public domain as much as possible. We have what's called a NASA software catalog. So, somebody can go to software.NASA.gov, search for a software that NASA has in that catalog, and I think it's around 650 different software’s that are in there right now.  Host: Oh, wow.  Kris Romig: And they can fill out a form that gets submitted to NASA, and it's free. There is no fees associated with it. It's universities, small businesses, even individuals. Right? Now they're different categories of how, you know, we have to protect things from [International Traffic in Arms Regulation] ITAR and different perspectives, you know, from the international community.  Host: Sensitivity sort of?  Kris Romig: Right.  Host: Maybe export control.  Kris Romig: If there was a software that was reported to the Tech Transfer Office that was purely for ballistic reentry trajectory analysis, we may not want that software to be widely available to folks who may, you know, wish to use it for, you know, creating intercontinental ballistic missiles. Right?  Host: Naturally.  Kris Romig: Right. But if it's, you know, some other types of software that sometimes it's business efficiency software or communication tools and things like that, we want that to be publicly available.  Host: Yeah, yeah. So, if I, if I were to sum up, you know, what your office does, as you're looking at all of this, these technologies, and you are, it is your job to think of the best ways to get this out into the economy.  Kris Romig: That's exactly right.  Host: Yeah.  Kris Romig: And, fortunately, you know, we've got, you know, 3,000 civil servants here at Johnson Space Center that help do that. Right? Everybody is a representative of technology transfer, as far as I'm concerned. Anytime you're going out into the community and you're talking about the technologies and innovations that are going on at NASA, it's increasing that awareness. Right? Now, a lot of times the general public may not take advantage of those technologies. The awareness is great. Right? But we also want to help university students, you know, take technologies and mature them in their, you know, graduate research, or, you know, small businesses to start up and take that, you know, idea or that technology and go get some funding around it, start a business, and go off and do great things.  Host: So, how do you, how do you reach out to companies and to industries that, and say, by the way, this technology is available to you, here's how you can access it, and here's how you browse it, how do you, how do you reach out?  Kris Romig: Yeah, so, that is a number of different ways. A lot of it is we have a group across the Tech Transfer Program in the agency that goes to a lot of industry conferences. So, as we have themes of technology, whether it's aeronautics or whether it's optics or sensor technology, propulsion, we will send a group of folks from the Tech Transfer Program from around the agency to go to those conferences. They put a booth up, a lot of information. So, there's that knowledge exchange and information specifically for the Tech Transfer Program. We have most social media, you know, Facebook and, you know, some of the other social media avenues, Twitter, that were putting things out, putting blasts out when we're trying to push a particular technology. And then we also publish articles on what's called the Tech Brief. There used to be a NASA tech brief magazine. But that's evolved and is no longer associated directly, you know, from the agency perspective. But they used to publish our technology articles. So, we will feed them to that. And it's an industrial publication. So, it goes out into, I forget how many followers they have, or how many subscribers they have. It's in the thousands. And so, we'll put, you know, our various technologies in there. And they have themes every month of different tech that they're looking for. That's another way of getting it out.  Host: Very cool.  Kris Romig: Yeah.  Host: So, you specifically, do you have background in engineering or something that helps you to understand these processes? Or maybe, I don't know, public policy, you know, what’s your background?   Kris Romig: Yeah, so, good question. So, I've spent 20 years at the agency. I started out in propulsion. So, my background technically is as an engineer, cryogenic rocket propulsion, you know, development, modeling and analysis types of things. I've had the opportunity to spend most of my career here at Johnson Space Center. I spent a year at NASA headquarters in the Chief Engineer's Office, and just about six years at Goddard Space Flight Center. And that's really where I got introduced to the Tech Transfer Program myself as I did a rotational assignment in the Tech Transfer Program Office at Goddard Space Flight Center. And I thought, oh, this is great, you know, I love technology, I love innovation, and the ability to then have a program that helps get it out into the world, because over my engineering career, I had worked with a lot of small startup companies and businesses who we needed to build technology for our rocket engines and different things. It was like, wow, this is a great I love the energy, I love how passionate folks were to work with NASA, you know, the agility that they came as a small business, that they could turn things around much more quickly sometimes. And so, I just really got connected and impassioned about that part of it. And, you know, 18 years later, I was able to come back, you know, to Johnson Space Center and take over the Technology Transfer Office here. And so that's what I've been doing for a little over the last year is helping, you know, push JSC technologies out into the world.  Host: Yeah. So, one of the things that I think is most interesting, you talked about these technologies, or these ways, these avenues that you're communicating out and saying, look what we have available. You're doing print publications, you're doing, you're doing events, you're doing all of these different things. One of my favorites is something called spinoff. We actually reference it a lot in [Public Affairs Office] PAO. And even when we're talking about benefits for humanity, because you're talking about technologies that are in, that are in the world right now, possibly fully matured, or at least partially matured to some, to some reason. I think one of my favorites actually, I remember sitting in the education office when I was a student, it was like my first day, and so my mentor had like a meeting that was going for an hour, so I was just waiting in the lobby. I didn't even have a desk yet, so I didn't know where else to sit. So, I was sitting, I was waiting at the desk, and I had the spinoff magazine right in front of me, and I was flipping through it. And one that caught my eye in particular was, it was a trailer. And you may, you may know more about it. But it was a trailer that took technology from a guy who used to work on the modules of the space station, and he took that same technology and those same ideas of how to make something compact, how to make something light, how to make something efficient, and he turned it into like a trailer, like, kind of like an air stream, but its own thing. But, you know, I thought that was fascinating. So, I started researching it. I was like, oh, if I get one, I'll probably want one that a NASA engineer designed.  Kris Romig: Yeah, yeah. I'm familiar with that story. I don't have a lot of the technical details or background on it. But I've certainly heard that before. And the spinoff publication is a great publication that the agency has been pushing I think since the 1970s is when they started it.  Host: Wow.  Kris Romig: So, it's been every year we've been putting that book out. And, again, that's another area where we're continuing to evolve that. How do people digest information, and, you know, does the standard publication the right way of doing it, or print publication, but it's a, it's a great one, because there are those success stories basically is all the technologies that have gone out and been licensed, you know, the business world is tough. Right? So, just because NASA provides access to a technology doesn't mean a business will be successful. There's a lot that goes into, you know, successful product development that's beyond NASA's, you know, ability to help make sure that that happens. Right? But we're always happy to provide content in the ways of IP, or intellectual property. And so, the spinoff is really that, you know, amalgam of all the success stories from each year of those technologies where folks have gone off and commercially sold a product and are doing wonderful things. You know, one of the ones that comes to mind too is the winglets that we see on commercial aircrafts, when you look out across the wing and there's that upturned, you know, section at the end, or downturn, those winglets were developed by NASA engineers, you know, gosh, 20, 30 years ago, or even longer ago.  Host: Oh, wow.  Kris Romig: And so that got pushed out into the commercial aircraft market, because it makes them more fuel efficient. Right?  Host: Yeah, they're on all the aircraft now. [Laughter]   Kris Romig: Yeah.  Host: Right.  Kris Romig: So, there's a lot of NASA technologies and innovations that are buried in our culture, in the things that we use every day, and we don't realize it. And that's the way we like it. Right? We're not trying to take credit for all of that work. We want the commercial entities that are, you know, getting access to this technology and commercializing it to get all of the credit for the work that they did, because we don't typically create commercial products. Right? So, we will create the innovation and the intellectual property. And a lot of times our subject matter experts will help along the way as there's a need. But, yeah, there's some really great tech that's been pushed out into the world. And another good example is the solar refrigerator was another technology that was developed here at Johnson Space Center 20 plus years ago right where we decided to patent that technology. It was picked up by a commercial company. And they've been successfully selling solar refrigerators around the world as a means of improving transportation, of medical, you know, vaccines, or, you know, transplant organs, these types of things. So, you have access to power in a refrigerated box because it's solar, so you don't have to worry about plugging it in all the time. Same with developing countries, where they may not have a reliable power grid, you know, that you can plug your refrigerator in, a lot of us here in the United States don't think about the fact that you can plug your refrigerator in and put food in it. You don't have to worry about losing power. Your food's going to be good the next day.  Host: Yeah.  Kris Romig: And that's not true everywhere in the world. So, having a portable refrigerator device that is powered by the Sun essentially, you know, gives people food security, it gives them the opportunity to have access to a longer supply of food for their household that they wouldn't otherwise have. And it's independent of having industrial power grid that they can go plug into.  Host: Wow.  Kris Romig: And that was an invention that came here out of Johnson Space Center.  Host: Unbelievable. That’s, -- I'm trying to wrap my head around it, because I know one of the few things I know about refrigerators is it's one of those things in the household that consumes the greatest amount of energy.  Kris Romig: Right.  Host: So, making it energy efficient so that it runs entirely on solar, that's complicated.  Kris Romig: Yeah, it's a complicated technology. And, again, it's those types of things, as we're trying to figure out how do we keep astronauts safe on the space station, how do we keep them comfortable, you know, those very technologies, you know, we worry about efficiency, we're worried about power, we're worried about the mass and size of things. Right? Because we have to launch them into space. And so those very things often will go into the technologies and products that are developed here on Earth, because we're already solving a lot of the hard parts of it. Right? We have to be innovative to continue to push the boundaries of human spaceflight.  Host: Let's go into the details of what it takes to go from NASA technology to something that is now being licensed to a commercial company. Say someone comes to you with what they think is a novel idea, and they say, “hey, I'd like to get this patented”?  Kris Romig: Yeah, so, it's one of those things where if it's an internal inventor or innovator, they would come to us and say, I've been working on this technology, I think it's patentable. Right? I want to get it patented and get it out into the world. We have that happen frequently. Our inventors are very passionate about what they're working on. Right? And so, I won't talk about any specific technologies right now, because those tend to displace the potential for a patent award if it's in that process.  Host: Defeats the purpose. [Laughter]   Kris Romig: Right, you know, but we do have that. And so, what we'll do is we'll take it into the Tech Transfer Office, we'll evaluate what they've given us from a description perspective, we'll typically sit down with the patent council and review it. There's usually a lot of back and forth with the inventor, right, getting more information, looking at drawings, going and visiting the lab, really getting as smart as we can about the technology itself. And then on our side, we will do what's called a prior arch search. So, go out and look to see what other technologies that have already been patented might exist that are very similar. Right? We're basically looking to see what's the potential for it actually being awarded by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Right? And so, there's, -- a lot of understanding of patent law and things that would potentially be awarded or not awarded. So, we look for that upfront before we go and invest in those patent applications. And then we'll do what's called a commercial assessment or a market assessment of that technology. So, the best that we can, we'll go do some research, what particular industry might this technology be used in. So, in some cases, it might be communication technology, [Radio-frequency identification] RFID tags and sensors, and reader technology. So, we'll go look in those particular industries or sectors, see what the state-of-the-art technology is, see who's buying what, what's going on from a development perspective. And if we feel that we have a novel approach to solving a problem, that the terrestrial industry has, right, and we've done enough research, then sometimes we'll cold call companies. Are you even interested in this type of technology? If we patented this, would this be something you'd be interested in? Just to try to understand if we'd get some mark attraction on it. We'll take all of that and then we'll make a decision. Are we going to move forward with a patent or not? If we do, that patent process can take up to two years until it's finally awarded. So, there's some timing and strategy that goes into what gets patented. Some technologies are just overcome every six months, you know, technologies are doubling in certain industries. So, by the time you'd be awarded a patent, it'd be obsolete. Right?  Host: Yeah.  Kris Romig: And so, once a patent's been awarded, if a company comes in and says, hey, we're looking for a technology to solve this particular problem, we've gone to technology.nasa.gov, we've looked and seen that you have a technology that's available for licensing, we'd like to license that, that usually starts a series of conversations. Okay, what's the type of business that you have? What do you want to do with the technology? It's just us trying to go through a bit of an informal vetting process to make sure that if we have a license for this technology to this company, that they have the potential to do something with it. You know? So, there's sometimes folks that will have a great idea, but they haven't formed the company yet. Right? Or they don't have investors, or they don't have the engineering capacity to turn it into a product. And that's perfectly fine. We'll talk to everybody. Right? So, that’s there’s no exclusions there. But how we approach the licensing process may differ depending on who's coming to talk with us. Right? And so typically we'll go through some conversations if we feel that it's worth, you know, that license, that it would be in good hands to go push this technology forward from that private sector company. We'll sign a license agreement between NASA and that company. There's three different ways, three different licenses. One's called an evaluation license. It gives a company access for 12 months to play around with the technology, to work on prototypes, to just kind of get smart about it without a long-term commitment. And they can walk away at any time. If they want to follow on and create a commercial product for sale, they would have what's called a commercial license. Right? So, that gives them direct access to the patent itself, to then go off and sell a commercial product for the, you know, life of the patent. So, it might be up to 20 years that they could go off and have exclusive rights to that patent technology for their products. And then what we really have been trying to do in the last five or, so years is push the entrepreneurial side, the startup side, so we have a no fee, you know, very low barrier to entry, startup license agreement that a small startup company could come in and say they clearly don't have a lot of capital upfront. Right? So, it's a free, nonexclusive license that they can have access to the technology to go commercialize it for up to three years. And after that three-year period of time, there will be some small fees that would be introduced as they get to commercial viability. But what we ask from them is commercialization plans, give us your development plans, and we work with them on that. We just want to make sure that they're putting that thoughtfulness into how are you going to use this technology to make it a commercial product. We also will frequently work with economic development hubs around the country, you know, or incubator, investor, you know, ecosystems, to provide that intellectual property content to that startup ecosystem. Right? Where somebody else is figuring out the finances, somebody else is figuring out how to bring the right business management and technical team together to start a company, but maybe they don't have an idea or the technology that they want to go, you know, promote. And so, we can come in and help fill those gaps with a technology from NASA that says, look, here's 1,000 patents that NASA actively, you know, is pushing right now that is available to, you know, a community to go off and take advantage of. And we will frequently partner with the SBIR program that NASA has. So, a small business innovative research. So, it's a grant giving program. So, look at companies that can, you know, get NASA grants to mature and develop technologies, and then there are times where they will use a NASA technology, license it, get a NASA grant to mature that technology for a commercial product. And a lot of times, that grant program is to sponsor technologies that NASA would then be a customer of. Right? So, it's a little more complicated in the mechanics of it. But basically, we're doing everything we can to engage with small businesses and universities to use our technology, to give or provide grants to folks who need grant money to mature technologies. And then push out into the commercial sector. We want folks to take our technology and commercialize it, is the intent.  Host: And what I'm hearing on the back end for that, for that first part is even considering patents is not a small task. Someone comes to you with that idea, and you're sitting down and you're really thinking this through and making sure you have the best understanding of what the market is, what the potential is, before you even pursue this thing, but then when you have it, you really are trying the best ways to get it out into the public, whether it's a mature business, whether it's a startup, there's ways to do that, and really help boost. It's not just, it's not just a handout, like here it is, here's a patent, have fun.   Kris Romig: Right.  Host: You know? It's development. It's a process.  Kris Romig: That's exactly right. And it can be a complicated process if you're not, you know, intimately involved with it on a regular basis. We have a monthly cycle. So, every month, we will sit down with the patent council at the center. And there's a board of us, about 10 of us that sit around the table and look through every technology disclosure that's been provided to you are office and go through this process of determining whether or not it's worthy of pursuing more, you know, research to file a patent or not. Right? And so, it's very professional, we make sure that we're giving every technology and innovation that gets disclosed to us the same time and attention that it deserves. We were frequently going back to the inventors and talking with them for more information. But I like to consider that we are a service-oriented organization. Right? We're providing a service. Internally, we're the experts. We understand the nuts and bolts of how the machine works. But if you're an outside company or university that you want access to NASA technology, you want to understand how to partner with us, we are a good front door to just pick up the phone, contact us, have those conversations, and we can help guide you through that process. If you're a NASA innovator, right, and you're saying, “oh, I've invented this great thing, but I don't know what to do with it”, you know, pick up the phone, give us a call, we'll walk you through that process. You know, the things that we want to be very careful about is sometimes people get very excited about their technologies. Right? And they'll publish a conference paper and they'll put all the technical details out into the world. And in a way, that's wonderful, that's great, you're getting it out into the community. However, we've had several instances where that's happened, or there will be somebody took a video and put it on YouTube because they wanted to share this cool technology they developed. And that's like, well, that starts a clock now that we have to file for a patent in a very short period of time because you've now put it out into the public domain. Right? So, now anybody could go file a patent on that technology if they wanted to. Right? So, there's, there's some challenges there. And, but again, that's okay. You know? That's part of the service that we provide is never to scold folks. It's never to, you know, it's like just come talk with us, we'll do everything we can to make sure that the technologies are being protected appropriately, and that they're getting out into the world. That is our goal is make sure they get out in the world.  Host: That is true. It is, it is a there’s a lot of, I'm sure, very complicated nuances when it comes to U.S. patent law. And that's going to be a whole thing. But you're the ones that are going to guide them through that.  Kris Romig: That's exactly right. You know? And if we don't know the answers, we'll go connect with other experts around the agency that may have experience in a particular area that we haven't seen before. Software is another really big one. We go through an evaluation process with software. And, again, it's not to slow things down. It's not to prevent it from getting out into the public domain. But a lot of times, software or models and simulations get developed on top of third-party software that NASA has bought or licensed a software package for us to use. And then we'll build this great application on top of it. And then we want to give it out to the world. Well, there's some legal implications of taking a third party, you know, software that we've licensed and then giving it out for free. Right? So, we just check the boxes, go through it and make sure that we're not, you know, inadvertently breaking any laws, or going to irritate anybody who are partners with us that have said “hey, you know, you've bought this software from us, and you've just released it out into the world for free, that's not, you know, a custodian of our relationship.” So, there's some process to how we do things. But that's what we're here to do, is provide that service.  Host: Now, this is a one thing that came to mind is we keep saying, we keep saying world, we're going out into the world, which I'm sure it definitely does. But there's probably some limitations, some restrictions when it comes to keeping it within the United States. So, when it comes to transferring technologies, is it limited to just that? Is it just the United States companies?  Kris Romig: The easy answer would be yes. Right? That that is the primary motivation for tech transfer is to stimulate the economy, to help grow U.S. businesses, to help increase the technical capability of the nation. But it's not the only answer. Right? So, we do, in our software, we're able to get software if it's open source, you know, for public release, it can go anywhere in the world. Right? We really don't try to limit that. Which is, again, why we have to review it, because if there are constraints, like I said about the, you know, ballistic reentry, you know, trajectory software, certainly there are certain parties we want -- have, get them to have access to it.   Host: Yea.  Kris Romig: But if a university student doing research in that area, in the United States, wanted access to that software, we could make, you know, that available to them. The hardware technology side of things, it's twofold. One, we do allow for licensing of NASA developed technology into foreign companies. There is a couple things to consider. One is we only file patents in the United States. So, we're not filing international patents. So, they may not be protected in other countries as they would be in the United States. Typically, we want those companies to have some U.S. presence, some manufacturing presence, or production capability here in the United States. So, it's okay that their corporate headquarters is in Sweden. Right? But if they have a capability here in the United States, or they have a branch of that company here in the United States, you know, we can certainly talk about licensing deals there. So, it is possible to do that. I would say a lot of those are kind of case by case. Right? And sometimes it might be less of a pure tech transfer opportunity with a foreign company. And it may be more of a co-development partnership opportunity. Right? So, there's a lot of nuance sometimes to these relationships versus just a straight licensing deal. That's why I always recommend just call us, so we can have the conversations of what are you trying to do, what are you interested in, because a lot of times folks will just want to mature technologies for NASA and sell it back because they want to help us go to the Moon. Right? They want to help us solve those problems. Like, fantastic, that's what we want. Right? We have a lot of complex systems we need to figure out how to design and build.  Host: Help us! [Laughter]   Kris Romig: Right, help us, right? So, we certainly don't want to artificially turn any of those folks away. So, it's always worth having a conversation. And then folks from my office, myself directly, can put, you know, some guidance into that conversation. Which direction should we go? Is this a co-development partnership thing? Is this a licensing thing? Is it, oh, you just want software? Yeah, here's the paperwork, fill this out, we'll get it to you in a couple of weeks. Right?  Host: Yeah.  Kris Romig: But, yeah, so we're very much open to those, you know, the global side of things. But there are some caveats. Sometimes there's some sensitives that we just want to be thoughtful of.  Host: Which makes sense. Yeah, sure. I want to give people a sense of the scale of what we're talking about. We're talking about technology transfer. We've thrown out a couple of examples of different ways that we're transferring NASA technology. But I think when people think about NASA, the first thing they think of is spacecraft. They think about propulsion. They think about, you know, where's that patented light speed technology. You know? So, I want to dive into some of the areas that we have these different technologies, because there's a lot. If you go to your website, you would kind of categorize it into different industries. You did aeronautics, manufacturing, health, robotics, power and materials, electrical. I started listing them and then I got bored because there are so many.  Kris Romig: Yeah, there's 15 that we categorize for tech transfer. The Chief Technology Office, chief technologist of the agency also has a set of categories or taxonomies for the different technical domains for the agency. They don't exactly line up. But we try to align things up for tech transfer and how we engage with the outside world, not just how NASA talks to itself. Right? So, yeah, you hit a lot of it's, you know, aeronautics, you know, electrical, environmental sciences, health and medical instrumentation, manufacturing. And we categorize them that way for a lot of reasons. One, so we understand what industries to go target with a grouping of technology, so it's easily bundled. Right? If we're going to go to a manufacturing conference, then we want all of our out of manufacturing and advanced manufacturing technologies and material science stuff to go there. Right?  Host: Yeah. Not like a life sciences, like very detailed things. “Hey, manufacturing guys, here's our life sciences. They're like, I don't care.”  Kris Romig: That's exactly right. Yeah. And it gives us an opportunity to take the NASA lingo and jargon and how we communicate with ourselves technically and kind of, I don't want to say scrub it, but certainly evolve that to be more conversational for the outside world. You know? So, people, when we talk about environments internally, right, we may be talking about the habitable environment on the International Space Station to keep the crew alive.  Host: Oh, yeah.  Kris Romig: But if you go out into the world and you talk about environmental science, it's a completely different discipline. Right?  Host: Yes.  Kris Romig: And so, there's some knowledge of having to understand how to translate some of that language and lingo a little bit. So, yeah, if you go to any of the NASA websites, the technology.NASA.gov, or software.NASA.gov, or even spinoff.NASA.gov, there’s you’ll see these categories broken down. You can click on the links and it will have all the technologies or patents under those areas, you know, there. So, if you know you're only interested in aeronautics, right, you can go and drill down in that particular domain.  Host: So, yeah, what you're doing is you're categorizing things based on, because, again, the ultimate goal is they're going out, they're going outside of NASA. Maybe they're going to come back inside. We've talked about examples where they're going to develop and sell it back. But the idea is you want to categorize them into industries, because those are your targets.  Kris Romig: Yeah, typically. And the one that I think we haven't talked about as a program yet that has come up a number of times is that commercial space side of things. So, we will typically couch things as couch things as aeronautics or aerospace. But the commercial space sector is just a little bit different. Right? And it's evolving differently. And I think the way we look at our intellectual property as an agency is going to evolve over the next five or ten years so that way we can align with commercial space needs. You know? Some of the challenges there sometimes of starting a space company, it may take five, 10, 15 years before you are selling a product or being, you know, commercially viable.  Host: Oh, yeah.  Kris Romig: And so, we think about return on investments a little bit differently in the commercial sector, as we expect a commercial product out in three to five years. But that doesn't quite fit for commercial space. So, we're having to evolve how we're looking at the technologies and how we're partnering with those entities. But we're very willing to do that. And I would say another area that tech transfer does, and this is trying to communicate across the agency, so we literally get thousands of new technology reports across the agency every year, all the different field centers, and we build, you know, we have that stored in this giant repository of technology. We're really the only ones that have access to it in the Tech Transfer Program. And so, we're looking at creating publications and websites so that NASA engineers can better communicate with other NASA engineers and scientists the projects that they're working on. So, we're not solving the same problems twice. Or, you know, we're able to collaborate a little bit more effectively. And so, when we see ourselves as this giant repository of technology and intellectual property, we want to share it internally as much as we share it externally.  Host: Yeah, that's definitely important. Improves efficiency as well too.  Kris Romig: Yep.  Host: For those technology developments. You talked about whenever you're working with commercial companies, this sort of development, yes, it's not necessarily a handoff. There's this relationship. You talked about whenever they're developing, sometimes having people intimately involved with the development process from NASA.  Kris Romig: That’s right.  Host: Is that -- how is that true? How does that work? Do we station them over with the commercial company? What's the relationship like?  Kris Romig: It depends. I'd say it's case by case. You know? It depends on what the company is bringing to the table. So, if they are a mature engineering or manufacturing company, they may need less of our help. So, a couple of phone calls once in a while with the inventor is sufficient, because they have a team of technical folks and manufacturing people to go solve the problems that they have. In the case of a small startup or smaller companies, we may get a little bit more integrated with that technical team. Some of it is just dependability on the NASA inventor. Right? So, I don't have authority to obligate my inventor's time to go help, you know, make a commercial product. There may be the drive and the passion by the inventors to do that. Right? But then usually there's a conversation with that person's management with that technical inventor, our office, and try to figure out, how can we get them access to the resources to pay for some of that person's time if it's during work hours, you know, to go participate. There is other things called space act agreements. Right? So, we can have separate partnership agreements with those same companies where the license might be the seed corn. Right? But then that space act agreement can list out a number of different ways that both parties will benefit from the relationship. So, they may go mature a technology that NASA wants to see -- that we'd love to see the data. Hey, great, we stopped funding this two years ago. If you're going to keep maturing it, we'd love to see your results. You know? And in exchange for that, we can, you know, provide you access to some of our special lab space or some of our subject matter experts who develop that technology can be available to help you through things. Typically, we want to get the commercial entity any list of materials that were used, access to prototypes, designs, analysis, that type of stuff can get bundled up and packaged. So, there's more than just a legal agreement that says you can now use this patent, right, to go mature something. A lot of times that's not sufficient to go do the engineering and design work you need to do to create a commercial product. So, there will need to be an exchange of other information, you know, design details, analysis models, test results, those types of things. And a lot of that is done, you know, one on one between the inventors and, you know, the technical point of contact, -- in the commercial company.  Host: And one of the main things I'm getting out of this, as you're going through the intricate process of what it takes to actually transfer a NASA technology, is that communication is key, and keeping them, keeping all these companies informed, keeping the NASA community informed that this is a thing, and we can help you with this process. And like that's, it seems like that's the majority of your job is just, is walking people through this process of making sure that you're developing the technologies, that it's in a good and efficient way, and that people know what's going on.  Kris Romig: Yeah, absolutely. I would say the top two things, communication and relationships. Right? So, that's the thing that we push. That's why I talked about us being a service-oriented organization. We're a service provider. If we're doing our jobs, right, the process and mechanization and the back end should be almost invisible to the outside stakeholders or our internal stakeholders. Right? But what they see is a group or a team of folks that are present, willing to help, you know, that we're answering the phone, we're responding to the emails, and we're getting engaged. We do have a small team, so sometimes there's a lag in comm, simply because we're off running down a bunch of different rabbit holes simultaneously. So, there's some things internally that I wish we had just more folks engaged so we can be doing a little better job. But we do the best we can with what we have. And it's very important for us to, and this is something we're continuing to evolve here at JSC, is to recognize and acknowledge the inventors and innovators at Johnson Space Center. Right? So, if you get a patent awarded, you'll get a patent plaque, and part of the JSC honor ceremony and things, which is great. But, you know, that's, like I said, 5, 6 percent of the disclosures that come to the office. So, it's not a lot. So, we're constantly looking for ways of how do we show our appreciation to the innovative community of Johnson Space Center that are submitting disclosures to us, that are picking up the phone and saying, hey, I've got this cool idea, I don't know what to do with it. Right? So, we're looking for ways to make sure that we're staying connected and we're providing that service to them.  Host: Yeah, that's the key, I think. And I was definitely, it was hitting home when you were talking about a small team. Man, I like, I think that's something that everybody wishes. Man, if we only had more people, but, yeah, we're all just trying, we all have multiple hats to try to get the job done.  Kris Romig: It's the way it goes. And we all understand that. There's about, you know, eight or nine of us over in tech transfer that are doing a bunch of different things.  Host: Eight or nine doing all this? [Laughter]  Kris Romig: Yeah, well, and at the patent council, there's about two more. Right? So, that's inclusive. So, ten. So, say ten folks, ten, 11 folks that are doing this on a regular basis. Yeah, it's, and it's a lot. When you talk about hundreds of new disclosures coming in and patent filings and license agreements. But I can say honestly every person that works on my team is passionate about what they do. Right? They're passionate about seeing that NASA technology get out into the world. And if you've got that, then everything else will work itself out. Right? And that's, and we're constantly looking for ways to improve our processes, to improve how we're communicating, and so we're very open to feedback. Right? I want to know what's not working for any of our stakeholders, either external to the agency or here at Johnson Space Center. Just tell us. Right? And preferably politely. But tell us, you know, what's not quite working for you, and we'll adjust, because we're here to serve.  Host: When you go out to these conferences, and when you're communicating about this, this effort, this technology transfer effort, what are some of the big highlights that you like to tout, like when it comes to NASA technology, that's in everybody's lives, that's in, that's actually, that's helping the economy develop, what are some of the examples of technologies that you really like to highlight?  Kris Romig: Well, I think I've already touched on the ones really that I push from JSC. Right? Which is like the inflatable habitat technology, you know, the solar refrigerator. The winglet one is just one that I happened to remember. I think it was mostly Glenn Research and Langley Research Centers that were doing that technology back in the day. Those tend to be the big ones that we push and promote. There's a lot going on in RFID right now, water cleanup technologies, as far as NASA's actively investing in them here at Johnson Space Center. And those are the ones that are getting the most attention. Battery technology developments, those were, you know, if we're looking at various electric vehicles and batteries, you know, energy storage and batteries, and how do you make them more efficient, how do you make them lightweight, how do you prevent them from catching on fire and blowing up? And we've all heard stories about cell phones, you know, that spontaneously combust, and people getting injured. And so, we have --  Host: Yeah, energy stories, huge.  Kris Romig: -- Energy stories is huge. Right? And so we have a group here at Johnson Space Center that that's their sole focus is making sure that the, you know, energy storage systems that are going onto the space station and the spacecraft, you know, for human spaceflight, that those batteries are safe, that they can operate in and around crew members on a regular basis, they can be charged and discharged on a regular, you know, safely. And so those technologies tend to be the ones that we're pushing a lot. And so that's the ones that we'll talk about. Hey, this is where we're going, these are the problems we're trying to solve internally. And they just happen to line up with what's going on, you know, terrestrially here, water cleanup technology is, like I said before, is another big one. Right?  Host: Yeah.  Kris Romig: So, those are the ones that we tend to push. And, you know, one of the advantages that we talk about is, like I said, is we're not trying to make money off of this technology. Right? That's never the premise that we're trying to get out there. So, we'll frequently talk about just free access to the tech, free access to, you know, licenses, and the software and things like that.  Host: Wow. So, you mentioned this a little bit earlier on. But I wanted to lock onto commercial space. You said in terms of, it seems like you've had to kind of adjust the way, even when you're talking to different groups, how you talk to different groups changes. But the idea of commercial space is going to be almost an entirely new way of conducting business in a sense because of, because of its scale and its relevance to the technologies that we're building. So, what excites you for that phase of technology transfer? And what are some of the challenges? I mean, it sounds like one of the challenges is timelines is going to be one of the challenges. But what's coming up? What do we have to look forward to?  Kris Romig: Yeah, so, I mean, the things that excite me about that is a lot of the technologies especially developed here at Johnson Space Center can be challenged to convert to terrestrial commercial markets. Right? Because there's a big leap between a technology that was developed for the International Space Station that's supposed to be small, lightweight, you know, safe to operate in space, doesn't always translate directly to a commercial product here on Earth.  Host: Yeah.  Kris Romig: So, when we start talking about commercial space, now suddenly it's like, well, this is a one to one transfer of technology. They're going to want to use it in a very similar application to what we designed it for. Right? So, I think there's going to be quite a bit of renewed interest in this surge of interest in licensing our technologies. If, my team can, you know, pick the right tech to patent and get out in the right ways over the next five years, I think we're going to see a lot more interest from the commercial sector to say, yeah, you know, sample like the inflatable habitat technology is being used in the same application with which we originally intended it. Right?  Host: Yeah.  Kris Romig: So, it's a very easy direct connect. And I think we'll see a lot more of that, especially coming out of JSC in the future, when we start talking about EVA tools, you know, going back to the Moon, right, what type of tools are we going to use on the lunar surface, what type of habitat technologies, EVA suits, you know, Rover wheels, all these types of things where there's usually a translation between space application and Earth application, now it will be commercial companies are going to use that same Rover on the lunar surface. But for a commercial purpose. So, they can directly translate to their needs. The challenge is obviously that the timeline, the viability of those companies’ long term as investments come and go, right, aerospace has always been a challenging business environment to get into. And so is that starting to blossom in what we're calling commercial space, you know, getting access to funds is going to be a big deal, and they're getting more and more of it. But, again, as we start looking at what companies are we going to license those technologies to, we have got to adjust internally our expectations of a commercial space entity's ability to commercialize, to raise capital, those types of things. And so, there's an adjustment that we need to make.  Host: Yeah.  Kris Romig: And our eyes are open. Right? So, we're making those adjustments incrementally.  Host: That's exciting. I mean, that's a whole different way of doing spaceflight, just in general. That's just a, the fact that that's a landscape that we have to consider and adjust for just shows kind of how far we've come.  Kris Romig: Yeah, it's a very exciting time to be in tech transfer. Right? Because normally we're just trying to figure out how to make things usable here. But now to go, well, gosh, we're going back to the Moon, you know, people want to mine the Moon for oxygen and hydrogen and water and create this lunar economy, and a lot of the technologies that are getting developed at different NASA centers will help in that.  Host: Yeah.  Kris Romig: Right? And so that's just, it's compelling. You know?  Host: Yeah, wonderful. What a fascinating landscape. At the very end here, we're going to throw some of those links you talked about.  Kris Romig: Okay, perfect.  Host: And so, we can promote this and say, hey, here's where you can go for all of this information. Kris, I really appreciate your time coming on and going through all the details of tech transfer.  Kris Romig: Yeah, thank you so much. I appreciate being here.  [ Music ]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. Fascinating conversation we had today with Kris Romig about Technology Transfer and all of that great NASA technology that ends up in our lives. If you want to listen to more podcasts about some of the technology that's in the space world that might end up being in your life, go to nasa.gov/podcast to listen to our podcast and the many others all across NASA of all of the activities that are going on across the agency.

        description: ">> HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST. WELCOME TO THE OFFICIAL PODCAST OF THE NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER EPISODE 14: ROBOTIC ARMS IN SPACE. I’M GARY JORDAN AND I’LL BE YOUR HOST TODAY. SO IF YOU’RE NEW TO THE SHOW, THIS IS WHERE WE BRING IN NASA EXPERTS-- SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, ASTRONAUTS-- ALL TO TELL YOU THE COOLEST STUFF ABOUT WHAT’S GOING ON HERE AT NASA. SO TODAY WE’RE TALKING WITH TIM BRAITHWAITE. HE’S THE CANADIAN SPACE AGENCY’S LIAISON MANAGER HERE AT THE NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER IN HOUSTON, TEXAS. AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE ROBOTIC ARMS IN SPACE, WHICH IS PERFECT BECAUSE ASTRONAUTS ABOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION ARE GOING TO PERFORM THREE SPACEWALKS IN THE MONTH OF OCTOBER. AND IN ALL THREE THE ASTRONAUTS ARE WORKING ON THE CANADARM2, WHICH WE’LL BE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS EPISODE, ALONG WITH HOW IT WAS DEVELOPED AND HOW IT WORKS TODAY, HOW THE TECHNOLOGY HELPS PEOPLE HERE ON EARTH, AND WHAT’S COMING UP IN THE FUTURE. BUT FOR A LOT OF EPISODES, WE TIE TOPICS TO WHAT’S GOING ON TODAY HERE IN SPACE, AND TRY TO EXPLAIN IT AT A HIGH LEVEL. WE’RE ALWAYS LISTENING TO WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT, AND WE’RE LOOKING ON SOCIAL MEDIA ESPECIALLY. SO IF YOU’VE LISTENED TO PREVIOUS EPISODES, WE TELL YOU WHERE TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS SO WE CAN PUT IT IN THE PODCAST AT THE END OF EVERY EPISODE. SO I WANTED TO ANSWER THIS TWITTER QUESTION FROM JENNIFER, WHO ASKED AFTER THE MISSION CONTROL EPISODE, “WHEN YOU RUN AN EXPERIMENT, ARE SCIENTISTS INVITED TO THE MISSION CONTROL CENTER?” SO I WENT AND DID SOME DIGGING AND FOUND OUT THAT SOMETIMES THEY COME TO MISSION CONTROL HOUSTON, BUT A LOT OF THE TIMES THEY’RE PATCHED THROUGH FROM THE PAYLOAD OPERATIONS INTEGRATION CENTER AT MARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT CENTER IN HUNTSVILLE, ALABAMA. THEY’RE PATCHED ALL THE WAY UP TO THE ASTRONAUTS ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. OTHERWISE THEY CAN BE PATCHED THROUGH FROM A REMOTE LOCATION, AND THEY SORT OF HELP WALK THE ASTRONAUTS THROUGH SOME OF THEIR TASKS, AND SOMETIMES THEY CAN JUST KIND OF WATCH AND MONITOR AS THEY’RE DOING IT. SO ANYWAY, TODAY WE’RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT ROBOTIC ARMS IN SPACE WITH MR. TIM BRAITHWAITE. SO WITH NO FURTHER DELAY, LET’S GO LIGHT SPEED AND JUMP RIGHT AHEAD TO THAT TALK. ENJOY. [ MUSIC ] >> T MINUS FIVE SECONDS AND COUNTING-- MARK. [ INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ] >> HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST. [ MUSIC ] >> SO THANKS FOR COMING ON, AND I KNOW IT’S BEEN PARTICULARLY BUSY RECENTLY, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IN THE MONTH OF OCTOBER WE HAVE A FEW SPACEWALKS GOING OUT THAT ARE PARTICULARLY FOCUSING ON ROBOTIC ARMS, RIGHT, SPECIFICALLY THE CANADARM2? >> EXACTLY. THIS FIRST SPACEWALK ESPECIALLY, ON THURSDAY THE 5th IS PRETTY MUCH ENTIRELY DEDICATED TO REPLACING ONE OF OUR TWO LATCHING END EFFECTORS ON CANADARM2. >> OKAY, AND WHAT’S A LATCHING END EFFECTOR? >> THE ARM IS MORE OR LESS SYMMETRICAL, AND AT EACH END YOU KIND OF CALL IT THE WORKING HAND OF THE ARM. >> OH, OKAY. >> --IS WHAT YOU CALL THE LATCHING END EFFECTOR. WE USUALLY CALL IT A LEE-- L-E-E. >> OKAY, LOTS OF ACRONYMS HERE. >> IT’S NOT A HAND IN THE SENSE THAT IT HAS FINGERS, BUT THERE ARE GRASPING, GRAPPLING AND LATCHING MECHANISMS THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO CAPTURE A FREEFLYING CARGO VEHICLE IN SPACE, OR STEP ONTO ANOTHER MODULE ON THE SPACE STATION AND MAKE THAT THE NEW OPERATING BASE, THEN RELEASE THE OTHER END AND THE ARM CAN WALK END OVER END. >> OH. >> BUT THE LATCHING END EFFECTOR PACKAGE IS A BIG THING-- IT’S A SORT OF CYLINDER A LITTLE OVER A METER LONG, WEIGHS OVER 200 KILOGRAMS. >> WOW. >> SO IT’S A BIG PACKAGE. THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS WITH GEAR TRAINS OF THEIR OWN, LOTS OF ONBOARD ELECTRONICS, WHAT WE CALL A FORCE END MOMENT SENSOR. SO WHEN THAT LEE IS THE TIP OF THE ARM, IT CAN ACTUALLY SENSE HOW HARD IT’S PUSHING AGAINST SOMETHING OR HOW HARD SOMETHING IS PUSHING BACK. AND THAT’S VERY USEFUL IF WE ARE INSERTING A BIG ITEM, LIKE THE JAPANESE CARGO VEHICLE HAS AN EXTERNAL PALLET THAT WE EXTRACT AND THEN REINSERT LIKE A DRAWER INTO A CHEST OF DRAWERS. AND IMAGINE IF YOU’RE DOING THAT AT HOME, BEING ABLE TO FEEL HOW YOU’RE LINED UP AND FEEL THE FORCES ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER. THAT’S A VERY USEFUL THING TO GETTING THE DRAWER ALL THE WAY IN SUCCESSFULLY. >> RIGHT. >> AND THE SAME SORT OF PRINCIPLES APPLY WITH CANADARM2-- THAT FORCE END MOMENT SENSOR CAPABILITY IS VERY USEFUL. BUT THAT’S ALL PART OF THAT BIG, PRETTY COMPLEX PACKAGE IN THE CANADARM2 LEEs. >> OKAY, SO LATCHING END EFFECTOR. AND WE CAN GET INTO SOME OF THE MORE SPECIFIC THINGS LATER HERE, AND JUST FOCUSING ON HOW THAT WORKS AND WHAT IT CAN GRAB. BUT I REALLY WANTED TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION TODAY BECAUSE OF THIS, RIGHT-- YOU KNOW, WE’RE REPLACING A LATCHING END EFFECTOR, AND WE HAVE SOME REGULAR MAINTENANCE, TOO, COMING UP WITH SOME OF THE OTHER SPACEWALKS. BUT REALLY, THIS KIND OF BEGS THE QUESTION FOR JUST A ROBOTIC ARM, THE IDEA OF A ROBOTIC ARM IN SPACE. SO IF YOU COULD KIND OF GIVE LIKE A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF WHAT A ROBOTIC ARM IN SPACE DOES-- BECAUSE IT IS SIGNIFICANT. >> THE ROBOTIC ARMS DO A LOT OF THINGS. AND OFTEN, THINGS-- HONESTLY-- THAT YOU DIDN’T NECESSARILY ANTICIPATE. SO GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM, WHEN NASA WAS PLANNING OUT ITS SPACE SHUTTLE BACK IN THE ‘70s. >> YEAH. >> THEY STARTED A DIALOGUE WITH THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT. THIS WAS ACTUALLY BEFORE THE CANADIAN SPACE AGENCY EXISTED. BACK THEN IT WAS THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA. >> OH. >> AND THEY STARTED A DIALOGUE, AND BY SORT OF THE MID 1970s HAD AN AGREEMENT GOING FORWARD THAT CANADA WOULD PROVIDE WHAT WE CALLED A REMOTE MANIPULATOR SYSTEM. AND THAT’S THE ROBOTIC ARM, THAT FAMILIAR ARM THAT YOU SEE IN ALL THOSE PICTURES OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE. >> YEAH. >> AND THE FIRST CANADARM, AS WE CALLED IT IN CANADA, FLEW ON STS-2. >> ON THE SPACE SHUTTLE? >> ON THE VERY SECOND FLIGHT THAT THEY FLEW AN ARM ON THAT-- THERE WASN’T AN ARM ON EVERY SINGLE SPACE SHUTTLE FLIGHT. THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE THERE WAS, AND THEY DEPLOYED IT AND SHIPPED IT OUT AND STARTED LEARNING WHAT AN ARM COULD DO FOR YOU.  THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT WAS THAT THEY MIGHT DEPLOY SATELLITES OUT OF THE PAYLOAD BAY, CATCH SATELLITES AND SERVICE THEM OR BRING THEM BACK TO EARTH. BUT WHAT WE SAY OVER THOSE FIRST YEARS OF OPERATION WITH THE SPACE SHUTTLE WAS THAT THEY WERE THINKING OF THINGS THAT THEY HADN’T ANTICIPATED. I REMEMBER ONE CASE IN PARTICULAR-- THE SPACE SHUTTLE SOMETIMES VENTED FLUIDS OUT THE SIDES-- THEY JUST VENTED STUFF OVERBOARD. AND ONE TIME, THE VENT WASN’T WORKING QUITE RIGHT AND AN ICICLE GREW OUT OF THE SIDE OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE. >> OOH. >> AND THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT-- IT MIGHT BREAK OFF DURING REENTRY, MIGHT BE A PROBLEM. >> YEAH. >> SO THEY PLANNED THIS OPERATION NO ONE EVER IMAGINED THAT THEY WOULD KNOCK THE ICICLE OFF WITH THE ROBOTIC ARM. >> NO WAY! >> AND THAT WAS ONE OF MANY-- AND THERE WERE OTHER THINGS, TOO-- TRYING TO THROW A SWITCH ON THE OUTSIDE OF A ROTATING SATELLITE USING THE ARM. JUST THINGS YOU HADN’T THOUGHT OF, AND THAT’S THE GREAT POTENTIAL FOR FLEXIBILITY THAT THIS SORT OF ROBOTIC ARM CAN GIVE YOU. YOU HAVE A CAPABILITY TO GO LOOK AT THINGS UP CLOSE BECAUSE THERE’S A CAMERA ON THE END. >> OH, OKAY. >> YOU-- I MEAN, DURING THE COURSE OF THE SPACE STATION PROGRAM, YEARS LATER, WE STARTED CAPTURING FREEFLYING CARGO VEHICLES. THE VERY FIRST ONE WAS THE JAPANESE CARGO VEHICLE, HTV-1. I THINK THAT WAS IN 2009. >> OKAY. >> AND THAT WAS YEARS AFTER THE ARM ARRIVED ON SPACE STATION BACK IN 2001. AND ALL THIS WORK-- AND ACTUALLY, SOME EXPANSION CAPABILITY OF THE ARM TO SATISFY ALL THE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS SO WE COULD DO THAT-- YOU HAVE THIS BIG SPACECRAFT GENTLY FLY UP UNDER THE SPACE STATION AND SIT THERE, AND THE ARM WOULD REACH OUT AND SECURELY GRASP IT AND THEN ATTACH IT TO THE SPACE STATION. I MEAN, THAT’S-- AGAIN, PART OF THAT EXPANDING CAPABILITY THAT’S BEEN SO NEAT. >> YEAH. I MEAN, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE HUMAN ARM, RIGHT, YOU THINK ABOUT JUST THE FACT THAT IT’S GOT THAT JOINT-- AND THEN AT THE TIP OF IT IS THE HAND. AND THE HAND IS NOT MEANT FOR JUST ONE TASK, RIGHT, THE HAND IS MEANT TO DO A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND KIND OF MANIPULATE. WAS THERE SOME SORT OF ENGINEERING THAT WENT INTO THE HAND OR THE ROBOTIC ARM THAT SORT OF EMULATES THAT OF A HAND TO BE AS FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE WITH ALL THESE TASKS HERE THAT YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT? >> WELL, JUST AS WITH A HUMAN ARM, WE CAN MAKE OURSELVES TOOLS THAT WE WOULD GO USE. >> YEAH. >> WE HAVE THE SAME CAPABILITY TO GO DO THAT WITH ROBOTICS. FOR THE CANADARM2 END EFFECTOR, WHICH IS QUITE SIMILAR TO IT-- IT’S EVOLVED FROM THAT ORIGINAL SHUTTLE ARM END EFFECTOR-- IT WAS DESIGNED IN PARTICULAR TO BE ABLE TO RELEASE A SATELLITE, TO DEPLOY IT IN SPACE, AND NOT LEAVE ANY RESIDUAL RATES ON IT. IT HAD TO BE ABLE TO LET IT GO AND NOT HAVE IT BE MOVING OR TUMBLING OR ANYTHING. IT HAD TO LET IT GO AND IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY STILL, AND THEY COULD BACK AWAY WITHOUT ANY RATES ON IT SO THAT THE MECHANISMS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE-- WE HAVE THESE STEEL CABLES WHICH WE CALL SNARE CABLES. >> YEAH. >> AND THAT WHOLE ASSEMBLY IS DESIGNED TO BE ABLE TO LET IT GO AND HAVE IT BE PERFECTLY STILL. SO THAT WAS THE BASIS OF THAT. >> OKAY. >> BUT FOR SPACE STATION, THE PROPER NAME OF OUR WHOLE SYSTEM, THE WHOLE SUITE OF ROBOTICS, IS ACTUALLY THE MOBILE SERVICING SYSTEM. WE ARE THERE-- THESE CANADIAN ROBOTS ARE HERE TO SERVICE THE SPACE STATION. WE’RE HERE TO DO MAINTENANCE. >> OH! >> SO BEYOND JUST THE CANADARM2-- WHICH IS A BIG ARM, DOES A LOT OF HEAVY LIFTING-- IT CAN MOVE REMARKABLY LARGE, MASSIVE OBJECTS-- WE ALSO BUILT A TWO-ARMED MAINTENANCE ROBOT WHICH WE CALL DEXTRE. IT’S THE SPECIAL PURPOSE DEXTROUS MANIPULATOR, BUT WE CALL IT DEXTRE. >> SURE. >> IT LOOKS-- IT’S GOT TWO ARMS. IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE A GUY, BUT IT’S ACTUALLY REALLY BIG. BUT THESE DEXTROUS ARMS, WHICH HAVE A SMALLER AND DIFFERENT KIND OF END EFFECTOR ON THOSE SMALLER ARMS, THEY’RE ABLE TO DO MORE DEXTROUS TASKS, MORE REFINED-- WE CAN REPLACE SMALL ELECTRONIC BOXES ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE SPACE STATION. WE’VE DONE THAT A FEW TIMES NOW WITH POWER CONTROLLER MODULES THAT NEED TO BE REPLACED. >> MM-HMM. >> OTHER BOXES WHICH WERE DESIGNED FOR ROBOTIC MAINTENANCE. THE INTERFACES ON THESE BOXES MUST MATCH THE DESIGN OF THE HAND THAT THESE END EFFECTORS, WHETHER ON DEXTRE OR ON CANADARM2. BUT IF IT’S DESIGNED FOR THAT-- AND WE’VE DEMONSTRATED WE CAN DO A LOT OF REALLY COOL MAINTENANCE THAT RELIEVES THE SPACE STATION CREW FROM HAVING TO GO OUTSIDE AND DO SPACEWALKS, WHICH ARE VERY COOL, BUT THEY TAKE A LOT OF TIME. >> RIGHT. >> AND THAT ALLOWS-- FREES THEM UP TO STAY INSIDE AND DO SCIENCE AND RESEARCH, DO ALL THAT GREAT STUFF. >> ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, THE WHOLE BENEFIT OF SENDING HUMANS OUT TO DO SPACEWALKS IS-- YOU KNOW, FIRST OF ALL, THEY CAN MAKE DECISIONS REAL TIME, AND IT’S REAL QUICK ON WHAT THEY CAN DO. BUT THEY HAVE HANDS-- THEY CAN USE TOOLS, AND THOSE TOOLS ARE MEANT TO OPERATE AND FIX THINGS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE STATION, BUT YOU’RE SAYING THAT DEXTRE, IN A WAY, AT THE END OF THE CANADARM2 CAN ACCOMPLISH A LOT OF THOSE TASKS AND THEN DO SOME OF THE SERVICE WORK THAT THE ASTRONAUTS WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TO DO. >> RIGHT. I MEAN, DEXTRE IN ONE SENSE IS A TOOL. >> HMM. >> THE ROBOTS THEMSELVES, THEY ARE NOT THINKING FOR THEMSELVES. WE CAN’T-- WE’RE NOT YET AT THE POINT WHERE WE CAN TELL IT, “GO CHANGE OUT THAT BOX,” AND IT GOES AND DOES IT ON ITS OWN. >> AS COOL AS THAT WOULD BE. >> AS COOL AS THAT WILL BE, AND THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN THAT WILL BE. HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT THERE YET. >> OKAY. >> WHEN WE STARTED OUT, WHEN WE FIRST LAUNCHED THE ARM, JUST LIKE THE SHUTTLE ARM, ON SPACE STATION, WE HAD A SYSTEM THAT HAD TO BE OPERATED BY THE CREW ON ORBIT. AND THERE IS WHAT WE CALL THE ROBOTICS WORKSTATION-- ONE IN THE LAB MODULE, ONE IN THE CUPOLA WHERE ALL THE WINDOWS ARE. >> MM-HMM. >> AND THE ASTRONAUTS CAN BE THERE, AND THEY CAN OPERATE THE ARM. AND THEY HAVE HAND CONTROLLERS, AND THEY THROW THE SWITCHES, AND THEY HAVE MONITORS THAT SHOW THE CAMERA VIEWS FROM CAMERAS ON THE ARM, CAMERAS ELSEWHERE ON THE STATION. AND WHAT WE REALIZED ACTUALLY AFTER THE ARM WAS FLOWN WAS THAT AS MUCH WORK AS WE DO ON SPACE STATION, WE COULD DO THIS FROM THE GROUND-- WE COULD REMOTELY OPERATE THESE ROBOTS SAFELY FROM THE GROUND. AND DURING THE COURSE OF SPACE STATION ASSEMBLY-- AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENTS, ESPECIALLY MOSTLY FOR CANADARM2, WAS ASSEMBLY OF THE SPACE STATION. THERE WERE VERY FEW PIECES OF-- BIG PIECES ON THE U.S. SEGMENT OF THE SPACE STATION, WHETHER MODULES OR BIG PIECES OF TRUSS, THAT WEREN’T HANDLED BY CANADARM2. >> WOW. >> YEAH, I MEAN, WHETHER-- I MEAN, OFTEN THE SHUTTLE ARM HAD TO TAKE THESE THINGS OUT OF THE PAYLOAD BAY OF THE SHUTTLE WHEN IT CAME UP, HAND IT OFF TO CANADARM2, AND THEY WOULD THEN BE INSTALLED. AND THE STATION WAS BUILT UP IN THAT WAY. SO CANADARM2 IN A VERY REAL SENSE ASSEMBLED THE SPACE STATION. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> BUT ONCE WE GOT PAST THAT, WE REALIZED WE CAN DO A LOT OF THIS WORK BY REMOTELY OPERATING THIS SYSTEM FROM THE GROUND, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE OPERATE DEXTRE. IF WE’RE GOING TO GO DO MAINTENANCE-- ONE OF THOSE POWER CONTROL MODULE REPLACEMENTS-- DOING IT ROBOTICALLY CAN TAKE ACTUALLY QUITE A LONG TIME. ALL THE END TO END WORK, GETTING THE SPARE, GETTING TO THE WORKSITE. >> YEAH. >> PULLING THE OLD ONE OUT, PUTTING THE NEW ONE IN-- THAT CAN ACTUALLY TAKE A COUPLE DAYS EVEN, IN A LONG, COMPLEX CASE. AND THE ASTRONAUTS ONBOARD ARE TOO BUSY FOR THAT. >> YEAH. >> SO WE FIGURED-- WE WENT THROUGH THIS LONG PROCESS, A LOT OF IT DEALING WITH THE SAFETY PROCESSES, MAKING SURE WE HAD WHAT WE CALL ENOUGH FAULT TOLERANCE THAT NO ONE FAILURE COULD REALLY LEAVE US IN TROUBLE DURING THE COURSE OF THIS-- AND ESTABLISHED WHAT WE CALLED GROUND CONTROL. AND IN FACT, TODAY, MOST OF THE ROBOTICS WORK THAT GOES ON ON SPACE STATION IS DONE CONTROLLING OUR ROBOTS FROM THE GROUND-- WHETHER HERE AT MISSION CONTROL IN HOUSTON, OR WE HAVE A SUPPORT CONTROL CENTER IN MONTREAL IN CANADA THAT CONNECTS HERE TO MISSION CONTROL, AND THAT ONE UNIFIED CANADIAN/AMERICAN TEAM OPERATES THE ARM FROM THE GROUND. >> WOW. >> AND THAT’S A TREMENDOUS TIME SAVING FOR THE ASTRONAUT CREW, BUT ALSO AN AMAZING ENHANCEMENT FOR THE WHOLE PROGRAM, BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO JUST DO SO MUCH MORE THAN WE OTHERWISE WOULD. >> SO WHEN IT FIRST-- YOU MENTIONED WHEN IT FIRST LAUNCHED, THE CANADARM2 TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, IT WAS WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH SHUTTLE ARMS, RIGHT? YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT A HAND-OFF. THAT WAS ALL OPERATED BY ASTRONAUTS, BOTH THE SHUTTLE ARM AND THE CANADARM2 FROM THE SPACE STATION? >> ABSOLUTELY, AND AT THAT TIME, WE HAD TWO FLIGHT CONTROL TEAMS, BECAUSE WE HAD THE SPACE SHUTTLE ROBOTIC ARM FLIGHT CONTROLLERS-- AND ALTHOUGH IT’S ALSO A BIG WHITE ARM THAT SAYS CANADA ON THE SIDE, IT’S ACTUALLY QUITE A DIFFERENT SYSTEM UNDER THE SKIN, SO WE HAD THOSE GUYS, THOSE FLIGHT CONTROLLERS WHO BUILT THOSE PROCEDURES, WORK WITH THE SHUTTLE ASTRONAUTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PROCEDURE WOULD GO JUST RIGHT. AND THEN ON THE SPACE STATION SIDE, WE BUILT THE PROCEDURES FOR OUR SYSTEM, WORKED WITH THAT CREW AND ORCHESTRATED WHAT WERE SOMETIMES FAIRLY COMPLEX HAND-OFF OPERATIONS. >> HUH. YEAH, I MEAN, YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT IN SPACE, TRAVELLING AROUND THE EARTH AT 17,500 MILES AN HOUR, TWO SHIPS PRETTY MUCH TRAVELLING THAT FAST TOGETHER AND HANDING OFF STUFF TO EACH OTHER. >> IT’S-- THE COMPLEXITY OF-- ESPECIALLY DURING THOSE SPACE SHUTTLE MISSIONS, THE WHOLE DAY WAS TIMELINED SO TIGHTLY THAT EVERYTHING HAD TO GO JUST RIGHT. AND WE’VE GOT, IN THOSE CASES-- AND THIS IS WHAT I USED TO DO. WHEN I FIRST CAME TO HOUSTON, I WAS WORKING ON THE SPACE STATION ROBOTICS FLIGHT CONTROL SIDE. I WAS WHAT THEY CALLED A ROBO. THAT WAS THE NAME OF OUR-- THE FLIGHT CONTROL DISCIPLINE. >> AND YOU WERE IN CHARGE OF THE CANADARM2? >> RIGHT. >> OKAY. >> AND WE HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE TWO BIG ROBOTIC ARMS-- WELL, FIRST AND FOREMOST, NEVER BUMPED INTO ANYTHING, INCLUDING EACH OTHER. SO YOU KNOW, MONITORING THE VOLUMES THAT THEY’RE WORKING IN, MAYBE MAKING SURE THAT WHILE ONE OF THEM’S MOVING THE OTHER ONE’S NOT-- ALL OF THE STEPS THAT YOU WOULD LOGICALLY TAKE JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE ALL THE MOVING PIECES ARE. >> YEAH. >> AND A HAND-OFF, SOMETHING THAT YOU AND I WOULD DO TRIVIALLY SITTING HERE HANDING A PEN FROM ONE ARM TO THE OTHER. >> MM-HMM. >> AGAIN, EVERYTHING’S MORE COMPLICATED WHEN YOU’RE DOING IT WITH SPACE ROBOTS. >> YOU’RE DOING IT FROM FAR AWAY, IN SPACE, SEVERAL ROBOTS, SEVERAL TEAMS. >> RIGHT, AND ALSO, THE-- WE DON’T EVEN THINK ABOUT THE SOPHISTICATION THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR OWN ARMS. WE CAN EXACTLY WHEN SOMEBODY’S PULLING TOO HARD AND LET GO REFLEXIVELY. THE ROBOTIC ARMS AREN’T INSTRUMENTED QUITE THAT WELL, SO A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE DO IS TO ANALYZE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LOADS ARE NOT GOING TO BE SO LARGE THAT THE ARM GETS DAMAGED, OR THE OPERATING BASE THAT IT’S WORKING FROM GETS DAMAGED, OR THE PAYLOAD THAT WE’RE HANDING OFF GETS DAMAGED. AGAIN, THE COMPLEXITY OF THAT BIG PICTURE IS REALLY REMARKABLE. >> SO I MEAN, IN SPACE, THOUGH-- YOU THINK ABOUT IT-- I MEAN, THERE’S-- YOU DON’T REALLY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GRAVITY. SO WHEN YOU’RE HANDLING THESE OBJECTS, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT WHEN HANDLING LARGE PAYLOADS? >> WELL, AND THAT’S RIGHT, BECAUSE NOTHING-- THERE’S NOT REALLY WEIGHT. >> MM-HMM. >> BUT THERE IS STILL MASS. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> AND WITH MASS COMES INERTIA AND MOMENTUM. >> YES. >> AND ANYTHING THAT YOU GET MOVING YOU’RE EVENTUALLY GOING TO HAVE TO SLOW DOWN. AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT MANEUVERING MODULES AROUND. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE OFTEN JOKE THAT THESE ROBOTS, GOSH, THEY MOVE SO SLOWLY. >> RIGHT. >> AND THAT’S NOT TO SAY THAT THEY COULDN’T MOVE FASTER, BUT IF THEY DID, THERE WOULD BE CONSEQUENCES. WE HAVE SEEN-- YOU GET MODULES MOVING REALLY QUICKLY AND THEN ALL OF THAT MOMENTUM HAS TO BE TAKEN OUT AT THE OTHER END OF THE MOTION. >> YOU’VE GOT TO STOP, YEAH. >> OTHERWISE THE STATION’S ORIENTATION WOULD HAVE TO ADJUST TO THAT. >> OH, ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, EVEN THE STATION’S ORIENTATION CHANGES WHEN ASTRONAUTS ARE WORKING OUT. AND THEY BUILT SYSTEMS TO MITIGATE THAT. SO IF YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT A REALLY LARGE OBJECT, I MEAN, YOU DON’T DO IT RIGHT AND YOU CAN FLING-- YOU CAN-- YOU KNOW-- >> YOU CAN FLIP THE STATION OVER. >> YEAH. >> BECAUSE THESE MODULES OFTEN WEIGH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF POUNDS. >> WOW. >> AND AGAIN, WE MANEUVER THOSE WITH GREAT CARE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE’RE MANAGING THAT MOMENTUM IN AN INTELLIGENT WAY SO THAT, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, THE MOMENTUM DOESN’T GET THE BEST OF US.  >> SO BY MANAGING MOMENTUM, THAT’S WHERE MOVING THINGS SLOWLY FROM POINT A TO POINT B COMES INTO PLACE. >> THAT’S RIGHT. >> ABSOLUTELY. AND I’M GUESSING THERE’S SOME SORT OF SPECIAL TECHNIQUE, TOO, IN ORDER TO DO THAT, RIGHT? BECAUSE YOU’VE SAID, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO START A MOTION, BUT THEN ALSO STOP. IS THERE LIKE A SLOW ACCELERATION AND THEN A SLOW DECELERATION? IS THERE A FANCY TECHNIQUE YOU GUYS USE? >> I’M NOT SURE HOW FANCY A TECHNIQUE IT IS. >> OKAY. >> YOU MAKE SURE YOU’RE NOT GETTING IT GOING TOO FAST. YOU WANT TO-- THE ARM IS DESIGNED TO MOVE THINGS IN STRAIGHT LINES. IF THAT IS OUR DESIRE-- CERTAINLY IF WE ARE BERTHING A MODULE INTO THAT BERTHING INTERFACE ON THE SPACE STATION, IT NEEDS TO GO IN RIGHT ALONG AT A PERFECT, ALIGNED AXIS FOR THE MECHANISM TO LINE UP PROPERLY. AND WE CAN DO THAT, AND AGAIN, THAT GENERALLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN PRETTY SLOWLY, BECAUSE IF YOU PUSH TOO HARD, AGAIN, IF YOU’RE PUSHING THAT DRAWER INTO YOUR CHEST OF DRAWERS AT HOME, IF YOU PUSH IT TOO HARD, IT’S GOING TO BANG AT THE BACK. OR IF YOU’RE PULLING IT OUT, AND IT STICKS, AND YOU PULL HARDER AND HARDER AND HARDER, ALL OF A SUDDEN WHEN IT LETS GO-- WE’VE ALL FELT THAT-- ALL OF A SUDDEN IT JERKS OUT AT US. >> YEAH. >> AND WE WANT TO AVOID THAT SORT OF MOMENTUM RELEASE ON THE SPACE STATION. >> ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, IT SEEMS PRETTY INTUITIVE TO US, RIGHT-- YOU KNOW, IF YOU FEEL SOMETHING PULLING TOO HARD, THEN PULL A BIT HARDER OR SOMETHING, MAKE IT COME OUT, DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. AND YOU CAN MAKE THOSE DECISIONS REAL TIME, BUT IF YOU’RE DESIGNING A SYSTEM TO DO THAT, YOU’VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT ALL THESE MINUTE LITTLE THINGS. I KNOW-- I MEAN, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I DO COMMENTARY SOMETIMES IN MISSION CONTROL, AND WE’LL DO THAT FOR CAPTURING CARGO. SO WE’LL CAPTURE A SPACEX DRAGON OR AN ORBITAL ATK CYGNUS VEHICLE. AND YOU KNOW, IT’LL HAVE THIS MOTION WHERE IT CAPTURES, AND WE’LL ACTUALLY GO OFF-AIR FOR A LITTLE BIT ONCE IT’S CAPTURED. WE’LL SAY THE CAPTURED TIME, AND THEN WE GO OFF-AIR FOR ABOUT AN HOUR, MAYBE AN HOUR AND SOME CHANGE, AND THEN WE’LL COME BACK ON WHEN IT’S IN BERTHING POSITION. BECAUSE IT’S THIS BIG PROCEDURE, YOU KNOW, WHERE IT HAS TO TURN, AND WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN, SO THERE’S LITTLE COMMENTARY WE CAN ADD BETWEEN THAT. BUT YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE THAT PROCEDURE IN ORDER TO BERTH IT. >> RIGHT, AND THAT CARGO VEHICLE, WHICH WEIGHS PROBABLY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF POUNDS, IS GOING TO BE FLIPPED AROUND, MANEUVERED AROUND REALLY SLOWLY SO THE SPACE STATION’S MOMENTUM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CAN SORT OF KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THAT AND ALLOW THE SPACE STATION TO MAINTAIN THE PROPER ORIENTATION, KEEP THE SOLAR ARRAYS POINTED AT THE SUN, KEEP THE ANTENNAS POINTED AT THE SATELLITES. >> WOW-- JUST A LOT OF THINGS YOU HAVE TO THINK OF. BUT YOU KNOW, KIND OF GOING BACK TO THE HISTORY, YOU BRIEFLY MENTIONED THAT, I MEAN, THERE WAS A CONVERSATION THAT STARTED WITH NASA AND-- I’M SORRY, IT WAS NOT CSA AT THE TIME, IT WAS-- >> CSA WAS ESTABLISHED BY AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT IN 1989. >> OH, OKAY. >> AND BEFORE THAT, CSA-- CANADIAN SPACE AGENCY-- DIDN’T EXIST. IT WAS THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL. >> OKAY. >> AND THAT WAS SORT OF THE ORIGINAL SCIENCE ORGANIZATION WITHIN THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT THAT ESTABLISHED THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH NASA, WORKED WITH CANADIAN INDUSTRY TO DESIGN AND BUILD WHAT WE CALL THE CANADARM, THE REMOTE MANIPULATOR SYSTEM. >> YEAH. >> AND THEN PROVIDE THAT TO BE PART OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM. >> OKAY. SO WHAT WAS THE-- WHY DID NASA GO AND HAVE THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NATIONAL RESOURCE COUNCIL? SO WHAT WAS IT-- DID YOU ALREADY-- WERE YOU ALREADY INVENTING ROBOTIC ARMS? >> I THINK AT THAT TIME, THE ROBOTIC ARM WAS A RELATIVELY NEW CONCEPT. >> OKAY. >> THERE WERE ENGINEERS WHO REALIZED THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD DO. THE INDUSTRIAL GROUP THAT WAS PART OF THAT, WHICH INCLUDED WHAT WAS THEN SPAR AEROSPACE, WHO WERE THE PRIME CONTRACTOR FOR THE ROBOTIC ARM, THEY ALREADY HAD A HISTORY WITH ANTENNAE AND SPACE MECHANISMS THAT WENT ON SATELLITES. AND I THINK THIS WAS A NATURAL EXPANSION OF SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD DO. AND IT WAS KIND OF A REVOLUTIONARY DESIGN. IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN DONE IN SPACE BEFORE. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> AND ONCE THAT CAPABILITY ARRIVES AND YOU START USING IT-- JUST AS WHEN YOU GET A NEW TOOL AT HOME-- IT’S COOL, AND YOU PLAY WITH IT. AND ONCE YOU START PLAYING WITH IT, THEN YOU REALLY START TO SAY, “HEY, I COULD USE IT FOR THIS. I COULD USE IT FOR THIS.” AND AS I WAS SAYING BEFORE, WHEN LITTLE CONTINGENCIES COME UP, YOU GO, “OKAY, WELL, LET’S GO TAKE A LOOK AT IT WITH THE ARM.” SO YOU CAN GET THE ARM IN A NEW POSITION IT’S NEVER BEEN IN AND POINT A CAMERA TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOMETHING. >> RIGHT. >> GO KNOCK THAT ICICLE OFF-- WHATEVER THE NEW CAPABILITIES ARE. AND THAT’S WHAT ROBOTS BRING, IS THIS ABILITY TO CONTROL YOUR ENVIRONMENT AND EXPAND YOUR CAPABILITY. >> SO WHENEVER-- YOU SAID THE FIRST CANADARM FLEW ON STS-2, RIGHT? AND THAT WAS RELATIVELY QUICKLY-- IT WAS ALREADY ON SHUTTLE FLIGHTS. SO WHAT DID YOU START LEARNING THROUGH THAT PROCESS OF-- I GUESS YOU WENT ON MORE SHUTTLE FLIGHTS AFTER THAT, RIGHT? THE CANADARM 1? >> RIGHT, THE ORIGINAL CANADARM. I DON’T KNOW THE PROPORTION OF HOW MANY FLIGHTS IT WAS ON, HOW MANY IT WASN’T. MOST TIMES THAT THEY NEEDED TO DEPLOY A SATELLITE-- SOMETIMES THE SATELLITES WOULD-- THERE WOULD BE A MECHANISM THAT WOULD JUST SORT OF POP IT OUT OF THE PAYLOAD BAY. >> YEAH. >> BUT OFTEN, IF THERE WAS A SATELLITE CAPTURE THAT NEEDED TO GO ON, YOU NEEDED THE ARM TO HAVE THE SHUTTLE FLY UP-- THE ARM WOULD THEN REACH OUT, GRAB THE SATELLITE, AND THEN MAYBE BERTH IT INTO SOMETHING IN THE PAYLOAD BAY. IF THERE WERE SPACEWALKS, YOU COULD PUT AN ASTRONAUT IN A FOOT RESTRAINT STANDING ON THE END OF THE ARM, AND HAVE THE ARM MANEUVER THAT ASTRONAUT AROUND. >> OKAY. >> BECAUSE AGAIN, IN SPACE, YOU’RE NOT STANDING ON ANYTHING. YOU’RE NOT MOVING IN THE CONVENTIONAL SENSE THAT WE ARE USED TO, WORKING ON A WORKSITE HERE IN 1 G. >> RIGHT. >> SO IT WAS JUST A SERIES OF MORE AND MORE EXPANSIVE CAPABILITIES. AND THERE ARE ACTUALLY SOME REALLY NEAT PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THOSE EARLY SHUTTLE MISSIONS. THEY WERE EXPERIMENTING WITH BUILDING TRUSSES. THIS WAS BEFORE SPACE STATION, AND THEY WERE IMAGINING HOW SPACE STATION MIGHT BE BUILT. AND SOME OF THOSE EARLY CONCEPTS WERE SORT OF STICKS AND BALLS, AND THEY WOULD MAKE THESE BIG TRUSSES AND MANEUVER THEM AROUND. >> THAT’S AMAZING. SO WHEN YOU’RE LEARNING ALONG THIS WAY, YOU HAVE A NEED-- FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE IT SAYS, “HEY, WE NEED A-- WE HAVE SOMETHING COMING UP WHERE WE’RE GOING TO HAVE TO PROBABLY PUT AN ASTRONAUT AT THE END OF THIS ARM.” SO DO YOU DEVELOP TOOLS THAT THEY CAN INTERACT WITH IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO THEY CAN PUT THEIR FEET IN THERE? >> RIGHT, THE ARM WOULD HAVE NEEDED TO BE FITTED WITH SOME SORT OF SOCKET OR FIXTURE. SO WHAT THEY CALL A FOOT RESTRAINT COULD BE REALLY SECURELY ATTACHED, BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS YOU PUT IT ON BUT THEN WHEN YOU’RE STANDING ON IT, IT FLOATS OFF. >> YEAH. >> SO IT’S ALL ABOUT CREW SAFETY, AND THE CREW HAS GOT TO BE SAFELY ATTACHED AND THEN SAFELY TETHERED IN A REDUNDANT WAY SO THEY DON’T FLOAT AWAY. BUT YEAH, EVERY TIME WE HAVE A NEW CAPABILITY LIKE THAT, OFTEN WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE HARDWARE AND GO, “OKAY, WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO AND ADJUST OR ADD?” BUT A THING TO REMEMBER THERE-- ON THE SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM, THE SPACE SHUTTLE CAME HOME AFTER ITS MISSION, WHETHER IT WAS ONE WEEK, OR TWO WEEKS, OR WHATEVER IT WAS. >> RIGHT. >> AND THE GUYS AT SPAR WOULD GET THAT ARM BACK, AND THEY WOULD GET TO LOVINGLY DOTE OVER IT AND SEE HOW IT WAS DOING. >> YEAH. >> AND THEN PREPARE ANOTHER ARM. AND THERE WERE A FEW ARMS THAT I THINK GOT ROTATED BETWEEN THE SPACE SHUTTLES. THEY COULD BE TAKEN OFF AND PUT BACK ON. >> RIGHT, THERE WERE MULTIPLE SHUTTLES AND MULTIPLE MISSIONS. >> RIGHT. >> YEAH. >> SO THAT SORT OF ADJUSTMENT COULD BE MADE RELATIVELY EASY. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND WHAT WE HAVE NOW ON SPACE STATION IS THAT CANADARM2 WAS LAUNCHED IN APRIL 2001 ON A SPACE SHUTTLE MISSION. IT WAS ATTACHED TO THE SPACE STATION AND HAS BEEN THERE EVER SINCE. >> STILL WORKING. >> STILL WORKING, YES. STILL WORKING MORE THAN 16 YEARS LATER. >> WOW. >> AND THAT’S JUST A WONDERFUL THING, AND WHAT WE’VE REALLY SEEN IS THAT ESPECIALLY IN RECENT YEARS, THE PACE OF THE ROBOTICS WORK HAS JUST BEEN INCREASING. I TALKED ABOUT THE FREEFLYING CARGO VEHICLES. THE VERY FIRST ONE-- AND WHAT A MILESTONE THAT WAS-- IN 2009 WITH THE FIRST JAPANESE CARGO VEHICLE. AND THEN THE U.S. COMMERCIAL VEHICLES STARTED FLYING-- THE SPACEX DRAGON AND THE ORBITAL ATK CYGNUS VEHICLES. AND THEY DID THEIR DEMO FLIGHTS, THEN THEY WOULD START-- AND THE PACE HAS BEEN INCREASING. SO NOW WE DO ONE OF-- WE ARE CAPTURING A FREEFLYING CARGO VEHICLE EVERY MONTH OR TWO. >> THAT’S RIGHT-- WE HAVE TWO COMING UP IN NOVEMBER. >> RIGHT. THIS YEAR, THIS CALENDAR YEAR, 2017, ALL GOING WELL, WE WILL HAVE DONE SIX FREEFLYING CARGO VEHICLES. LAST YEAR I THINK IT WAS FIVE. >> WOW. >> THE PACE IS ALWAYS INCREASING. AND THE SPACE STATION PROGRAM IS REALIZING, TOO, THAT OUR ABILITY TO DO MAINTENANCE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE ISS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT, VALUABLE THING. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> AND NOW THAT WE’VE DEMONSTRATED THAT WE’RE ABLE TO DO IT-- AND JUST AS WITH US AS HUMANS, THE FIRST TIME YOU DO SOMETHING, YOU ALWAYS THINK ABOUT IT A LOT MORE, IT ALWAYS SEEMS A LITTLE BIT HARDER. BUT ONCE YOU’VE DONE SOMETHING A COUPLE OF TIMES, YOU KIND OF GET THE HANG OF IT. >> YEAH. >> AND NOW WE’VE DONE A FEW MAINTENANCE TASKS WITH THOSE POWER CONTROLLER MODULES. WE RELATIVELY RECENTLY DID WHAT’S CALLED A MAIN BUS SWITCHING UNIT, WHICH IS PART OF THE SPACE STATION POWER SYSTEM. >> MM-HMM. >> AND THE DEMAND IS INCREASING. HEY-- WE’VE DONE THIS BEFORE. CAN WE SLIP THIS TASK IN BETWEEN THIS FREEFLYING VEHICLE AND THIS FREEFLYING VEHICLE?  SO THE EFFORT-- THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT THE ROBOTS ARE CONTINUALLY DOING JUST SEEMS TO BE INCREASING, AND THAT’S THE REALLY EXCITING PART IS BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WAS BUILT TO BE USED. IT’S WORKING FABULOUSLY WELL. >> YEAH. >> AND THE MORE WE USE IT THE MORE THE APPETITE OF THE PROGRAM TO USE IT MORE-- BECAUSE WE CAN ACCOMPLISH MORE-- THAT APPETITE’S INCREASING AND THAT’S JUST GREAT. >> SO USES-WISE IT’S GOING UP. AND YOU SAID THERE’S A LOT OF STUFF THAT IT’S DOING, ESPECIALLY YOU WERE TALKING A LOT ABOUT CAPTURING CARGO VEHICLES. SO WHEN-- EVEN COMMERCIAL COMPANIES ARE DESIGNING THEIR CARGO VEHICLE-- THEY SAY, “WELL, HOW-- WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN ONCE IT GETS TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION?” AND THEY THINK, “WELL, THERE’S A ROBOTIC ARM. THE ROBOTIC ARM CAN CAPTURE IT AND THEY CAN DO THAT.” SO, I MEAN, YOU’VE GOT A LOT OF MISSIONS AND A LOT MORE TASKS COMING UP. AND YOU SORT OF HINTED AT IT, BUT WHAT IS IT DOING IN BETWEEN THESE CARGO MISSIONS? IT’S CAPTURING CARGO WHEN IT COMES TO THE STATION, BUT WHAT ELSE IS IT DOING? YOU MENTIONED THAT MPSU WAS ONE OF THEM-- THE POWER UNIT. >> RIGHT. WELL, THERE IS STATION MAINTENANCE AND ACTIVITIES. >> MM-HMM. >> BUT OFTEN, ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF THE SPACEX DRAGON VEHICLE, IT HAS IN BEHIND THE PRESSURIZED MODULE THERE IS WHAT WE CALL THE TRUNK, AND THAT’S A CYLINDRICAL SPACE THAT’S OPEN AT THE BACK AND THEY HAVE BEEN FLYING EXTERNAL CARGO IN THE TRUNK. AND THAT CARGO CAN ONLY BE EXTRACTED USING OUR ROBOTS. >> OH, YES. >> SO WE WILL-- FOR EXAMPLE, COMING RIGHT UP AT THE END OF THIS YEAR, SPACEX 13 IS GOING TO HAVE THREE ITEMS IN THE TRUNK THAT ARE GOING TO NEED TO BE DEPLOYED. SO AFTER THE BIG ARM CAPTURES THE DRAGON, BERTHS IT TO THE SPACE STATION, THEN WE’RE GOING TO GO HAVE THE BIG ARM PICK UP DEXTRE AND THEN WITH DEXTRE REACH INTO THE TRUNK AND TAKE THOSE THREE ITEMS OUT AND DO WITH THEM WHATEVER THEY ARE. MORE AND MORE LATELY, WE HAVE BEEN HANDLING SCIENCE PAYLOADS FOR EXTERNAL. IT’S NOT ACTUALLY MAINTENANCE. IT’S PART OF SPACE STATION SCIENCE THAT WE’RE ABLE TO SUPPORT WITH THE CANADIAN ROBOT. AND THOSE PIECES OF SCIENCE HARDWARE WERE MADE TO BE ATTACHED TO THE STATION TRUSS OR ONE OF THE MODULES SOMEPLACE. SOMETIMES WE TAKE OLD EXPERIMENTS OR OLD HARDWARE THAT’S NO LONGER NEEDED, THERE’S NOT ROOM FOR IT ANYMORE ON THE SPACE STATION, WE NEED THE ATTACHMENT POINT SO WE’LL PUT IT BACK IN THE TRUNK FOR IT TO BE DEORBITED. >> OH. >> AND THE STUFF IN THE TRUNK DOESN’T RETURN TO EARTH IN THE CONVENTIONAL SENSE. IT BURNS UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE. >> RIGHT. >> BUT IT NEEDS TO BE OFF THE STATION. SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO TAKE OUT THE TRASH, OTHERWISE THERE’S NO ROOM IN YOUR HOUSE ANYMORE. YEAH. I MEAN, THAT-- I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT AS AN ANALOGY WHILE YOU WERE DESCRIBING THAT. IT’S KIND OF LIKE YOU HAVE A SHIPMENT TO-- THAT’S DELIVERED TO YOUR HOUSE AND THEN YOU HAVE A ROBOT UNPACK IT FOR YOU AND PUT IT WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE. I THINK WE SHOULD PUT SOME OF THESE ROBOTIC ARMS IN OUR HOMES. >> THERE YOU GO. >> BECAUSE I REALLY DON’T WANT TO UNPACK MY GROCERIES ANYMORE. >> WELL, THERE YOU GO. >> I COULD JUST HAVE A CANADARM TO DO IT. >> AND OFTEN, AFTER YOU TAKE-- AFTER YOU TAKE THAT DELIVERY AT HOME THERE’S ALL THESE BOXES THAT YOU THEN GOT TO GET RID OF. >> YEAH. RIGHT. OH, YEAH, SO THEN IT CAN PACK OUT ALL MY GROCERIES, PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE, AND THEN THROW AWAY ALL THE BOXES THAT IT CAME IN. THERE YOU GO. >> THERE YOU GO. >> YEAH, YOU HAVE A LOT MORE CAPABILITIES TOO, BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED THE DEXTRE TOO. SO THE LATCHING END EFFECTOR CAN GRAB X, Y, AND Z, RIGHT? BUT, MAYBE IT CAN’T GRAB MLB, BUT IF YOU ATTACHED THE DEXTRE TO IT, DEXTRE CAN GRAB MLB, RIGHT? SO IT THAT KIND OF HOW IT WORKS? IT HAS DIFFERENT THINGS THAT IT CAN GRAB, DIFFERENT FINGERS? >> RIGHT, AND WITH DEXTRE, WE HAVE A MUCH MORE REFINED PRECISE CAPABILITY. >> MM-HMM. >> AND GIVEN ITS SIZE, IT’S LIKE OVER-- TRYING TO REMEMBER IN MY HEAD. IT’S OVER 17 METERS LONG, THE BIG ARM. >> WOW. >> IT STILL CAN PRECISELY POSITION ITS TIP TO WITHIN A COUPLE OF CENTIMETERS. >> HMM. >> BUT WITH DEXTRE, THOSE SMALLER ARM’S DESIGNED WITH MUCH MORE REFINED END EFFECTORS. THE PRECISION THAT IS POSSIBLE IS ACTUALLY KIND OF MILLIMETER LEVEL. >> WOW. >> AND WE SEE THAT LOOKING THROUGH-- WE HAVE A BORESIGHT CAMERA IN THOSE DEXTROUS ARM END EFFECTORS AND WE CAN SEE OURSELVES MANEUVERING DOWN ONTO THE GRASP FIXTURES. AND IT’S A VERY PRECISE CAPABILITY. SO IF WE NEED TO REMOVE SOME POWER CONTROLLER MODULE, THE POSITIONING REQUIREMENTS ARE FAIRLY TIGHT. >> YEAH. >> AND WITH DEXTRE WE HAVE THAT CAPABILITY AND IT’S PRETTY REMARKABLE TO SEE WHAT’S POSSIBLE. >> THERE YOU GO. DEXTRE CAN GET EXACTLY TO WHERE YOU NEED TO BE BY A MATTER OF MILLIMETERS. >> RIGHT. RIGHT. AND ALSO, WITH THAT FORCE IN MOMENT SENSING CAPABILITY THAT I DESCRIBED THAT WE HAVE WITH CANADARM2, WE ALSO HAVE IT IN DEXTRE’S DEXTROUS ARMS. >> OKAY. >> SO AGAIN, WHEN YOU’RE INSERTING A BOX INTO A SLOT, YOU REALLY VALUE THAT ABILITY TO DETECT THOSE SIDE FORCES. >> YEAH. >> AND MAKE SURE YOU’RE NOT GETTING IT BOUND UP. >> WOW. AND ALL OF THIS IS BEING OPERATED FROM THE GROUND, RIGHT? >> CONTROLLED FROM THE GROUND. >> SO WHO’S-- I GUESS, IS IT-- I ACTUALLY FORGOT TO ASK YOU THIS QUESTION NOW THAT I’M THINKING ABOUT IT. BUT, YOU SAID YOU WERE A FLIGHT CONTROLLER FOR A WHILE, YOU WERE ROBO. WHO WERE YOU TALKING TO TO PULL OFF SOME OF THESE MANEUVERS? BECAUSE YOU SAID IT’S A BIG COORDINATION ACT OBVIOUSLY ON YOUR END. THERE’S A DECENT AMOUNT OF COMMUNICATION THAT NEEDS TO GO BY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. >> WELL, AT THE VERY BEGINNING, AND I WAS A ROBO IN THOSE VERY FIRST YEARS STARTING IN 2001. >> MM-HMM. >> AT THAT POINT, WE WERE NOT YET ACTUALLY DOING GROUND CONTROLLED MOTION. THAT DIDN’T START UNTIL YEARS LATER, UNTIL AFTER I ACTUALLY HAD MOVED OUT OF THAT JOB. >> OH. OH, OKAY. >> WE WERE STILL COMMANDING OUR SYSTEM, SO WE WOULD POWER UP THE-- WE WOULD POWER THE SYSTEM UP BECAUSE THERE’S NO MOTION INVOLVED. BUT WHEN YOU POWER UP YOUR COMPUTER YOU PUSH THE BUTTON THAT STARTS THE POWER, YOU MIGHT DO THE LOG-IN, YOU MIGHT LOAD SOFTWARE IN A PARTICULAR WAY. >> MM-HMM. NONE OF THAT ACTUALLY MOVED ANYTHING. >> OH. >> WE SEND ALL OF THOSE COMMANDS. WE COULD ALSO PAN AND TILT THE CAMERAS. >> HMM. >> WHICH IS ACTUALLY MOTION IN A SMALL WAY. >> YEAH, YEAH. >> BUT, THE FLIGHT CONTROLLERS, THE COORDINATION IS THROUGH THE FLIGHT DIRECTOR. >> AH. >> AND FOR THE ROBOS, IT’S HOUSTON FLIGHT. >> OKAY. >> SO THAT’S OUR DIRECT REAL TIME AUTHORITY COMES FROM THE FLIGHT DIRECTOR. THAT’S WHO WE REPORT TO. >> OKAY. SO OKAY, YOU WERE MOVING HOUSTON FLIGHT I’M GOING TO DO-- MANEUVER X, Y, Z. >> EXACTLY. AND COORDINATING WITH THE OTHER FLIGHT CONTROLLERS IN THE ROOM. >> RIGHT. >> BECAUSE WE POWER CERTAINLY COMMUNICATIONS, ALL OF THAT INTERACTION NEEDS TO GO ON TO MAKE SURE-- AND THE TIMING JUST RIGHT, MAKE SURE IF THE CREW ARE EXERCISING AND THERE’S A LITTLE BIT OF VIBRATION, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE STAY AWAY FROM THAT ON THE SCHEDULE. >> MM-HMM. SO, SAY FOR EXAMPLE WE WERE DOING A-- WE’RE DOING A MANEUVER TO CAPTURE THE DRAGON, FOR EXAMPLE. AND SO, THE CREW IS THE ONE THAT ACTUALLY CAPTURES THE DRAGON NOW, RIGHT? SO THEY’RE-- >> RIGHT, THAT’S ONE THING WE DON’T DO FROM THE GROUND IS THE PREFLIGHT CAPTURES AND RELEASES. >> SO THEN AFTERWARDS, YOU HAVE TO MOVE IT INTO ITS BERTHING POSITION AND YOU DO THAT FROM THE GROUND, RIGHT? >> RIGHT. >> SO, WHO IS DOING THAT-- IS THERE COORDINATION WITH THE ROBO CONSOLE ON-- IN MISSION CONTROL HOUSTON, IS THERE A CANADIAN SPACE AGENCY INVOLVEMENT AS WELL? >> THE ROBO CONSOLE-- THE WAY IT WORKS IS WE HAVE THE FRONT ROOM, WHICH IS WHERE THE FLIGHT DIRECTOR IS. >> OKAY. >> AND USUALLY THE ROBO IS THERE, BUT ALSO HERE IN MISSION CONTROL THERE IS WHAT THEY CALL A BACK ROOM. >> OKAY. >> AND THERE ARE TWO MORE SUPPORT ROBOTICS FLIGHT CONTROLLERS WHO TALK TO THE ROBO AND THEY’RE PART OF THAT TEAM. >> OKAY. >> THERE IS ALSO A BACK ROOM IN MONTREAL. >> AH. >> SO THOSE SUPPORTING FLIGHT CONTROLLERS-- OR NOW, EVEN SOMETIMES EVEN THE ROBO, HIM OR HER SELF, CAN BE UP THERE IN MONTREAL, STILL TALKING TO HOUSTON FLIGHT. >> RIGHT. >> THAT COMMAND IN CONTROL LINE OF AUTHORITY STILL WORKS IN JUST THE SAME WAY. IT’S JUST A MATTER OF LOCATION. >> THERE YOU GO. >> AND AS WE’VE LEARNED WITH GROUND CONTROL ROBOTICS, LOCATION CAN BE WHERE YOU WANT IT TO BE. >> EXACTLY. WELL, I MEAN, ALL THIS STUFF THAT YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT IS GOING ON IN SPACE, SO AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THAT COORDINATION. AND IT’S A TEAM EFFORT, TOO. IT’S NOT JUST ONE GUY ON THE GROUND DOING THE WORK. I MEAN, YOU’RE WORKING WITH A DECENT TEAM. >> RIGHT. >> WHEN YOU’RE DOING THESE MANEUVERS. SO THAT’S FANTASTIC. BUT, YOU KIND OF MENTIONED-- SO GOING BACK TO CANADARM2, YOU MENTIONED IT’S BEEN UP THERE SINCE YOU SAID 2001? >> YUP. >> AND IT’S 16 YEARS OF OPERATION, WHICH IS AWESOME. >> PART OF THE SPACEWALK STAT ARE-- THAT WE’RE DOING HERE IN OCTOBER ARE FOR MAINTENANCE, RIGHT? SO IT NEEDS REGULAR MAINTENANCE. SO WHAT’S SOME OF THE STUFF THAT WE’RE DOING OVER THESE SPACEWALKS? >> WELL, EVEN THE MAINTENANCE SYSTEM ITSELF NEEDS TO BE MAINTAINED. >> THERE YOU GO. >> SO HERE WE ARE, AND THAT’S WHERE WE’RE GOING TO BE THIS THURSDAY. >> OKAY. >> THE LATCHING END EFFECTORS, THE LEEs ON CANADARM2 HAVE DONE ALL THIS HEAVY WORK OVER ALL THESE YEARS. AND WHAT WE HAD STARTED TO SEE A FEW YEARS AGO, MAYBE THREE YEARS AGO, IS WE HAD STARTED TO PERCEIVE SOME DEGRADATION IN THE LEE MECHANISMS AND WE WERE ABLE TO MONITOR THAT. WE SEE WITH SOME PRECISION THE CURRENTS AND THE RATES ON THE MOTORS. >> HMM. >> AND WE COULD SEE FROM THE TELEMETRY DATA DOWN FROM THE ARM THAT SOME OF THE MECHANISMS WERE SOMETIMES A LITTLE BIT STICKY. >> OH. >> AND WE TALKED-- STUDIED THAT A LOT. >> YEAH. >> TRENDED THE DATA AND IN 2015 THAT ANALYSIS LEAD US TO HAVE SPACEWALKING ASTRONAUTS GO OUT AND LUBRICATE THESE MECHANISMS IN THE CANADARM2 END EFFECTORS. >> OH. >> SO THE GUYS WENT OUT IN SPACESUITS AND THEY HAD-- THEY TOOK A WET LUBRICANT. IT’S SORT OF THIS GRAY GOO. >> MM-HMM. >> AND THEY WERE ABLE TO PUT THAT INTO THE MECHANISMS THAT WERE EXPOSED ON THE LATCHING END EFFECTOR TO MITIGATE THAT STICKINESS THAT WE HAD BEEN STARTING TO SEE. >> OKAY. >> AND THAT DID INDEED IMPROVE THINGS. WE SAW SOME IMPROVEMENT RIGHT AFTER THAT IN BOTH CASES. >> YEAH. >> BUT, IN THE CASE OF LEE-A, WE-- THERE’S TWO ENDS OF THE ARM. WE SIMPLY CALL IT A AND B. >> OKAY. >> AND IN THE CASE OF LEE-A, WHILE THERE WAS SOME IMPROVEMENT IT STILL WAS KIND OF GOING DOWNHILL AND WE COULD SEE THAT. >> OH, OKAY. >> AND WHAT WE SAW IN AUGUST-- I THINK IT WAS AUGUST 22nd, WE WERE GOING TO WALK THE ARM OFF TO GO-- I ACTUALLY FORGET WHAT WE WERE GOING TO GO DO. WE WERE GOING TO WALK OFF NODE 2 ONTO OUR MOBILE BASE SYSTEM. >> MM-HMM. >> AND THE LATCHES ON THE LEE-A ACTUALLY STALLED DURING THE COURSE OF THE GRAPPLE. >> OH. >> AND THAT’S QUITE UNUSUAL. >> OKAY. >> SO THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION THAT EVENING ON CONSOLE AND REAL TIME AND THEY RELEASED IT BACK OFF. WE TALKED ABOUT IT SOME MORE AND DECIDED, “YOU KNOW WHAT? WE’RE GOING TO DEFER THIS TASK, WE’RE GOING TO STAY HERE ON NODE 2 BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE WE NEED TO BE.” AT THAT POINT I THINK IT WAS JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AWAY, WE WERE GOING TO UNBERTH AND RELEASE SPACEX DRAGON 12. >> OKAY. >> WHICH WAS ONBOARD THE SPACE STATION AT THAT TIME. >> YEAH. >> AND HANDLING THE DRAGON VEHICLES-- WE ACTUALLY DON’T USE THOSE LATCHES. WE JUST USE THOSE SNARE CABLES. >> OKAY. >> WHICH IS VERY MUCH LIKE THE SHUTTLE ARM USED TO WORK. SO WE DECIDED TO STAY THERE. WE REALLY WANTED TO PROTECT THAT SCHEDULE. >> RIGHT. GET IT OUT IN TIME. >> SO THE VISITING VEHICLES CAN ARRIVE AND DEPART ON SCHEDULE. >> MM-HMM. >> DID THAT, RELEASED THE DRAGON. THAT WENT PERFECTLY WELL. AND SINCE THEN-- SINCE WE HAD BEEN ALREADY TALKING ABOUT END EFFECTOR MAINTENANCE WE WERE ALREADY WORKING WITH THE SPACE WORK EXPERTS HERE AT JSC TO START PLANNING AN END EFFECTOR REPLACEMENT. SO THAT WORK WAS ALREADY GOING ON. >> OKAY. >> SO WHEN WE HAD THIS LATCH STALL WITH LEE-A, WE SORT OF ADJUSTED OUR PLANS, SAID, “OKAY, WE’RE GOING TO GO DO LEE-A. WE’RE GOING TO DO IT RIGHT AWAY SO WE CAN GET CANADARM2 BACK UP TO FULL OPERATING POTENTIAL SO WE CAN GO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED TO DO.” >> ALL RIGHT. >> SO THAT GOT SCHEDULED IN FOR THIS THURSDAY. >> ALL RIGHT. SO LEE-A-- IS IT BEING-- IS IT A SWAP? ARE YOU REPLACING IT FOR A NEW LATCHING END EFFECTOR? >> THERE IS ALSO PART OF OUR SYSTEM-- WE HAVE CANADARM2, WE HAVE DEXTRE, WE ALSO HAVE WHAT WE CALL THE MOBILE BASE SYSTEM. >> OKAY. >> AND THIS IS A STRUCTURE THAT RIDES UP AND DOWN THE SPACE STATION TRUSS ON A LITTLE TROLLEY CALLED THE MOBILE TRANSPORTER. >> OKAY. >> SO THAT MOBILE BASE HAS FOUR OPERATING BASES FOR THE AMR, SO THE ARM CAN WALK ONTO IT AND GO RIGHT DOWN THE TRUSS. >> COOL. >> BUT ALSO, ON THE MOBILE BASE THERE IS ANOTHER LATCHING END EFFECTOR AND IT'S IN FACT AN IDENTICAL UNIT TO THE ONE THAT’S ON BOTH ENDS OF CANADARM2. WE USE THAT FOR TEMPORARILY STOWING LARGE ITEMS THAT WE’RE MOVING AROUND OUTSIDE. >> HMM. >> SO IF WE NEED TO DO MAINTENANCE OF SOMETHING BIG-- >> OKAY. >> --THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF TIMES WHEN THE-- WHEN A PUMP PACKAGE FAILED THAT WAS PART OF THE THERMAL CONTROL SYSTEM. AND THE PUMPS ARE BIG AND THEY NEEDED TO BE TEMPORARILY STOWED BEFORE THEY COULD BE DEORBITED. >> YEAH. >> AND WE WOULD STORE THOSE ON THAT END EFFECTOR ON THE MOBILE BASE. SO THAT’S A LEE. ALTHOUGH, IT’S BEEN IN SPACE SINCE 2002, 15 YEARS. >> WOW. >> IT’S ACTUALLY ONLY BEEN USED 15 TIMES. SO WHEN WE USE IT, IT’S VERY IMPORTANT. >> YEAH. >> BUT WE ACTUALLY ONLY USE IT RELATIVELY RARELY. >> YEAH. >> SO ON AVERAGE, ONCE A YEAR. SO WHAT WE’VE GOT, LOOKING AT THAT END EFFECTOR ON THE MOBILE BASE, WE’VE GOT THE IDEAL SPACE LATCHING END EFFECTOR. NOT ONLY DO WE KNOW THAT IT MADE IT UP HILL SAFELY AND IT’S IN SPACE, WE’VE ALSO BEEN CHECKING IT OUT ONCE A YEAR. >> SO IT IS UP TO SPEED. YOU’RE LIKE, “EH, WHY DON’T WE JUST USE THIS ONE.” >> SO WE’RE GOING TO USE THAT. SO WHAT WE’RE GOING TO DO THIS THURSDAY IS WE’RE GOING TO MOVE THE TIP OF THE ARM WE LEE-A RIGHT NEXT TO WHERE THAT MOBILE BASE END EFFECTOR IS. >> RIGHT. >> AND THE EVA CREW ARE GOING TO SWAP THE TWO. >> THERE YOU GO. OKAY, SO THAT’S A BIG PART OF THE FIRST SPACEWALK. >> RIGHT. AND WHAT THAT DOES IS IT RESTORES CANADARM2 TO MUCH IMPROVED OPERATING POTENTIAL. WE’VE GOT A LEE-A THAT WILL THEN HAVE WORKING LATCHES, WE CAN GO DO-- WE’VE GOT ORBITAL ATK-8 COMING RIGHT UP. >> YES. >> I THINK IT’S 0A-8. >> OA-8, THAT’S RIGHT. >> AND WE ACTUALLY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE WORKING LATCHES FOR THAT BECAUSE THE CYGNUS VEHICLES LIKE POWER RIGHT AFTER THEY’VE BEEN CAPTURED. AND TO GIVE THEM POWER THE LATCHES HAVE TO WORK. >> OKAY. >> SO WE ARE EAGER TO GO RESTORE THAT CAPABILITY. WE’LL THEN HAVE THIS SOMEWHAT DEGRADED END EFFECTOR ON THE MOBILE BASE AND A COUPLE MORE SPACEWALKS THIS MONTH, BUT THEN AT LEAST ONE MORE IN JANUARY. AND WE’RE GOING TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF A SHELL GAME. WE’RE GOING TO ALSO SWAP OUT LEE-B OFF CANADARM2, BECAUSE THAT ALSO-- IT’S NOT AS DEGRADED AS LEE-A, BUT THERE’S ALSO WE’D LIKE TO MOVE IT AROUND. >> RIGHT. >> WE WANT TO LEAVE LEE-B ON THE MOBILE BASE AS THAT END EFFECTOR FOR STOWING THINGS. >> OKAY. >> IT IS A LITTLE BIT DEGRADED, BUT GOOD ENOUGH THAT WE THINK IT’LL PROBABLY LAST THE REST OF THE PROGRAM. IF WE ONLY USE IT ONCE PER YEAR, WHICH HAS BEEN OUR AVERAGE. >> YEAH. >> IT’LL LAST FOR YEARS. IT’S LIKE DOG YEARS. IT’LL LAST A LONG TIME. AND LEE-A WE WILL ACTUALLY TAKE OFF AND BRING INSIDE THE SPACE STATION. >> HUH. >> AND THE TWO EVA-- SOMETIME IN JANUARY, WE’LL SEE THE TWO SPACEWALKING CREW MEMBERS BRING THIS BIG OIL BARREL OF A PACK-- AN END EFFECTOR PACKAGE INTO THE AIRLOCK WITH THEM. AND WE WILL ACTUALLY BRING IT DOWN TO EARTH INSIDE A DRAGON VEHICLE. >> OH, IT CAN FIT WHERE? IN THE TRUNK OF IN THE PRESSURIZED? >> WELL, REMEMBER, THE TRUNK BURNS UP. IT NEEDS TO COME DOWN ON THE INSIDE OR IT DOESN’T REALLY COME HOME. >> OH, SO IT’S GOING TO BE COMING IN THE PRESSURIZED PART? >> RIGHT. >> OKAY, VERY COOL. >> AND WE’RE GOING TO HAVE THAT. IT’S A BIG EXPENSIVE PACKAGE. WE REALLY DON’T WANT TO BURN IT UP. SO WE’RE GOING TO GO TO ALL THAT TROUBLE TO BRING IT DOWN, SEND IT BACK TO OUR PRIME CONTRACTOR IN BRAMPTON, ONTARIO, IS MacDONALD DETTWEILER. >> OKAY. >> THEY ARE THE EXPERTS AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE THE TASK OF REFURBISHING THIS LATCHING END EFFECTOR THAT’S BEEN IN SPACE FOR 16 YEARS. AND WHAT A WITNESS TO THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT AND TO SPACE HISTORY THIS THING HAS BEEN, RIGHT? >> YEAH. >> IT’S BEEN THERE FOR MOST OF SPACE STATION ASSEMBLY. >> RIGHT. >> AND ALL OF THIS MAINTENANCE, EXPOSED TO THE ENVIRONMENT, ALL THE ATOMIC OXYGEN, MICROMETEORITES, ALL THE PROPELLANT FROM ALL THE JETS, ALL THE LOADS THAT IT’S EXPERIENCED. AND THEY’RE GOING TO SORT OF PEEL IT BACK, REFURBISH IT, AND THEN RETURN IT TO FLIGHT STATUS. SO WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER END EFFECTOR SPARE READY WHEN WE NEED IT. >> WOW. ALL RIGHT. SO YOU GOT IT PLANNED OUT? SO YOU’VE GOT NEW END EFFECTORS COMING ON AND YOU’RE GOING TO HAVE REFURBISHED END EFFECTORS THERE. SO THAT’S PRETTY COOL. HOW MANY END EFFECTORS TOTAL THEN ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THROUGH THE END OF THE LIFE OF THE STATION? THAT WAS GOING TO BE-- >> WELL, THERE ARE TWO ON CANADARM2, AND WE’RE TALKING ABOUT SWAPPING OUT BOTH OF THOSE IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. >> RIGHT, RIGHT. >> THERE’S ONE ON DEXTRE, BECAUSE WHEN WE PUT DEXTRE DOWN THERE’S AN END EFFECTOR ON THE BOTTOM. >> OKAY. >> THERE’S THIS ONE ON THE MOBILE BASE I’VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. >> RIGHT. >> THERE IS A-- WE’RE USING THAT ONE ON THE MOBILE BASE AS A SPARE. >> UH-HUH. >> THERE IS ANOTHER ACTUAL SPARE STORED ON THE SPACE STATION TRUSS OUTSIDE SORT OF IN A BOX SAFE, WAITING TO BE USED. AND THAT ONE WILL GO ONTO CANADARM2 IN JANUARY. >> YUP, YUP. >> AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE ANOTHER ONE ON THE GROUND RIGHT NOW THAT'S PROBABLY GOING TO LAUNCH IN A FEW MONTHS TIME. >> HMM. >> WE CALL THAT OUR LAUNCH ON NEED END EFFECTORS, SO YOU NEED TO HAVE ENOUGH OF THESE THINGS SO THAT THEY CAN FAIL AND YOU HAVE TIME TO REPLACE THEM BEFORE YOU NEED ANOTHER ONE. >> WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE A AND B WAS IT? ARE THE TWO THAT ARE ON THE ARM RIGHT NOW? >> RIGHT. >> SOUNDS LIKE THEY’VE BEEN DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR. >> SIXTEEN YEARS, GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY AND, I MEAN, THE HARSH ENVIRONMENT, AND ALL THEY’VE ACCOMPLISHED, IT’S ACTUALLY AMAZING THAT THEY HAVE LASTED THIS LONG. >> YEAH. >> I WAS ON THE PROGRAM EARLY ON LOOKING AT THOSE DESIGNS, WE ARE PRETTY PLEASED THAT THESE THINGS HAVE LASTED SO LONG. WE EXPECTED MAYBE WE’D HAVE TO DO MAINTENANCE LIKE THIS EARLIER THAN WE HAVE. SO NO COMPLAINTS. >> ABSOLUTELY. AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU GOT A LOT OF PLAN B, C, D, ALL THE WAY DOWN TOO. >> THAT’S THE WAY WE ROLL HERE IN HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT. >> HEY, THAT’S PERFECT, RIGHT? BECAUSE YOU’RE SAYING, “OH, WE NEED-- THIS ONE’S NOT WORKING AS WELL AS IT COULD. OH, WE GOT A SPARE OVER HERE, AND A SPARE OVER HERE, SPARE OVER HERE. WE’LL TAKE THIS ONE OVER HERE.” SO THAT’S NOT BAD. A WHILE AGO--NOT A WHILE-- JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO YOU TALKED ABOUT IT CAN MOVE ON THIS MOBILITY UNIT, RIGHT? IT CAN WALK. THAT IS KIND OF A UNIQUE THING, RIGHT? SO WHEN YOU’RE THINKING ABOUT A ROBOTIC ARM, IT’S NOT JUST AN ARM THAT’S ON THE SIDE OF THE STATION AND CAN GRAB THINGS. THIS THING CAN MOVE TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATION. HOW DOES THAT WORK? >> WELL, THE ARM CAN WALK END OVER END. THAT’S WHY WE HAVE AN END EFFECTOR AT EACH END OF THE ARM. >> UH-HUH. >> ONE’S THE BASE. THE TIP OF THE ARM, JUST LIKE THE BASE, CAN REACH ANOTHER OPERATING BASE AND GRAPPLE IT, ENGAGE, CONNECT ELECTRICALLY. >> YEAH. >> POWER DOWN, POWER UP FROM THE NEW BASE, AND THEN LET GO AND WALK END OVER END. >> WOW. >> AND THE MOBILE BASE SYSTEM ON THE MOBILE TRANSPORTER AS I DESCRIBED HAS THESE BASE PLUGS ON IT. SO THE ARM CAN WALK ONTO THERE RIGHT OUT PORT OR STARBOARD TO THE EXTREME END OF THE TRUSS EVEN, DO WORK OUT THERE. >> YEAH, WHEREVER YOU NEED IT. >> WHEREVER IT NEEDS TO BE, AND THAT’S ANOTHER REALLY COOL ENHANCEMENT OVER THE SHUTTLE ARM SYSTEM. WHEN YOU LOOKED OUT THE AFT-- THE PAYLOAD BAY WINDOWS ON THE SHUTTLE, THE ARM WAS ALWAYS THERE. THE SHOULDER WAS ALWAYS EXACTLY IN THE SAME PLACE ON THE PORT SIDE OF THE VEHICLE. AND THIS IS A NEW SYSTEM, IT’S A NEW ENVIRONMENT. >> YEAH. >> AND SPACE STATION IS A BIG COMPLEX STRUCTURE. THERE’S ALL SORTS OF PLACES YOU MIGHT NEED TO BE. AND IN FACT, RELATIVELY RECENTLY, WE EVEN INSTALLED A BASE POINT ON ONE OF THE RUSSIAN MODULES, WHAT WE CALL THE FGB. SO THE FORWARD MOST PART OF THE RUSSIAN SEGMENT NOW HAS A POWER AND DATA GRAPPLE FIXTURE ON IT. AND THE ARM CAN WALK ON THERE TO REACH EVEN FURTHER BACK IF IT NEEDS TO AND WE’VE DONE SOME SURVEYS FROM THERE. >> OH, THERE YOU GO. SO POWER AND DATA GRAPPLE FIXTURE, THAT’S-- WHEN IT’S WALKING IT NEEDS TO GRAB ONTO ONE OF THOSE IN ORDER TO GET POWER AND DATA SO YOU CAN SEND THE COMMANDS? >> TO BE A BASE POINT, THAT’S RIGHT. >> YEAH. >> IT NEEDS ELECTRICAL POWER. THE ARM IS ALL ELECTRIC. >> UH-HUH. >> THEY ARE DC ELECTRIC MOTORS-- >> YEAH. >> --ON EACH OF THE JOINTS AND EACH OF THE MECHANISMS ON THE END EFFECTOR. AND OF COURSE DATA, IT SEEMS LIKE WE DON’T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT A COMPUTER THESE DAYS. THE ARM HAS ONBOARD COMPUTERS THAT CONTROL EACH JOINT AND EACH JOINT HAS A COMPUTER THAT CONTROLS THE MOTOR MODULE. >> YUP, BECAUSE IF YOU SEND IT A COMMAND YOU WANT IT TO DO WHAT YOU’RE ASKING TI TO DO. >> RIGHT. AND ALSO, THOSE COMPUTERS GATHER THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE INSIGHT INTO WHAT THE ARM IS DOING AND HOW THE ARM IS DOING. >> YEAH, THERE YOU GO. OH, WELL, THAT’S WHERE YOU’RE GETTING THAT DATA WHERE YOU CAN FIND OUT, “OH, THIS IS DEGRADING A LITTLE BIT AND WE’RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIX IT.” >> YEAH, “THAT MOTOR’S DRAWING A LITTLE BIT MORE CURRENT THAN WE THOUGHT. LET’S GO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.” >> MM-HMM. ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, SO NOW THE CANADARM HAS BEEN UP THERE FOR 16 YEARS, YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT ROBOTIC ARMS THAT HAVE BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT SINCE THE ‘70s, AND THEN YOU STARTED FLYING IN THE ‘80s. THIS HAS A LONG HISTORY OF ROBOTIC ARMS. HAS ANY OF THE TECHNOLOGY BEEN BROUGHT DOWN TO EARTH IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM? >> IT HAS. >> OKAY. >> AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS AND THE ONES I CAN THINK OF RIGHT HERE ARE MOSTLY MEDICAL. >> HMM. >> IT’S POSSIBLE TO DO VERY, VERY FINE, EVEN MICROSCOPIC SURGERY WITH VERSIONS OF ROBOTIC ARMS. >> OH. >> AND THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THAT’S BASED ON, AS IT TURNS OUT, IS DIRECTLY DERIVED FROM THE WORK THAT WE’VE DONE ON SPACE STATION WITH CANADARM2. >> HOW ABOUT THAT. >> SO THERE’S A SYSTEM IN THAT WAS DESIGNED IN CANADA CALLED NEUROARM, WHICH HAS DONE BRAIN SURGERY AND THERE’S A GROWING LIST OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HELPED BY THAT. THERE’S A SMALLER PEDIATRIC VERSION CALLED KIDSARM. >> OH, WOW. >> AND THERE IS-- LET ME THINK, THERE IS A SYSTEM CALLED IMAGE GUIDED AUTONOMOUS ROBOT, IGAR, WHICH GOT SOME RECOGNITION. AND THAT’S-- IT’S ABLE TO DO BREAST CANCER SURGERIES FOR VERY SMALL PROCEDURES. >> WOW. >>SO THIS TECHNOLOGY IS PROLIFERATING. >> YEAH. I MEAN, SO YOU PRETTY MUCH JUST TAKE THE CANADARM2, WHICH IS HOW LONG DOES IT STRETCH? FIFTEEN METERS IS IT? OR IS IT-- >> NO, WAS IT 17 OR 18 METERS, I THINK. >> SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN? OH, OKAY. I’M THINKING 15, BUT OKAY. YEAH, 17 OR 18 METERS, YOU BRING THAT DOWN TO A SMALLER SCALE IN A WAY, RIGHT? >> WELL, AND IT'S NOT EVEN JUST THE PHYSICALITY OF IT. >> OKAY. >> IT IS THE TECHNOLOGY OF CONTROLLING COORDINATED MOTION IN VERY REFINED WAYS. >> RIGHT. RIGHT. I MEAN, VERY MICROSCOPIC MOVEMENTS LIKE YOU WERE SAYING. >> RIGHT. >> AND IS THAT-- SO YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE THIS RESPONSIVE TECHNOLOGY WHERE IF YOU’RE MOVING IT CAN FEEL THE TURN AND STUFF LIKE THAT. IS THAT PART OF IT TOO? >> I THINK A BIG PART OF IT IS THE ABILITY TO OPERATE THE ROBOT IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU CAN GUIDE IT VISUALLY. >> OKAY. >> WORKING INSIDE-- LIKE, WORKING CT SCAN ENVIRONMENTS WHERE YOU HAVE ALL OF THE SENSORS SO YOU CAN REALLY SEE WHAT’S GOING ON INSIDE SOMEONE’S BODY AND THERE’S THE ROBOT ACTUALLY OPERATING RIGHT THERE WHILE THE SCAN’S GOING ON. >> AH, OKAY. >> BUT ALSO, AT A MICROSCOPIC LEVEL. BECAUSE WE HUMANS-- IF YOU REDUCE EVERYTHING TO A SMALL ENOUGH SCALE IT’S ACTUALLY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THINGS THAT PRECISELY. BUT THE ROBOT, IF YOU GEAR EVERYTHING DOWN THE ROBOT CAN REALLY HELP YOU WITH THAT. >> OH, YEAH. >> SO IF-- YOUR HANDS MAY NOT TREMBLE, BUT WHEN YOU’RE AT THE MICRON LEVEL YOUR HAND’S REALLY TREMBLING AND YOU’RE NOT EVEN AWARE OF IT. >> YEAH. >> BUT THAT’S THE LEVEL OF CONTROL THAT THEY’RE ABLE TO PROVIDE WITH THESE MICROSCOPIC BRAIN SURGERY ROBOTS. >> HOW ABOUT THAT. >> AND THAT’S REALLY HELPING PEOPLE, AND THAT’S EXCITING. >> THAT’S VERY EXCITING. I’M THINKING ABOUT-- THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MIND IS THREADING A NEEDLE WITH YOUR HAND, HOW DIFFICULT THAT IS JUST OUT OF SCALE. YOU GET TO THAT SMALL AND YOU START SHAKING AND YOU CAN’T SEE. >> RIGHT. >> BUT IF YOU GET THE INSTRUMENTS YOU CAN DO IT. >> AND YOU’RE TALKING EVEN SMALLER THAN THAT. >> WOW. OH, YEAH, YOU’RE RIGHT, BECAUSE MICROSCOPIC. >> RIGHT. >> SO WE ONLY HAVE A FEW MINUTES LEFT SO I’LL KIND OF-- WE’LL LEAVE OFF WITH THIS: WHAT’S THE FUTURE OF ROBOTIC ARMS? IS THERE GOING TO BE A CANADARM3? OR IS THERE THINGS YOU’RE THINKING ABOUT FOR MISSIONS BEYOND INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION? >> WELL, WE ARE THINKING ABOUT CANADARM3. >> OKAY. >> AND WHAT WE DO IN THESE PROGRAMS, CERTAINLY WHAT WE DID WITH CANADARM2, IS WE LOOKED AT OUR EXPERIENCE ON THE SHUTTLE. >> MM-HMM. >> AND WE TOOK THAT OPERATING PARADIGM AND SAID, “OKAY, WHAT DID WE LEARN? WHAT MORE CAN WE DO?” AND SURE ENOUGH, IF YOU LOOK AT CANADARM2 IT’S MORE COMPLEX, BUT IT’S A MUCH MORE CAPABLE SYSTEM. WE’RE LOOKING AT WHAT A CANADARM3 COULD BE. AND ONE THING THAT WE ARE HEARING A LOT ABOUT IN OUR MODERN WORLD IS AUTONOMY. >> OH. >> WE HEAR A LOT THESE DAYS ABOUT SELF-DRIVING CARS. >> YUP. >> BECAUSE THE COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY NOW EXISTS WHERE THE COMPUTERS CAN PROCESS, AND MAKE SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS, AND CAN DO THE TAKE ME FROM POINT A TO POINT B. >> RIGHT. >> WHEREAS JUST EVEN-- EVEN A FEW YEARS AGO, THAT WASN’T EVEN CONCEIVABLE. >> MM-HMM. >> WE ARE STARTING TO LOOK AT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE FOR TO START INTRODUCING MORE AUTONOMY INTO THESE SORT OF ROBOTS. >> THAT IS EXCITING. >> RIGHT. AND AGAIN, AND WE’RE NOT TALKING ABOUT-- I DON’T NEED TO NAME THE MOVIES, BUT I’M NOT TALKING ABOUT ROBOTS GOING CRAZY AND ACTING INDEPENDENTLY. >> SURE. >> IT’S ABOUT-- YOU CAN CALCULATE THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO GET FROM THIS ARM POSITION TO THIS ARM POSITION, THEN YOU CAN GRASP THAT GRAPPLE FIXTURE, THEN YOU CAN CHANGE BASE. >> MM-HMM. >> AND THE ABILITY, PRACTICALLY SPEAKING, IS THERE TO GO DO THAT AND WE’RE STARTING TO LOOK AT HOW WE MIGHT INTRODUCE THAT INTO A SPACE ENVIRONMENT. >> HOW ABOUT THAT. THAT’S PRETTY EXCITING-- AUTOMATIC. >> AND AGAIN, THAT’S AN ENHANCEMENT IN TERMS OF SAVING TIME. WE’RE ALREADY SAVING TIME FOR THE ASTRONAUTS BECAUSE THE GROUND IS DOING IT. BUT NOW, WE CAN ACTUALLY SAVE TIME SO THAT THE GROUND CONTROLLERS DON’T HAVE TO BE THERE FOR EVERY SINGLE STEP, EVERY SINGLE COMMAND. >> MM-HMM. >> AND INDEED, THESE DAYS, IF WE LOSE COMM WITH THE SPACE STATION, IF THERE’S WHAT WE CALL AN LOS, A LOS OF SIGNAL, PERIOD-- >> RIGHT. >> --WE HAVE TO SIT AND WAIT. HOWEVER, WHAT IF YOU GET YOUR COMMAND IN BEFORE YOU LOSE COMM AND THE ROBOT CAN BE THERE WAITING FOR YOU-- AT THE END OF ITS MANEUVER WAITING FOR YOU WHEN YOU COME BACK IN. >> BECAUSE LOSS OF SIGNALS CAN BE-- CAN GET UPWARDS OF TENS OF MINUTES. SO YOU COME BACK AND IT’S ALREADY PART OF THE WAY THROUGH THE JOB. THAT’S NOT BAD. >> IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT’S GOING ON, BUT YEAH. AND AS YOU START TO GO FURTHER AFIELD, IF YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT-- WELL, EVEN THE MOON, BUT CERTAINLY MARS WHERE THE LATENCIES, THE RADIO DELAYS ARE SUCH THAT SENDING A COMMAND AND THEN WAITING TO SEE THAT IT COMPLETED CORRECTLY BEFORE YOU SEND THE NEXT ONE. >> YES. >> IF THE ROUNDTRIP FOR THAT IS 40 MINUTES, THEN THAT’S REALLY GOING TO SLOW EVERYTHING DOWN. BUT, IF YOU CAN TELL YOUR ROBOT, “GO MOVE FROM HERE TO THERE AND CHECK BACK WITH ME WHEN YOU’RE DONE.” THAT’S JUST GOING TO INTRODUCE A CAPABILITY-- IT’S NOT JUST MAKING IT MORE EFFICIENT, IT GIVES YOU A CAPABILITY THAT YOU DIDN’T HAVE BEFORE. >> HOW ABOUT THAT. THAT’S REALLY EXCITING. CAN’T WAIT. IS THERE A CHANCE THAT CANADARM3 IS GOING TO BE ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION SORT OF THING? >> NO, I THINK-- WE ARE GOING TO USE THE MSS, THE MOBILE SERVICING SYSTEM, AND CANADARM2 AS SORT OF A TEST BED FOR THAT TECHNOLOGY. >> OH, OKAY. >> WE HAVE THIS AMAZING ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE HAVE A MONITORED ENVIRONMENT, WE HAVE THINGS THAT NEED DOING. >> YEAH. >> WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN IT BECAUSE THERE’S ASTRONAUTS. AND ALSO, SOMETIMES WE DO ROBOT SELF MAINTENANCE. WE HAVE REPLACED A FEW OF OUR OWN CAMERAS WITH THE ROBOT, AND THAT’S REALLY COOL. >> YEAH. >> BUT WE HAVE THIS ENVIRONMENT THAT IS REALLY IDEAL TO DEVELOP SOME OF THAT NEXT GENERATION EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGY AND WE’RE STARTING TO LOOK AT THAT. >> WOW. VERY EXCITING. ALL RIGHT, WELL, TIM, THANKS FOR COMING ON THE SHOW TODAY. IT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY DECENT KIND OF OVERVIEW OF ROBOTIC ARMS HISTORY, AND CAPABILITY, FUTURE. THAT’S AWESOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> IT’S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE. THERE’S A LOT GOING ON. >> ABSOLUTELY. WELL, SO FOR THE LISTENERS, IF YOU STICK TOWARDS THE END OF PODCAST WE’LL TALK ABOUT-- TIM AND I KIND OF MENTIONED THE SPACEWALKS THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING, OR THAT ARE GOING TO HAPPEN HERE IN OCTOBER, SO YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THAT AND WHERE TO GO FOR QUESTIONS AND IDEAS. SO THANKS AGAIN, TIM. >> THANK YOU. [ MUSIC ] >> HOUSTON, GO AHEAD. >> I’M ON THE SPACE SHUTTLE. >> ROGER, ZERO-G AND I FEEL FINE. >> SHUTTLE HAS CLEARED THE TOWER. >> WE CAME IN PEACE FOR ALL MANKIND. >> IT’S ACTUALLY A HUGE HONOR TO BREAK THE RECORD LIKE THIS. >> NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY, BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD. >> HOUSTON, WELCOME TO SPACE. >> HEY, THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND. SO TODAY, WE TALKED WITH MR. TIM BRAITHWAITE ABOUT ROBOTIC ARMS IN SPACE AND WE REALLY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THIS TOPIC BECAUSE WE HAVE THREE SPACEWALKS IN THE MONTH OF OCTOBER AND ALL OF THEM HAVE TO DO WITH IN SOME WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM WITH DEALING WITH THE CANADARM2 ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. TWO OF THEM RIGHT NOW HAVE ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED. THERE WAS ONE ON OCTOBER 5th AND ANOTHER ONE ON OCTOBER 10th. THE ONE ON OCTOBER 5th WAS THE ONE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT, ME AND TIM, IN THIS EPISODE WHERE THEY REPLACED A LATCHING END EFFECTOR. AND THE THE LAST ONE, THEY WERE ACTUALLY USING THE LUBE THAT HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT TO GREASE UP THE INSIDE OF THE LATCH. WELL, THEY HAVE ONE MORE COMING UP AND IT’S GOING TO BE I GUESS AT THE TIME OF THIS RELEASE WILL BE NEXT WEEK ON OCTOBER 18th. SO YOU CAN TUNE IN AND KIND OF WATCH WHAT A SPACEWALK IS ALL ABOUT, YOU CAN GO ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION FACEBOOK ACCOUNT. WE’LL BE DOING A FACEBOOK LIVE THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE THING, BUT YOU CAN ALSO GO TO NASA TV OR WHEREVER YOU GET NASA TV. I THINK IT’S ON USTREAM AS WELL. IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW ALONG, JUST KIND OF GET THE HIGHLIGHTS OF EVERYTHING, WE DO EVERYTHING ON SOCIAL MEDIA, SO INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION FACEBOOK ACCOUNT IS A GREAT PLACE TO GET THAT INFORMATION. OTHERWISE, YOU CAN GO TO TWITTER, WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE LITTLE SNIPPETS. YOU KNOW TWITTER. WHAT AM I TELLING YOU ABOUT TWITTER FOR? AND INSTAGRAM @ISS. SO YOU CAN USE THE HASHTAG #ASKNASA ON YOUR FAVORITE TO SUBMIT AN IDEA FOR THE PODCAST, OR MAYBE DURING THE SPACEWALK COVERAGE YOU CAN ASK A QUESTION AND WE’LL TRY TO GET TO AS MANY AS POSSIBLE. I KNOW I’LL BE ONE OF THE COMMENTATORS FOR THE SPACEWALKS COMING UP. AND WE REALLY TRY TO ANSWER SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS DURING THE-- DURING COMMENTARY SO YOU KINDA OF UNDERSTAND WHAT’S GOING ON. SO PLEASE, ASK THOSE QUESTIONS AS IT’S GOING ON. OTHERWISE, YOU CAN SUBMIT QUESTIONS FOR THE PODCAST. JUST PUT IN-- MAKE SURE IT’S MENTIONED FOR “HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST” HWHAP. ACTUALLY, THAT’S HOW I GOT THAT QUESTION FROM JENNIFER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE. I WAS-- I’M SEARCHING FOR THAT STUFF, SO DON’T THINK I’M NOT PAYING ATTENTION. SO THIS PODCAST WAS RECORDED ON OCTOBER 3rd, 2017. THANKS TO ALEX PERRYMAN-- WHO ALWAYS HELPS OUT WITH EVERY EPISODE-- JOHN STOLL, DAN HUOT, AND OF COURSE THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICERS, THE COMMUNICATORS AT THE CANADIAN SPACE AGENCY. THANKS AGAIN TO MR. TIM BRAITHWAITE FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. WE’LL BE BACK NEXT WEEK.",

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 159, “Welcome Home Bob and Doug.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley have returned to planet Earth. After 64 days in orbit, Behnken and Hurley splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Pensacola, Florida, on the afternoon of August 2nd, 2020, concluding the Demo-2 mission and making history as the first human landing in a commercially built and operated spacecraft. Their mission was to test the capabilities of the new commercial space vehicle, the SpaceX Crew Dragon, for regular transportation of crew to the International Space Station. But they contributed a whole lot more than that on their mission during their 62 days aboard the station, they dedicated more than 100 hours to scientific investigation, working on experiments like droplet formation, electrolysis measurement, and Earth observation. Behnken performed four spacewalks with Station Commander Chris Cassidy to upgrade the station's power system among a number of other items like routing cables and installing robotic storage equipment and is now a record holder for the number of spacewalks and among the top for total hours spacewalking. After landing in the Gulf, they were taken to shore by helicopter and immediately flew back to Houston. There they were greeted by family and VIPs from NASA and SpaceX, all who contributed to the success of the mission. They were able to say a few words before departing for some much-needed rest, but we got to hear from them a few days later for a Q&A. They shared some fascinating details and perspective about their mission. So, on today's podcast, we're going to replay those moments for you here. So, here is a replay of the Welcome Home Ceremony at Ellington Field in Houston, Texas, on August 2nd, 2020, just five hours after splashing down and the Crew News Conference two days later on August 4th. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: In this first segment, hear the words from Doug Hurley then Bob Behnken immediately after landing in Houston. This was followed by some comments from NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and SpaceX CEO and Chief Engineer Elon Musk.  Doug Hurley: Alright. We're not going to stand right now. For those of you who have done this before, you know it's not pleasant standing for a few hours after you get back. Five hours ago, we were bobbing around in the Gulf of Mexico, so I feel like it's pretty good that we got this far in five hours. But I think the biggest thing that we would both like to talk about is just to thank, you know, you can see Steve and Kathy here and Elon. You know, this has been a -- quite an odyssey the last five, six, seven, eight years -- five years since Bob and I started working on this program, and to be where we are now with the first crewed flight of Dragon is just unbelievable. We've said it before, just a tremendous privilege to be part of this program, to be part of NASA and to spend two months on the International Space Station with one of the greatest officers, crewmates, astronauts, Chris Cassidy just was a real pleasure for both of us. And I'm sure Bob will talk about the spacewalks, but just to see those two work out on the International Space Station, you're not going to see anything like that again. It just was -- it was just amazing to be part of that. And then, you know, the flight of Dragon on Falcon and then the reentry today, it's a lot to process. As I said, five hours ago, we were in a spaceship bobbing around making prank satellite phone calls to whoever we could get a hold of, which was kind of fun, by the way. You can send him the bill for the sat phone. But anyway, we really appreciate all of you coming to say hi and welcoming us back. It's a little bit overwhelming to see everybody here considering the things that have gone on the last few months since we've been off planet. But thank you again for coming to say hi, and hopefully, we'll be able to share a lot of this mission with you in a few months, hopefully, if not sooner. But thank you again.  [ Applause]  Bob Behnken: Well, first of all, thank you for everybody who came out today. I know with all the challenges, everybody is wearing a mask, with the situation that we're in, it's not trivial to get this many people here to try to be close and celebrate what we've accomplished. I think for both Doug and I, the thing that we are most excited about having accomplished with this mission is, you know, it's written right on that sign where it says Launch American, and then, of course, Land America today. As we went through our years as astronauts here at the Johnson Space Center, we got to live through a big chunk of the shuttle era and a big chunk of the assembly of the space station. When the space shuttles retired, when Doug took his final flight to wrap that up, I think it was a sad day for us [inaudible] because there's something special about having that capability to launch and bring your own astronauts’ home. And we went through a lot of years without that capability, and I think we are both super, super proud to have been just a small part of the team that accomplished bringing those spaceflights back to the Florida coast and bringing that capability back to America. As Doug mentioned, we had the luxury of having a -- just a super crew onboard the International Space Station with Chris Cassidy, with Anatoly and Ivan. They just took wonderful care of us. I can't think of anything that we could've had more in place and ready for us when we arrived than what Chris set up for us. And so, we are extremely thankful for him and his work to make things look easy for us. You know, we didn't have the full training template that was out there. We had an abbreviated flow and got to take advantage of an opportunity, if you will, to try to take care of space station as we accomplish this test mission. And so, I think we're both really proud of that and happy that it didn't become a distraction. We were able to accomplish the test mission objectives and work through those, kind of get Dragon certified in some sense to be ready for our return home when the time came to do that. And so, it all just worked out wonderfully. And so, today, when we got the wake-up calls from our boys telling us a little bit about what they were looking forward to, which was us coming home, and in Theo's case getting a new dog, it was a wonderful morning, and we very much appreciated it. And so, again, I think this kind of comes full circle. It took years to get here. We brought the capability back to America, and we came home safely to our families. And it took a lot of people a lot of time to make that happen. And so, to Kathy, thank you for that. Of course, you had Steve as your right-hand man for the most recent history at least, and we definitely really appreciate the hard work that you all had to go through to ensure that the contractors in this case, on the SpaceX team really could understand NASA and what we needed to be able to have in place to have human spaceflight be safe in the way that we wanted to operate it. And I think for the SpaceX team, we couldn't have asked for a more wonderful team to work with. I think, you know, we definitely are old dogs and like some of our old tricks because -- it's not always because lazy. Sometimes it is because we did it before and we know an easy solution, and we try to share that with folks, and that's really -- as we go forward to further activities, whether it's in low-Earth orbit, to the Moon, or beyond, we need to figure out the best way to share what NASA knows with a contractor team and help them be as successful as possible. And I think maybe we weren't there five or six years ago, of course, but by the time we launched, and certainly by the time we returned, I think there was a very tight-knit relationship between the SpaceX team and our NASA team, and we work together to accomplish what we accomplished. So, with that, I just want to thank you all for coming out today and celebrating this victory with Doug and I and recognize our small part of what was accomplished. Thank you all.  [ Applause]  Jim Bridenstine: I've been told I'm not allowed to hold the microphone, and that's really hard for me to do. But I'm going to take my mask off for just a few seconds here and just say thank you to everybody who participated in this. You know, we just saw Bob and Doug, and I think all of us are going to have memories now for the rest of our lives when they launched. In fact, we'll have memories of the day that they didn't launch, and then three days later coming back and doing the whole thing again, not knowing whether or not they were going to go 50/50 on the weather, and then, sure enough, the skies opened up, and we were able to launch Bob and Doug. I want to say a few words just about what champions they are beyond just being the first crew to fly on Dragon. It goes beyond that. They knew that when they were doing this, it was a test flight. They also knew that they were going to be responsible for, you know, conducting a lot of operations on the International Space Station for a period of months to include what ended up being four spacewalks, spending that extended period of time on the International Space Station, and then flying back and amazingly coming off the jet just right now after being weightless for the last 63 days, coming off the jet, sitting down, and doing a public event. And I got to tell you, I've never flown into space, but from my -- that's not normally done. It's very difficult. But they wanted to take that opportunity to connect with the American people on this momentous occasion. And I can't say how -- you just can't put into words how important this was for our country to have access to space again from our own soil. So, again, I know they left, but congratulations to Bob and Doug and their families. What an amazing day for the United States of America. I would also say that what we just saw is the beginning of what will be a whole lot more activity in the future. Right now, when we talk about commercial crew, we're going to go, for the Dragon, we're going to go from development into operations. Of course, we're always going to learn, and we're always going to modify, but making that transition from development to operations is going to be a challenge, but the NASA team is up for it. But it goes beyond that because we still have Starliner, and we need to get Starliner flying, and then we've got to get Orion flying. And we've got to get Starship flying. And we've got to get -- what's that?  Unknown speaker: [Inaudible] a lot of stars.  Jim Bridenstine: A lot of stars -- absolutely. So, look, there is a lot to do in front of us. But here's what we know. We know that when members of Congress come together in a bipartisan way and they fund NASA, amazing things can happen. Right now, we have before the House and the Senate the biggest budget request in NASA's history in nominal dollars. By the way, right now, we have the biggest budget NASA has ever had in nominal dollars. Now, if you look at real dollars, Apollo might have us beat by a little bit, but we're heading the right direction. And next year, if we get the budget request that is before us right now next year, we are going to go up in order of magnitude, and that is necessary because today we're flying into low-Earth orbit, and in a few short years, we want to be flying to the Moon. And not just go once or twice, but we want to go sustainably with a purpose. We're going to the Moon sustainably. We're going to learn how to live and work on another world for long periods of time. We're going to use the resources of the Moon in order to live and work, and we're going to take all of that knowledge onto Mars. That's what we're able to accomplish because of the bipartisan support we've had in the House and in the Senate for the budget that we have right now. And what I'm asking for our members of Congress to do is look at what we've done with what we have, and if you fund us at our budget request level, we will be on the Moon, and we will be successfully on the Moon with our commercial partners and with our international partners. So today was an amazing day. It was a historic day. It's been nine years since America launched and landed from its own soil. And yet here we are. And the next step is we're going on to the Moon and then onto Mars. This is about momentum. It starts today, and it finishes when we put an American flag on Mars. Alright. I've got the honor to introduce somebody who we are very grateful for to help us accomplish this mission. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, NASA seeks to be one customer of many customers in a very robust commercial marketplace in low-Earth orbit. And we want to have numerous providers that compete on cost and innovation and safety. And I will tell you, there was a moment maybe not even a year ago, Kathy Lueders, you can tell me how long ago it was when we had some significant challenges. We might have had a few disagreements on parachutes. We might have had maybe a disagreement on, you know, maybe we need to change the titanium because of its reactivity with nitrogen tetroxide, and I sent a tweet, Elon, and I know you remember this, and since we've had a number of dialogues, I sent a tweet, and I said that it's time to deliver, and I tweeted it at Elon Musk. And I want to tell you, Elon, you responded absolutely magnificently, and you have, in fact, delivered. You have delivered beyond anything any of us would have expected. And I will also say that all of the reports I am getting from all of the teams on commercial crew is that this mission went as good as we could have hoped. And we are so grateful for the team at SpaceX, the great team at NASA's Commercial Crew Program, and all of the operators that helped us to get to this point. So, I just want to say thank you, Elon Musk. The time is yours.  [ Applause]  Elon Musk: Woohoo! Yeah! Thanks, Jim. That -- I mean after these great words that were spoken, I am not sure I have much to add from, you know, Bob and Doug and Jim. But I do think what this heralds really is fundamentally a new era in spaceflight, a new era in space exploration. We're going to go to the Moon. We're going to have a base on the Moon. We're going to have -- send people to Mars and make life multi-planetary. And I think this day heralds a new age of space exploration. That's what it's all about. And this is the result of an incredible amount of work from people at SpaceX, people at NASA.  Hey, Kathy! Hey -- I mean, so much -- 18 years. This has been 18 years to finally fly people to orbit and back. And I really came here because I just wanted to see Bob and Doug to be totally frank. It was like, oh, thank goodness! I think like my entire adrenaline was just dumped, you know. It was like, thank God! Phew! You know? I'm not very religious, but I prayed for this one. So just once again, thanks, everyone at SpaceX, NASA, FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] -- everyone, Air Force, you know, that played a role in this, and key suppliers that did incredible work. Thanks again. And, you know, I think this is something that the whole world can take some pleasure in and can really look at this as an achievement of humanity. And this -- these are difficult times when, you know, there's not that much good news. And I think this is one of those things that is universally good, no matter where you are on planet Earth, this is a good thing. And I hope it brightens your day. Thank you.  [ Applause]  Host: Next, here is the news conference with Behnken and Hurley that occurred two days later. This was the first chance after splashdown for anyone to ask questions to them. So, you will hear the questions that were asked in real-time while I moderated the conference. The crew answers quite a number of them and does a great job of describing riding on Dragon and life aboard station. So, here we go starting with initial remarks from Doug Hurley.  Doug Hurley: Well, it's great to talk to you today. We're just a couple days removed from splashdown off the coast of Florida near Pensacola. Excited to be back. We're already working through our exercise and rehabilitation program to kind of get our Earth legs back. We were lucky that we worked out pretty hard on space station, and I think we've both done pretty well up to this point. We're also lucky in the fact that we landed in some pretty smooth waters thanks to the weather folks, and so I think that helped a lot. Just incredibly excited to be back. Incredibly excited to share the mission with all of you in another way. And just so proud of the SpaceX and NASA teams to get Dragon through its first crewed flight flawlessly. Just -- we're almost kind of speechless as far as how well the vehicle did and how well the mission went and all the things we did onboard ISS with Chris Cassidy and Anatoly and Ivan. So just glad to be back, and it's great to see how excited everybody was for our mission and followed along, and we hope it brings a little bit of brightness to a pretty tough 2020.  Host: Thank you, Doug. We'll now hand it over to Bob Behnken.  Bob Behnken: I think Doug pretty much covered most of the things that either one of us would say about the mission itself. I would just add that, you know, it's a humbling experience to be a part of what was accomplished with the SpaceX vehicle, just a wonderful team on the NASA side and the SpaceX side to pull it all off. It took years in the making. I think Doug and I have been working at it for a good solid five years to get to this point, and it's just awesome to kind of see it to fruition. I know that one of the things that we're most proud of is bringing launch capability back to the Florida coast, back to America, and, of course, landing safely at the end of all of that, and so just, again, humbled to be a part of such an awesome team and awed by what they accomplished.  Host: Thanks to you both for those initial remarks. We'll now open it up for questions. Let's start on our phone bridge first with Loren Grush from “The Verge.”  Loren Grush: Hi, Bob and Doug. Good to talk to you. And congratulations on such a great launch. Leading up to this mission, the date of the launch was always so uncertain, and you mentioned you had planned your life in increments of weeks or months at a time, so I'm wondering how does it feel now after all that build up now that it's over and you have a little more certainty in your schedule again? Thanks.  Doug Hurley: Yeah, that's a good question. I don't know if certainty is the right word at this point. You know, I think for both of us, it still feels pretty surreal. And I know that's a little bit overused, but I don't know how else to describe it. You know, one moment you're bobbing in the Gulf of Mexico, and, you know, less than two days later, you're in a news conference. So, you know, it has been a time to reflect and think about a lot of the things that went on and the lead up to the mission, the mission itself, you know, the launch, the on-orbit time, the entry, the landing, but, yeah, at least we know we're done with the mission, which, you know, we didn't even really know launch dates until just a few months before we launched, and we didn't know the duration of the mission until a few weeks before we came home, and so I guess it's nice in that respect to be back with our family and our friends here at NASA and working through the post-flight activities that we have, and they are pretty well scheduled for the next few weeks for sure. In fact, there's a lot of stuff to do over the next few weeks. So we're hoping at some point just to take some time off and share a little more time with our family since they are the ones that really had to sacrifice over the, as Bob said, over the last five years because we were mostly in California, and we were mostly obviously the last two months in space.  Host: Next, we'll go to Andrea Leinfelder from the “Houston Chronicle.”  Andrea Leinfelder: Thanks, welcome home. Bob, you gave a really great description of what it was like to launch in the Crew Dragon. I was hoping you could give us a similarly vivid account of what it was like to land. Thank you.  Bob Behnken: Well, thank you, Andrea. You know, the landing was -- I would say it was more than what Doug and I expected. Things are always pretty smooth as you work through a deorbit burn because, of course, you are still in low-Earth orbit while you take that little bit energy out that it takes to lower you into the atmosphere and start the trip home. As we kind of descended through the atmosphere, I personally was surprised at just how quickly it all -- the events all transpired. It seemed like just a couple minutes later, after the burn was complete, we could look out the windows and see the clouds rushing by at a much-accelerated rate. You know, one of the things we didn't have a lot of time to do during our time dock to station with how busy we were is to really focus on the Earth for an extended period of time, and during free flight in Dragon we were able to do that, and probably had a pretty good feel for the rate that the Earth was moving below us, and we could definitely tell things were picking up quick after we started that burn. Once we descended a little bit into the atmosphere, you know, Dragon really -- it came alive. It started to fire thrusters and keep us pointed in the appropriate direction. The atmosphere starts to make noise. You can hear that rumble outside the vehicle, and as the vehicle tries to control, you feel a little bit of that shimmy in your body, and our bodies were much better attuned to the environment. So, we could feel those small rolls and pitches and yaws, and all those little motions were things that we picked up on inside the vehicle. As we descended through the atmosphere, the thrusters were firing almost continuously. And I think just the sound that that makes, I did record some audio of it, but it doesn't sound like a machine. It sounds like an animal coming through the atmosphere with all that -- all the puffs that are happening from the thrusters and the atmospheric noise, it just continues to gain magnitude as you descend down through the atmosphere, and I think we both really, really noticed that aspect of things. All the separation events from the trunk separation through the parachute firings were very much like getting hit in the back of the chair with a baseball bat. You know, just a crack, and then you'd get some sort of a motion associated with that. Usually pretty light for the trunk separation, but with the parachutes, it was a pretty significant jolt. And a couple jolts as you go through the dis-reefing of the parachutes as well. And so, all the way down, we were talking about it. I think I took a line from an old movie that Doug and I were both familiar with at one point because, under the g-load of about 4.2 gs, I said, \"Want to get some coffee?\" You know, much like we had seen in an old movie that we had watched because that we really the feeling that we had, and that's the best way to describe it. If you've seen an old movie that happened to have some guys who had been in a centrifuge, that's what we felt like. When the time came to splashdown, I think we were watching the altimeter, which is a GPS altimeter, so it's not super accurate everywhere that you are located, and so we got to below zero for our altitude on that indicator, which was a little bit surprising, and then we felt the splash, and we saw it splash up over the windows. It was just a great relief, I think, for both of us at that point. And I can't say enough at about how well the SpaceX team trained us. You know, they provided us some audio clips of what it was like inside the Demo-1 vehicle so that we were familiar with all those sounds and reassuring is not quite the right word because we think of it more in technical terms as, you know, pilots and engineers riding along with that vehicle, but when it performed as expected, and we could check off those events, we were really, really comfortable coming through the atmosphere even though, you know, it felt like we were inside of an animal.  Host: Let's go to David Kerley from the “Discovery Channel.”  David Kerley: Wow, Bob, what a description. Welcome back to both of you. I have a lot of technical questions, but let's do the fun question and the big question. Bob, did you leave something for Megan? You don't have to tell me what it is. Will SpaceX leave it there? And, Doug, you said you would talk about the historical meaning afterwards. Here we are. Big picture -- what does this mean? Thank you, gentlemen, and welcome home.  Bob Behnken: Well, inside the vehicle, you know, it's not something we don't do is leave things behind. We do our best to, you know, keep it in ship shape. We did leave a patch inside the vehicle. There's a Demo-1 sticker that we added, and we did give the ship a name, Endeavor, and I'm hopeful that they will be able to keep both of those things as they go forward and add their decal to the interior of Endeavor.  Doug Hurley: I guess for me from the historical aspect, I think certainly the first U.S. crewed vehicle since the shuttle, so nine years ago. Certainly, personally, it is significant because I was the last shuttle pilot and then the first commander of Dragon, and so that's -- it's neat to think about now. You know, and I certainly maybe a year from now will think a lot more about it, but I'm more -- I think what is more important to me is the historical aspect for NASA and certainly for SpaceX. It just -- for a company that has only been around for a decade or a little more than that to build a spaceship that takes crew into orbit and returns them safely, just that part of the historical aspect for me is probably most significant. It's just -- and to be part of that, for me, is also by far the most important and one of the most incredible highlights that I'll have from a professional career to just share in that journey, that odyssey, that Endeavor as we named our ship was just one of the true honors of my entire life but certainly my professional career.  Host: We'll now go to Marcia Dunn from “Associated Press.”  Marcia Dunn: Hi. I'm wondering, did either of you realize real-time that you were surrounded by pleasure boats filled with gawkers so soon after splashdown? And if so, were you concerned? And if you were unaware of them, were you surprised to find that out afterward? And, Bob, a real quick question, when is the puppy arriving?  Doug Hurley: Well, I guess since Bob has got a really important question to answer, I'll talk about the boaters. You know this is something that we discussed as a NASA, SpaceX group prior to Demo-1, actually. And, you know, we certainly appreciate the folks wanting to participate in the event. But, you know, there's some safety aspects that I think, you know, as the administrator said we'll have to take a look at because it just can't happen like it did before, but certainly, we were not -- and it's mostly due to kind of the way the windows looked after splashdown, so, you know, the reentry is a fairly dynamic event, and you can see from, you know, just an overall view of the capsule that reentry is a pretty demanding environment, you know, with the different scorches on the vehicle. And the windows were not spared any of that -- to look out the windows, you could basically tell that it was daylight but very little out. So we didn't really see anything clearly out the windows until the SpaceX recovery crews got near us with the fast boats, and then we could see a head or two out the window, but, yeah, I had absolutely no awareness of the other flotilla that was out there until we were back onboard GO Searcher and in the medical facility.  Bob Behnken: Yeah, I just would add a little bit to that, which is folks need to realize we were delayed with actually opening the hatch for an extended period while the teams really made sure that everything was clear and that the vehicle was safe for us to exit and for them to get as many people as required to, you know, perform that extraction for us. And so just a word to the wise for folks who have ideas of coming that close again in the future that we take extreme precautions to make sure it is safe, and we do that for a reason, and hopefully they'll appreciate that, you know, that's required really with us required with spacecraft operations. As far as the puppy goes, we're on about a two-week time frame where we'll -- we need to teach my son a little bit about the things that are required to, you know, have a dog in the house and make sure he's comfortable with picking up his responsibilities associated with the dog. You know, I've done a lot of that with the IP [internet protocol] phone from the space station over the last couple months, but now he has got to put his work in to get the dog bed in the right location and show me that he's ready to take on that responsibility. And, you know, he's going to love that puppy, and he's going to -- and he needs to bring him upright, and so we're going to set him up for success. Otherwise, it'll be my dog instead of his.  Host: Let's go to Robert Pearlman from “collectSPACE.”  Robert Pearlman: Hi, Bob and Doug. Great to see you back on Earth. Up until now after a historic NASA first flight like yours, it would almost be a given that something from the mission, the spacecraft or the spacesuits would be headed to the Smithsonian, but given the commercial nature of your flight, very little of your mission's equipment belongs to NASA, and your spacecraft is already slated to fly again, so were it up to you, what would you like to see SpaceX donate to the National Air and Space Museum or otherwise put on public display? And might we see your sons agree to donate Tremor?  Bob Behnken: Well, they might make that agreement. I'm sure they would request something in trade. I don't know. At least an opportunity to go see where Tremor's new home would actually be. I think there's a lot of Tremors out there as well at this point, and so I think it could be that the marketplace is saturated with Tremors. As far as what I would like to see donated, you know, I still think there's an opportunity for the history to play out and this capsule to still end up in the Smithsonian. You know, it could be used and reused, and then find that permanent home. SpaceX has done a wonderful job. If you've ever visited or seen pictures inside the facility there in Hawthorne, they do have hardware that they've flown or hardware that they've tested and managed to put on public display. Right here, we do have a -- here in Houston at the Space Center Houston, they do have a first stage now that was used, and it's nice to have that in full public view. And I'm sure and confident that they are going to share pieces of the hardware with the public at large. You know, if you go out to Hawthorne, there's a first stage sitting right there on the corner of the property line there, and it's just awesome for people to see that hardware and be able to, you know, recognize it as hardware that was used for space missions, and, you know, take a picture next to it and be a part of it. And so, I know they'll do it. And if it was up to me, I think all of this hardware has a home someplace in the future when it's used up. It's just not used up yet.  Host: Thank you. We're now going to switch to social media for just a second. First of all, you have folks from all over the world on Twitter and Facebook saying hello and congratulations -- Brazil, England, Canada, Argentina, the Netherlands, all over the U.S., just to name a few, but this seems to be a common theme. This one is from Shanika. “Who gets to keep Tremor?”  Doug Hurley: Well, I think we're probably going to go along the lines of I believe it's the NHL where the team that wins the Stanley Cup if you're familiar with that, each member of the team gets to have the Stanley Cup for a day or two, and I think we'll probably work out something along those lines where we just have a, you know, he spends some time at Bob's place, and then he spends some time at our place. And, you know, I think that's fair. And then I think at some point obviously the boys will, you know, they're going to grow up and potentially outgrow Tremor, and, you know, we'll figure out a good, a good place for Tremor as well, just like hopefully with the Endeavor and our suits and anything else that was associated with this mission. It's just a neat memory for Bob and I as fathers, you know, to share this type of thing with our sons, and we're just thankful that we were allowed to take Tremor with us, and it's frankly just amazing to see the response to Tremor and how much people enjoyed that part of the mission along with some of the other things. So, we really appreciate that and thank folks for understanding, you know, that it was important to us.  Host: We'll take one more AskNASA question. This one from Leanne on Facebook asking, “what's the first thing you ate after returning to Earth?”  Bob Behnken: I think for both of us, the first thing we ate was the pizza that they had available on the jet that brought us back into Houston. So, we had a good pizza. We, you know, we've done a lot of travel on the aircraft operation folks here at Johnson Space Center's aircraft over the last 20 years frankly whether it was T-38s or as we responded to COVID and used the larger airplanes to help us get from place to place from a training perspective, and they always have a good plan for taking care of the crews that are onboard and our landing day was no different than the other days. They had us all hooked up and set up, and the pizza was waiting when we made it onboard.  Host: Thank you. We'll now turn to the phone bridge, starting with Eric Berger from “Ars Technica.”  Eric Berger: Hi, guys. I want to congratulate on your excellent timing. Houston in August is lovely. If I may ask a non-Tremor question, were there any surprises during the mission? It all looked so smooth from the launch to the landing, you know, to us watching on the ground. And was it really that perfect? Like did the vehicle perform that well, or was there anything that happened like maybe you went in the capsule on-orbit, and there was a funny odor? Or, you know, something that alarmed you during the two months you were up there? Or was it all just that smooth? Thank you.  Doug Hurley: Frankly, the DM-2 mission part of it as well as the docked ISS mission that we participated in, Expedition 63, but certainly the DM-2 mission, I personally expected there to be more, you know, certainly not issues with the vehicle, but some challenges or some things that were maybe not quite what we expected, I mean even on our shuttle flights, we had things that happened on both of mine, and I know, you know, Bob and I have talked a lot about his missions as well. There were things that happened that were right out of a simulator event and something that you certainly wouldn't have expected in a real flight, but my credit, once again, is to the folks at SpaceX, the production folks, the people that put Endeavor together, and then certainly our training folks, the mission went just like the simulators, and I -- honestly from start to finish, all the way, there was really no surprises, and I think for me personally, I expected the entry to diverge somewhat by what we saw in the simulator, and what I mean by that is as a capsule gets in the thicker air of the atmosphere, so somewhere around 20K, down to maybe 10K, just prior to the drogues with Dragon, I expected there to be some divergence in attitude control because it's a real tough problem for the ship as it gets into the thicker air to maintain perfect attitude and control. And at some point, and then the design of this vehicle is for the drogues to come out potentially a little bit earlier than they nominally would come out to kind of right the vehicle. I fully expected that to happen, and it did not. The vehicle was rock solid right up until the nominal drogue deploy altitude, and as Bob described, you could feel it, you knew exactly, you felt the decel[eration], you knew the drogues both worked, and then it was the same with the mains. We felt the different stages of disreef, and right to the impact in the water, it was, you know, we kind of had a feeling it would be not as much as a Soyuz landing as it was described to us, but it was going to be a pretty firm splashdown, and then, you know, how we bobbed -- even how we bobbed in the water and how the vehicle sat in the water. So, my compliments to SpaceX and the Commercial Crew program. The vehicle performed exactly how it was supposed to. And you feel really good about Crew-1 and what they should expect and what they should see when they fly their mission.  Host: Next is Chris Davenport from “The Washington Post.”  Chris Davenport: Oh, hey, guys. Welcome back. Good to see you. Two quick ones. Just looking for maybe, Bob, a description of what it was like inside Dragon when the heat was building, and that plasma was building. Were you cool? What the view was like? And then maybe, Doug, if you could talk about how many calls you made on the sat phone and who you called? Thanks, bye.  Bob Behnken: You know, as we came through the atmosphere, I think we had a pretty good view out the window until the gs started building, at least for me. My focus kind of shifted towards the display content, and the windows are down by our feet, and so being able to look at those requires kind of head motion and pushing your body around and so just didn't seem like the smartest thing to do, you know, as the vehicle was maneuvering and starting to put gs on to be turning our heads and trying to move around in the seats. At that point, we were trying to make sure that we were good and strapped in. I do feel like I felt some warming of the capsule on the inside, and so the real notice was that when I did get a chance once the gs had come down to look out those windows again, you know, they were obscured as Doug described earlier, and so we kind of saw the clouds racing by and then the g-load started to build up, and we focused on, you know, monitoring the vehicle and paying attention to those small bobbles that we could feel as it controlled the attitude, and then there was not much to see out the windows by the time we had another chance to do it. So --  Doug Hurley: Yeah. And I think -- I'll just add, I had an entry that was a night entry and then a day entry, and it's tough with shuttle even to see the plasma in the daytime. It's almost just this really thin pinkish hue that you could -- in the front seats of the shuttle, you could pick up just very -- it was very difficult to see. So I certainly didn't expect with a full daytime entry like we had with Dragon and then as Bob described the position of the windows relative to where we sit until the seats adjust for the -- basically to get our heads more vertical than our feet after we're under parachutes, you really have to work pretty hard to just see out the windows. And as far as the sat phone, yeah, that probably was a pretty funny to hear that you have astronauts calling whoever we can call. But there was a real reason for it. You know, Nick Hague, when he had his abort onboard Soyuz, they also have a phone where they're able to call folks, but some of the numbers either weren't correct or weren't loaded. And as I think most people know, in this day and age, we know very few phone numbers by heart like we used to know many years ago, and so we wanted to get a test objective out of the way, which was to call the core station at Hawthorne and when we called to say, \"Hey, we would like to do that,\" they said, \"Stand by.\" And so, we decided we would exercise our judgment and use the phone to call some other folks. So, we called Anthony I think at the CAPCOM console -- or at the flight director console here. And, you know, \"Hi, this is Bob and Doug. We're in the ocean.\" And then we also called our wives who happened to be together. I think they were here at mission control, and, of course, they were excited. And as all folks know that have gone through this as a family member, you are kind of helpless until you hear the voice of your loved one on the other end, and this was a great chance to reassure them that we were in the water, we were OK, we were feeling good, and then at that point we were still waiting on SpaceX, and so we just decided to call a few other people that we knew their phone numbers to. And we got a hold of a few, but if anybody has ever used a sat phone, sometimes they work, and sometimes they don't connect. So, it was a -- but it was a very successful test, and we're confident that future crews if they need it, it's a good option for communication.  Host: Next is Stephen Clark from “Spaceflight Now.”  Stephen Clark: Hi, guys. Congratulations on a successful mission, and welcome back to Earth. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to, you know, this by all accounts was a very successful test flight. Just based on your experiences, can I get one of you to comment on if you think Crew Dragon is ready to go for crew rotation missions to the ISS with your successful return? Thanks.  Bob Behnken: You know, I think both of us are in agreement, no questions, that the Crew Dragon, once they finish the certification process, you know, they do need to look at the data from our entry. You know, it's not just the end-user’s anecdotes of how well it performed. They will do a very thorough review both on the SpaceX side and the NASA side to make sure that they're comfortable. But from a crew perspective, I think that it is definitely ready to go. There are things that can be improved, just like even with the final flight of the space shuttle. I know Doug will tell you that there are things that could have been improved or would have been improved if we flew a 136. And so there will be some things that we'll have some ideas about how we could make better to make things a little bit more comfortable or a little bit more efficient inside the vehicle for those crews, but from a crew perspective, I think we're perfectly comfortable saying that Crew-1 is ready when they finish the engineering and analysis associated with certification.  Doug Hurley: One thing I would just like to add about that, you know, Bob and I talked many times over the last couple of years about the duration of the flight, and for a long part of that until just, you know, the -- essentially the beginning of this year, you know, it was going to be the same length as the DM-1 flight, so just a few days in space. And I think, I personally feel a lot better even though there were some challenges dealing with the, you know, the duration of the flight and when all that would come together, I certainly feel much better from the Crew-1 perspective and subsequent flights of having Dragon docked to station for two months is a much better outcome for me than if we had just been up there a few days. If you're asking the Crew-1 folks to be up there for a full up six-month ish-type duration, I think they should have a lot more confidence that the vehicle does fine in the quiescent mode, dock to station, and there wasn't anything that maybe wouldn't have been uncovered had we just been up there for just a few days, so and I thought that was a much better outcome.  Host: We have Gina Sunseri from “ABC News.”  Gina Sunseri: What mission would be on the books for you both next? What would you like to do?  Bob Behnken: At least for me, I think in the short-term is, I transition to a support role. As you know, my wife is assigned to a SpaceX mission, and we have a young son, and so I'll definitely be focused on making sure that her mission is as successful as possible and supporting her just as she did for me over the last five years with the uncertainty in our launch dates and uncertainty in our return dates, it's definitely her turn to focus on getting her mission accomplished while I take care of the things that need to be taken care of for our home life.  Host: Next is Elizabeth Howell from “Space.com.”  Elizabeth Howell: Welcome home. And I wanted to know what kind of lessons learned or kind of advice that you would be giving to the Crew-1 when they get ready to go?  Doug Hurley: That's a great question, and, you know, we have a tag up with those guys I believe early next week, and I think we've mentioned before that we talked to them shortly after launch and once we were docked just to kind of while it was all fresh in our memories, a data relay to all the things that we noticed or saw, sounds, things that really can't be emulated very well in a simulator and things that would trigger, you know, any of the other training objectives that they are going through right now as they wrap up their training. And so, I think lessons learned, you know, there are always lessons learned. You know, things that we did that maybe we could be more efficient about or that we learned or that we thought maybe would work one way or that maybe would work better for another. But generally speaking, I think it's more just relaying the experience and what we did in those particular situations and also trying to at least imagine what it would have been like to have four people in the vehicle rather than two. And we did some docked operation evaluations with four people, and, you know, we had Anatoly and Chris act as the other two crew members, and their vast experience in flying Soyuz and spaceflight in general, they had some great suggestions, and we, at the time, pass those things on in the debrief, and we'll definitely talk to the Crew-1 folks about that as well. But, yeah, there's a very formal process and then an informal process, and we'll just try to pass on everything that we've learned and what we think might work the best with a crew of four.  Host: We have Joey Roulette from “Reuters.”  Joey Roulette: Thanks for doing this. And, Bob, I really appreciate that description of descending in Crew Dragon you gave earlier in the call, and I was wondering, do you think there's anything SpaceX can or should do to make Crew Dragon's descent calmer, or is that the way it should be? And is that what you expected? Thanks.  Bob Behnken: I think from a crew perspective, you know, really, what is important is that you understand the events that the vehicle is going to go through and know what to expect. And so the thing that I found most valuable having gone through that experience was something that actually the launch team put together for us, pulled together some ascent video from both Demo-1 and the abort test that they performed to show what the sounds in Dragon were synced up with the video feed. And so being able to watch that and hear the sounds and see what they corresponded to on the video from, you know, the outside tracking cameras that were in place was just invaluable from my perspective and really understanding what the vehicle was going to be going through and be comfortable as we went through it and monitor it appropriately. And so, you know, both Doug and I had confidence like we described earlier that, you know, the drogues had come out, and that the reefing had happened according to schedule just based on being able to watch that video and hear the sounds and have it all synced up. We just knew what to expect. You know, this maybe sounds a little bit boring, and I'm going to get probably some flak from talking about movie clichés again, but, you know, there's a movie “Groundhog Day,” where they're sequencing through and everything is predictable, and for dynamic events like a spaceflight for ascent and for entry, it really is invaluable as you try to control your body and come through that environment whether it's a g-loading or it is the dynamics of a pitch, yaw, and roll moving you around inside the vehicle, knowing what to expect really sets you up for success to work your way through it and do anything that you might need to do in those dynamic situations, and I think that video that the SpaceX team put together was just wonderful, and I watched it again on orbit before we came home, and I know that will be in our list of things that we recommend to the Crew-1 guys if they haven't already watched it that that's something that they should kind of commit to memory and consider even having available on orbit.  Host: Next is Morgan McFall from “Business Insider.”  Morgan McFall: Hi, Bob and Doug. Welcome home, and thanks so much for taking my question. I'm wondering what you would most like to see for the partnership between NASA and SpaceX going forward, and what are you most excited about in this new era of human spaceflight? Thank you.  Doug Hurley: Well, it is neat to see SpaceX is in the competition to build the lunar lander with two other companies. And we've had, as an agency, we've had a wonderful partnership with SpaceX, you know, from commercial cargo to commercial crew, and they just continue to work towards the goal of getting humanity out into the cosmos, and it's been a great relationship. It has been very beneficial for both SpaceX and for NASA, and this, once again, the success of DM-2 proves that it should be something that we should continue, and I am excited to see that happen. It was a lot of work to get from where we started five years ago to now, but it is just -- they are a wonderful company to work with, and they have some incredibly talented people, and I think there is plenty to come from the relationship that NASA and SpaceX have.  Bob Behnken: Yeah, from my perspective, it really is critical that we continue to try to build on that relationship that Doug has referred to. You know, it won't be appropriate if we take the next step, which is to restart with a different NASA team and a different SpaceX team. We really need to leverage those relationships and continue with all the, you know, the five years of experience that we have of figuring out the things that NASA can best share with SpaceX to make them as successful as quickly as possible, and, you know, that applies to all the partnerships that NASA sets up is figuring out the best way to communicate and share information is how we're going to all cooperate to get to our end objective. And so, I just am really excited as we go forward that the relationships and the work that's -- the groundwork that is in place is going to be leveraged to accomplish even more great things in the future.  Host: We'll take one from Mark Carreau from “Aviation Week.”  Mark Carreau: Wondering what the primary question you're getting from your astronaut colleagues is and what you're telling them about the experience?  Doug Hurley: Actually, we haven't had a ton of interaction with anybody given that, you know, when you get back from space you have a pretty compromised immune system to some degree, so we're taking every precaution that we can to try to stay away from most folks although there is a lot of medical testing and rehabilitation that's going on, but there will be time to do debriefs, and I think, as I mentioned before, certainly with the Crew-1 folks coming up here pretty shortly, but, yeah, we haven't seen a lot of them because, you know, we're just in the stage of the pandemic where we're still I think-- even the folks that are -- haven't gone to space are trying to distance and wear masks and those kinds of things, but we definitely know that there are a lot of questions. We have certainly gotten a lot of texts and emails, and hopefully, we can describe everything from memory that is pertinent. And as Bob said, you know, SpaceX will certainly have a synced-up video with audio for our ascent as well as our entry that will be passed on for multiple crews for them to use.  Bob Behnken: I would say we are still the phase where all of our astronaut colleagues aren't asking us for information. They know now is not the time for that. They're asking us do we need anything, are our families well taken care of, are we in good shape, and so that's their primary focus right now is, you know, taking care of the team, which is the astronaut office, and so I -- all the well wishes that come in are, \"Do you need anything?\" \"Is there -- don't climb a ladder. I'll change the light at your house.\" All those sorts of things and it has just been wonderful how many folks have reached out to try to, you know, make sure that we're well taken care of after the mission that we just went through. And it's like that for every mission when crews come back.  Host: We'll now go to social media for a few more questions there using hashtag #AskNASA. This one comes from Natalie on Twitter. “What is the reconditioning process like to get reacquainted with gravity?”  Doug Hurley: Well, we'll spend two hours every day with our strength and conditioning specialists. And it is essentially just a walk before you run literally type process. We do some stretching. We do some aerobic exercise. We do some lifting and some agility drills. And it's -- you're pretty tired after the two-hour process, and we just started it yesterday, so on Day 2, and it will continue for roughly 45 days. And most people really adjust in that time, certainly before you get to 45 days, but it is a continuous process to get you right back to where you were pre-flight.  Host: We'll take one more from social media. This one from Leo on Twitter. “What is the greatest lesson that a young person can learn from this mission, especially in these challenging times?”  Bob Behnken: I think the greatest lesson folks can take from our experience is one of perseverance. You know, Doug and I didn't get to this opportunity, and this team didn't get to this success without years of hard effort, you know, challenges along the way. It doesn't -- doing something complicated like developing a new spacecraft and launching it, developing a new rocket and then putting a spacecraft on top of it and launching it to the International Space Station is just a -- it's a tremendous level of effort that is required to accomplish that. And it is -- there are setbacks. There are challenges where, you know, a rocket performance isn't what you expected, or a propulsion system onboard a capsule isn't exactly everything that you thought it was, and you have to adapt to those challenges, and you have to overcome them and continue forward and maintain both optimism and paranoia as you go through that perseverance. And so those are all normal things as you try to accomplish, you know, challenging tasks, and so I'm hopeful that our experience, the entire SpaceX team's experience, and the NASA team's experience, one of just the focused effort for an extended period of time, you know, can lead to just awesome results if you stay focused, and so that message of perseverance is the one that I would want to share.  Host: We'll now go back to the phone bridge, starting with Marina Koren from “The Atlantic.”  Marina Koren: Hi, Bob and Doug. Welcome back. What advice would you give to future Crew Dragon passengers who are not astronauts? And a quick second question, you've been close friends for years, did your friendship survive this historic experience?  Doug Hurley: Alright. What advice would we give kind of the non-professional astronaut when they are flying on Crew Dragon? Purely that the SpaceX and NASA collaborated to build a tremendous vehicle that is very capable of the mission to go to and from low-Earth orbit safely. It's a comfortable vehicle. There are things that are just an aspect of flying in space that I think most folks don't quite realize or understand. There are times when it's uncomfortable. There are times when, of course, you can't take a shower. You know, going to the bathroom is a challenge. But I think in general, it's an outstanding vehicle, and they should be excited to fly onboard to get that experience if they're lucky enough to do it. And I think as far as our friendship, it certainly survived. If anything, it just got stronger. You know, being part of a crew with Chris and Anatoly and Ivan, it was just neat to see the team developed. You know, as Bob had mentioned before and I'm sure I did too, we have known Chris for a long time. I flew with Chris on our first flight together, and it just was really neat to see the Expedition 63 crew develop and work through the last few months, and it was very, very rewarding. And I think for me personally, maybe I didn't appreciate that aspect of it as much, you know, going into the flight because I think, you know, our huge concern and challenge was making sure DM-2 flew the way it ended up flying successfully. And so, it was neat, and it just was such a huge advantage I think for Bob and I that we are close friends that just the crew coordination part of it and flying Dragon was almost via telepathy sometimes. You know, we didn't even have to say anything whether we were pointing at something or if we just at that particular moment looking at that part of a display because that's what we knew would be the thing that was most important, and I just think that, you know, I know that doesn't necessarily always go into the selection process, but I think, you know, in this case, when we were selected to fly this mission together, it certainly gave us a distinct advantage over some crews. And it was certainly very much appreciated by me.  Bob Behnken: Yeah, just as Doug said, being able to add Chris to our friendship and Anatoly and Ivan is really how Expedition 63 worked out. You know, it was -- us focused on the mission. And Chris, as the commander of the space station, being able to shift into the support role when it came time for us to get docked and then us to shift into our support roles once we were onboard the space station, of course, the spacewalk activities have various sync points where kind of the leadership kind of moves around, and we were able to do that very seamlessly, and part of that is, you know, related to just how close and how strong our friendships were kind of across the board. And so -- and, of course, when we came to the end of the mission, and it was time to undock, Chris jumped back into that support role again and helped us with the cargo transfer that we needed to put in place, some of the powered payload activities. We just -- it was all very seamless. Folks understood what their responsibilities were, and we were able to, you know, cooperate and work together to make it all happen and get the mission done. And so, I would say, you know, our friendship is stronger, and we added some folks to our circle as well.  Host: Next is MaryLiz Bender from “Cosmic Perspective.”  MaryLiz Bender: Welcome home, Bob and Doug. I want to first thank you for sharing that wisdom on perseverance. You shared a lot of stunning images of Earth while you were on the station, and I really enjoyed the perspective you gave with the captions that you used. And I just wanted to ask, what compelled you to share so much, and what was your favorite location or feature to photograph?  Doug Hurley: Well, I think we can both answer that one. You know, for me, I just -- every time you look out the window of the space station, and certainly, we didn't get the opportunity that I thought we were going to get, you know, based on the description of previous crew members. Our time was used up a lot to make up for the fact that, you know, we were down to three crew members on the space station prior to us getting there, and I think -- and rightly so, the International Space Station Program needed us to get to work right off the bat. But the time that we did get to do that, you know, the perspective that you have from low-Earth orbit of our planet is just one of just complete awe of, first of all, how beautiful the planet is and that there are no borders that you can see from space, that the atmosphere is so thin, and then literally every time you look out the window, you see something different and even more beautiful than the last thing you saw the last time you looked out the window, and it's always different. And maybe more so this year than in past years that astronauts have taken photographs out the window, you know, the country, the United States, and the world has been dealing with so much chaos and drama and the pandemic, and all the things that have been going on in the world and, you know, if it were me, it would make me feel better to see these pictures from space, and so I think we just felt like it was a way to maybe have folks maybe have a distraction for a while and also to appreciate the planet that we've been given. You know, it is unique in that standpoint, and it is just beautiful to look at. And it's -- I personally feel it's our obligation to share what we see because not everybody is going to get to go to space and to just bring as much of the experience to everybody back on Earth is something I thought was very, very important.  Bob Behnken: You know, I think for both of us, we didn't expect to have a longer duration mission. We expected to have just a few short days, which would've really limited our opportunity to share the station life aspects or the things that you can see from low-Earth orbit or from the space station with folks. And when we got the opportunity for a longer mission, I think we both wanted to take advantage of that. You know, I think the Earth below us is a wonderful view -- just some amazing things to see. I'm a little bit -- I'm a physics-trained engineer background sort of a thing, and so I was really interested in the things that were examples of science or engineering or just physics below us or above us that was happening. And so whether it was lights shimmering across the ocean surface or it was sunrises or sunset in trying to figure out how to get a photo and share that so that somebody else could have the same wonder that we have when we get a chance to see it ourselves was what was really important to me. We had some interesting, you know, conditions during the flight. We had a period of time where we were in continuous daylight. We got to do a spacewalk in continuous daylight, which was just crazy to imagine, you know, being outside the entire time with the sun up the entire time. It was just a strange thing to kind of get your mind around, and we got to have that experience. And so, as a part of that, I think it took away the opportunities for us to get as many shots of the Comet NEOWISE that was rising. It kind of came in that same period. So, we had too much light to be able to see it very much. But just all those things that you can see whether it's lightning or the cities at night or look out at the Milky Way and see the stars in the background, or just see the glow of the Earth and see that it is not dark even at night compared to the darkness of space is just imagery that we wanted to share and maybe spark an interest of the wonder that we were able to see and whether it's a child or an adult that's out there so that in this year and in years in the future, folks can look at that and be inspired to have the kind of careers that we have had or, you know, chase a different dream than the one that we have chosen.  Host: Next is Irene Klotz from “Aviation Week.”  Irene Klotz: Thank you. I realize you're still digesting all of this, but if you -- if the decision were up to you about when to fly friends, family, other non-professional astronauts, do you think that the system is mature enough after just perhaps another two flights to have that kind of mission?  Doug Hurley: That's a good question. I think if it were me and it was a family member, certainly, as Bob described, there's a certification process that Endeavor hasn't completed yet, and it'll likely be weeks, and I think from my experience of flying fighters and testing fighters, you know, a first flight, there's a lot of scrutiny on a first flight, and there's a lot of work that goes into a first flight, but you can't let your guard down, and you've got to take a look at the data. You've got to listen to the hardware, and it is probably going to take a few flights because, you know, we certainly did our best, and I think the teams did their best to script this flight to be a full up test flight, but there are certainly things on Dragon that could be tested more. And there -- just for an example, you know, we dock to the forward part of the space station. There's certainly the likelihood that a Dragon is going to have to dock to a different docking port, either the Zenith -- I think it's the Zenith port that is likely to be next for a commercial vehicle. And that may sound somewhat insignificant, but it isn't, and so all the software that needs to go into the vehicle trajectory analysis and the things that they need to do in order to make that possible, and for our flight that was not possible. The software hadn't been written yet to do that docking port, so just things like that -- so I think it's going to take few flights before, and I think that's prudent, a few flights before we can consider this vehicle completely tested, and then as we all know, you know, the space business like a lot of those technically challenging businesses is not forgiving. So, the bigger thing to take a look at is to just not let your guard down and don't just assume because the last flight went perfectly that the next flight is going to go perfectly. You have to do that rigor and that analysis and that attention to detail, and you can't get complacent, and you can never get complacent with a space vehicle.

        description: "Production Transcript for Ep27_ The Search for Life.mp3     [00:00:00] >> Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 27, The Search for Life.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  So this is the podcast where we bring in the experts -- NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts -- all to tell you the coolest information about NASA and about space.  So today we're talking about something super cool, how we're looking for life in the universe.  We're talking with Aaron Burton and Marc Fries.  Aaron and Marc are both planetary scientists here at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.  And we had a great discussion about the different NASA initiatives all looking at organic material in the solar system and what we're finding from these studies that help us understand the fundamentals of life here on Earth and possibly in the universe.  So with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right into our talk with Dr. Aaron Burton and Dr. Marc Fries.  Enjoy.    [00:00:50] [ Music ]    [00:00:57] >> T minus five seconds and counting.  Mark.    [00:01:05] >> [Inaudible] there she goes.    [00:01:06] >> Houston, we have a podcast.    [00:01:08] [ Music ]    [00:01:14] >> Well, this one's going to be good because -- I'm excited because this one's about the ultimate question, right?  Are we alone in the universe?  That's literally -- I mean, it's in the NASA mission statement, right?  Everything we do is to explore the unknown and -- reveal the unknown for the benefit of humankind or something like that.  So I guest I'll start off with this question: How many times a day do you ask yourself that question, \"Are we alone?\"    [00:01:40] [ Laughter ]    [00:01:42] >> Well, it's back there, you know, squirrel caging around somewhere all the time.    [00:01:46] >> Yeah.    [00:01:46] >> I don't know if I stop in, like, the middle of shaving and go, \"Wait a minute, but are we alone?\"    [00:01:51] [ Laughter ]  But, you know, I do think about it on a regular basis, sure.    [00:01:54] >> I figure, well, because that's the whole thing, right?  This is your job.  Your job is to look for organic material, right?  So I guess to just pull back.  And I just think that would be super cool, are we alone or -- you know, that's not bad.    [00:02:06] >> You know, I'd say I think about it more at night.  Well, when you look up at the stars and you just see all of the stars.    [00:02:13] >> Okay.    [00:02:13] >> That's just what we can see.    [00:02:15] >> Yeah, exactly.    [00:02:16] >> So the thought that we're the only game in town seems a pretty -- pretty unlikely.    [00:02:21] >> Yeah.  I just took a camping trip out to Big Bend a couple weeks ago.  And that was just an eye-opener.  Because I thought I had seen, \"Wow, there's a lot of stars in the sky,\" you know, when I was living in Pennsylvania.  But out in Big Bend you can see the Milky Way.  And there's constellations where you couldn't even see them because there was just that many more stars.  It was just the clearest sky I've ever seen in my life.  I was like, \"Wow, this is just -- from a different part of Earth I can see this many stars.\"  It was crazy.  All right.  Well, so let's start off with just a little bit about you guys and since you're both planetary scientists kind of what your focuses are.    [00:02:59] >> Okay.  Yeah.  So I have built a research lab where we look for organic molecules that we find in meteorites.  So these are carbon-containing molecules.  And I'm interested in the ones that are related to biology.  So things that biology could use.  And so by looking at the organic molecules that are found in meteorites, that gives us a way to look at samples where biologically interesting molecules are made but they weren't made by life.  They were just made by sort of abiotic chemistry, things that can happen in our solar system.  And so I'm interested in doing that because I want to know about the chemistry that was going on before life started.  And then from understanding that chemistry, try and take the next step forward to think of if we know the chemistry that was going on without life, how did that transition into a living system that we have?    [00:03:53] >> Wow.  Literally the origins of life.    [00:03:56] >> Yeah.    [00:03:56] >> That's pretty cool.  How about you, Marc?    [00:03:59] >> I work in curation.  I'm a scientist in curation.  And then curation I should explain.  We basically take care of NASA's collections.  We have the Apollo moon rock collection, we have meteorites from Antarctica, we have samples from -- delivered by a couple sample return missions.  And all the curators, all the curation scientists are expected to have a scientific interest as well and maintain a scientific course of study.  What I study is carbon in geological systems, not necessarily just organic chemistry.  Aaron's much more of a specialist in that, much more of an expert in that than I am, per se.  But more of carbon in entire systems ranging from, you know, gas phase carbon that you find in rocks, whether it's biological or geological carbon is part of a system on planetary surfaces and interiors and such.    [00:04:54] >> But it's fair to say, you know, carbon is an essential component of life, right?    [00:05:00] >> As far as we know, yes.    [00:05:01] [ Laughter ]    [00:05:02] >> That's true.  There's a bunch of other things, you know, that we can talk about.  I don't know -- I don't know if you guys actually discuss silicon-based life forms or anything like that or --    [00:05:12] >> Yeah, I --    [00:05:12] >> -- I would say carbon.  Carbon's usually the good stuff, right?  That's the basic form of life.    [00:05:18] >> Yeah.  So at the most simple aspect you have carbon, and we like it because it make four bonds.  So you can make these long polymers out of it.  And so if you just go down the periodic table, silicon, well, that does, you know, similar things.    [00:05:31] >> Right.    [00:05:32] >> But carbon's actually pretty special.  So if you compare carbon and silane or methane and silane -- so metaion is CH4, silane is SIH4.  You know, those would be sort of the analogous molecules.  By silane actually is, like, an incredibly explosive gas.  And it's very difficult to keep on Earth, whereas methane, you know, sort of hangs around and gets produced.  So that works out well for organisms that produce methane and for life.  And then if you start looking at other things like CO2 as a gas, that's what we breathe in and breathe out, you know, trees use that for photosynthesis.  If you compare that SIO2, you know, that's --    [00:06:14] >> It's a rock.    [00:06:15] >> [Laughs] Yeah, that's a --    [00:06:15] >> Kind of hard to breathe rock.    [00:06:17] >> [Laughs] Yeah, it's -- yeah.  So it's hard to breathe.  It's not very easy for organisms to process it or to access it.  And so, you know, it ends up being just a less mobile sort of building block.  If you're whole life was centered around silicon, now it's all sand, right?    [00:06:34] >> Yeah, a little harder.  So carbon is just the magic ingredient, really, just because that ability to bond to so many things.    [00:06:43] >> Yeah, at least based on physics in our solar system.    [00:06:48] >> Well, so, you know, the whole just concept of life, searching for life, right?  I mean, there's a lot of things that we study out in the universe, but this quest to find life outside the solar system, why is that so fundamental to us as humans, to go out and to search for it?    [00:07:06] >> It's a good question, kind of hard to answer because it's just kind of -- best answer I could give is that it's just a fundamental question.  I mean, anybody's who's looked up at night, like Aaron said, has had to wonder.  You know, there's an awful lot of stuff up there.  Surely there's got to be something else.  It's just a basic, almost primal human query.  I don't know how to put it any better than that, honestly.    [00:07:34] >> Yeah.    [00:07:35] >> Yeah.  I mean, I think it's kind of like the human tradition of exploring.  And, you know, first it started out, you know, humans on a land mass.  And they said, \"Well, what's on the other side?  You know?  What's over those mountains?\"    [00:07:46] >> Right.    [00:07:47] >> What's across that river?  And then expanded to what's across that ocean?  And then what's at the bottom of the sea floor?  And now, you know, what's on the next world over?  And, you know, it's kind of that exploring but also then, you know, if we're asking these questions, is there anyone else out there that's asking those same questions?    [00:08:06] >> Yeah.  That's true.  I mean, if you think about human history, just the fact that people travel, they find a new civilization and can open up new trade routes.  Or even as far as cross the Atlantic Ocean and discover a whole new world trying to find more trade routes or something like that.  So it's just -- I guess you're right, it's kind of built into our DNA that we just have this drive to -- it's not enough, right?  We want to -- we want to know.  We want to know why.  We want to know more.    [00:08:33] >> Yeah.  You look at the sky and you say, \"I'm pretty sure there's life out there.  but I want to sort of prove it.\"  You know?    [00:08:37] >> Yeah.    [00:08:38] >> I want to find it, actually know.    [00:08:40] >> Pretty sure is not good enough [Laughs].    [00:08:42] >> Luckily humans have a low fascination threshold.    [00:08:46] [ Laughter ]    [00:08:48] >> So -- so I mean, just besides the fascinating of it, why is it important to understand the origins of life?  You know, what can we get out of it?    [00:08:59] >> Well, for me, you know, I've just been interested, I guess, from the scientific standpoint of, you know, how does life start?  Which I think naturally leads to could life exist elsewhere?  And so those are two kind of the basic questions.  Because if life could exist elsewhere, then that answers your sort of fundamental, intrinsic question of is there life elsewhere?  If you know how it started, then you know what signs to look for, what kinds of environments you need to look in, what types of chemistry needs to be going on for you to look there for life.    [00:09:34] >> So how does just -- you know, once you do that, you know, I guess you can help you search for life outside, but what about here on Earth?  You know?  Is there applications for, you know, learning more about how the origins of life and how that comes to be?  How can that help us here?    [00:09:51] >> See, I would answer that by saying that, you know, fundamentally we're answering -- it's like we said, like [inaudible] talked about just a minute ago, this understanding the origin of life is one of primal fundamental human queries that most people want to know.  And as scientists, our goal, our purpose is to discover exactly that sort of thing, to try to answer those sort of questions, to be the interpreters of the world around us, to try to enrich everyone's lives.  And that's a really important thing that a lot of people are interested in.  So it's a high priority for scientific investigation.  For a more nuts and bolts approach, you know, maybe understanding the fundamentals of how life arose would give us better understanding into our own biochemistry at a very fundamental level.  That's a possibility.    [00:10:49] >> Improving life for us, you know, making life better for humans.  Just however -- you know, bring it into industry, make better drugs or understand how, you know, people grow up or develop.  You know, just life, right?    [00:11:03] >> The fundaments of how a cell functions on the chemical level.  It can't be bad to know more about that.    [00:11:11] >> [Laughs] Well, talking to --    [00:11:13] >> I would --    [00:11:13] >> Oh, go ahead.    [00:11:14] >> Sorry.  So I would just add that a lot of what origins of life researchers try to do is sort of recreate how life could have started.  You know, ideally if you had a time machine, you would just go back in time 4.5 billion years --    [00:11:28] >> Oh, that would be easy [Laughs].    [00:11:29] >> -- to the start of life.  But it raises a philosophical issue, which is what if you disrupted that process and so you actually killed life?  So maybe that's a bad idea.  But, you know, without a time machine we don't have to worry about that.  But the best we can hope to do is sort of recreate how life started or how life could have started.  And so a lot of the experiments that have gone on in there have looked at sort of alternatives to DNA.  And so these alternatives to DNA have actually been shown to not be recognized by sort of modern biology.  So you can make sort of a drug out of this alternative DNA that now has a longer lifespan inside of a human.  You know?  So it's kind of expanded the range of drugs that are accessible and kind of opened up or helped contribute to the field of synthetic biology where we can start, you know, doing gene manipulation, genetic therapies.  So there really are practical applications of it in addition to satisfying our kind of curiosity about how life started.    [00:12:32] >> Just out of curiosity, these studies, are there any going on, on the International Space Station right now that have to do with sort of understanding life and how the origins or maybe just how it affects humans?    [00:12:44] >> Well, yeah, every astronaut that we send up there is sort of an experiment on how --    [00:12:48] >> There you go.    [00:12:49] >> -- how environmental conditions are affecting life and biology.  But there's also exposures.  So they put microorganisms on the outside of the ISS, for example, and then expose them to radiation, that sort of thing, bring the organisms back.  So that's kind of, you know, an emerging field, too.    [00:13:10] >> Wow.  All right.  So we talked a lot about the why of -- why search for life and all of that.  But let's pull back and just kind of understand just what we're talking about here.  So how -- as one of the experts in the field of understanding life and studying life, how would you define life, Aaron?    [00:13:28] >> That's a good question [Laughs] that people have actually really wrestled with.    [00:13:33] >> Really?    [00:13:33] >> It's not an easy one to answer.  So the origins of life community has settled on a sort of mouthful, which is that life is a self-sustaining chemical system that is capable of Darwinian evolution.  And so, you know, there's a lot in there.    [00:13:52] >> Yeah, yeah.  That makes sense.    [00:13:53] >> But self-sustaining means something that can actually reproduce itself and grow, not necessarily grow in size but grow in population.  So if you have one molecule and now it can make, you know, ten more, etc. and continue to reproduce.  But it's also important that it be able to actually change over time.  And that's where the Darwinian evolution comes in.  So if you have, you know, a salt crystal that's made up of sodium and chloride, and you can add more sodium and chloride to that salt crystal and it's getting bigger, so it's growing in some sense.  There are more sodiums and chlorides in there.  But it doesn't really change.  Right?  So we would never call a salt crystal alive, even though it can, you know, grow.  It's a chemical system.  So you really need that capacity to change for an organism to be able to do something different and to sort of respond to its environment.  That's a very technical --    [00:14:43] >> It makes sense, right?  You got to check those boxes.  Because otherwise if you do the wrong definition, you know, salt is life now.  So [Laughs].    [00:14:46] >> Yeah.    [00:14:46] >> You'll get that salt life sticker on the back of your car.    [00:14:48] [ Laughter ]    [00:15:00] >> Yeah.    [00:15:01] [ Laughter ]    [00:15:02] >> Totally different thing.    [00:15:03] >> Very funny.  Yeah.    [00:15:04] [ Laughter ]    [00:15:05] >> That's awesome.    [00:15:05] >> So then for you, Marc, I guess you're studying carbon specifically, right?  So then how does that fit into the picture of understanding life?    [00:15:15] >> It kind of goes to what Aaron was saying about understanding the chemical conditions at the origin of life.  There's a fun conundrum there, actually, in that okay, we know that life arose on Earth and -- but it's basically being able to get directly at the conditions where that happened is very, very difficult because of ironically life itself.  Life has basically overprinted everything on the planet.  Whatever conditions it was that gave rise to life on Earth, you know, they might be here today, there might be something in the deep ocean, there's all manner of hypotheses about this, but it's very, very difficult to pin that down because life has altered this planet so -- so completely.  I mean, from the mantle to the surface, to the top of the atmosphere, chemically, morphologically, isotopically, everything has been changed.  And so trying to get back at that original set of conditions that gave rise to life is actually really difficult here on Earth.    [00:16:16] >> Wow.  Is it -- is it, you know, postulated more that life itself started on Earth and then just sort of spread and literally changed the makeup of the Earth, or is there some chance that maybe, you know, it came from somewhere else and maybe just got delivered to Earth or something?    [00:16:34] >> I don't like that --    [00:16:36] [ Laughter ]  Here's the reason I don't like that, is the notion of life coming from somewhere else.  Just from the sake of samples that it doesn't actually answer the question of how life arose; you just moved it somewhere else and put an almost impossible journey in between the origin and its evolution on Earth.  We know that the Earth has been changed considerably by life.  We have oxygen in our atmosphere because of it.  I guess that's off on a tangent a bit.    [00:17:07] >> Please go if you need to.    [00:17:09] [ Laughter ]    [00:17:12] >> Yeah.  So fundamentally that's my problem with saying that it started somewhere else and came here.  Because that you are introducing a big complication to it without really putting any light on how it happened.    [00:17:25] >> Yeah.    [00:17:26] >> Yeah.  As Marc was saying, you know, we think life started in water on a rocky body somewhere.  So whether that's Earth, or Mars, or, you know, somewhere else, you still need life to start on a rocky body with water somewhere.  So, you know, speculating that it was Mars and then it got transported here doesn't -- from a practical standpoint doesn't help you address, you know, those conditions necessarily any better.    [00:17:54] >> Well, still, I mean, narrowing it down to, you know, we could say you need a rocky body with water for it to at least start, right; is that at least a starting point for understanding the origins life?    [00:18:06] >> I think it is.  That's a good distillation.  There's another interesting little conundrum in there.  Aaron mentioned Mars.  And I was just talking about how Earth has been completely overprinted.  There's a lot of interest in trying to find life on Mars.  And that's fine, that's good.  But there's kind of a -- a hidden value to a completely dead Mars.  Let me go off on a little bit of a tangent here.    [00:18:39] >> Please do.    [00:18:40] >> Let's say that life started on Earth and that Mars, even though it had all the conditions for life -- apparently water, fairly warm, fairly dense atmosphere -- never had life.  If that's the case, then basically Mars has preserved in a kind of mummified state those conditions early in the formation of the terrestrial planets when life arose on Earth.  So one of the fun conundrums here is that a completely dead Mars with no history of life may give us -- may be a very powerful tool to understanding the origin of life on Earth.    [00:19:15] >> Huh.  So that's where the many rovers that we've sent to Mars over the year come into play, right?  We're studying Mars and trying to understand its history to see what we can learn about its past and see if what you're saying is true.  Maybe -- maybe the atmosphere was -- was thicker.  Maybe there was water.  And all of these instruments that we're sending there are the things that are finding all of this out.    [00:19:39] >> That's right.  Narrowing down that history.    [00:19:41] >> Yeah.    [00:19:42] >> And looking -- and trying to answer the question of whether there is or was life on Mars.  That's an important part of it.    [00:19:48] >> All right.  Well, understanding Mars and the different, you know, rovers we've sent there to study that -- you said you were part of the curation facility.    [00:19:56] >> Yes.    [00:19:56] >> So -- and you said all the different things that are there, right?  So you're talking about meteorites and moon rocks.  Are there hints there that maybe can points towards the origin of life?    [00:20:07] >> Right.  So amongst the samples we have are samples of Mars.  You know, they come to us as meteorites.  The -- here at NASA we curate -- we partner with the Smithsonian to curate the Antarctic meteorite collection.  We have a very large number of meteorites from Antarctica.  There is a team called ANSMET, the Antarctic Search for Meteorites, which goes every year and collects more of them.  Actually, the team for that left into the field to go start their annual search -- I believe it was two days ago.  They just started off.    [00:20:40] >> All right.    [00:20:40] >> So we get these meteorites every year.  And they include periodically Martian meteorites.  To date, you know, not just the NASA collection, but all the collections in the world, we have on the order of -- well, in excess of a quarter of a metric ton of Mars meteorites.  We have samples of Mars that date back to billions of years old or as young as ten of millions of years old.  We have samples that have come from evidently only a meter deep to ten meters deep or so, others that were solidified in place like a kilometer deep, much deeper than that.  There's this random sampling from all over the planet.  Here's where I say the thing that a lot of people don't like to hear and that I am fairly -- there's a wide range of opinion about -- in the scientific community onto whether or not there's been life on Mars, is life on Mars?  I'm fairly convinced by the meteorite evidence that there is not life on Mars, nor has there been.   [00:21:45] Because in all those meteorites that we have from all over the surface, all manner of depth, all through a wide range of history is this neat random sampling all over the planet, we have yet to see any evidence -- any conclusive evidence of any metabolizing in those rocks.  And that tell us that not just today but for a very long period through the past that these meteorites have witnessed that nothing has lived in them.  I think that that's a fairly compelling result.  It's not the final say, but yeah.    [00:22:19] >> Yeah.  Guys, it's kind of interesting because you say Martian meteorites.  But, you know, to an average Joe like me, I would ask the question how does -- how does a piece of Mars get delivered to Earth?    [00:22:33] >> Right.  Well, the solar system's a wild, unruly place with a lot of things that run into each other.  You know, basically take a look at Mars and you see impact craters all over it.  What happens is a meteorite falls onto Mars, or the moon, or other asteroids and they spall material off in an energetic high-speed event known as an impact and kick material clean off the planet basically.  And this stuff, you know, winds up in orbits across the Earth's orbit and fall to Earth.  And we find them -- they fall -- meteorites fall all the time.  The reason why these guys, ANSMET, goes to Antarctica is because they tend to concentrate in places where they're easier to find there.  There are literally places in the Antarctic ice sheet where the only rock you'll see is something that fell there.  And so they can go out and collect these things there.  And that's the process.  There's an impact at the beginning, a long period in the vacuum of space, a fall to Earth through a fireball which destroys most of the meteorite.   [00:23:40] And if anything survives, it winds up here.    [00:23:43] >> All right.  So, Aaron, what would you be -- do you investigate the meteorites?  Are you looking at organic compounds in them?    [00:23:54] >> Yeah.    [00:23:54] >> So what inside of them would sort of hint at life, that life would exist within that and you can find traces of it?    [00:24:03] >> So I actually usually look at it from the other perspective.  So to me, you know, I look at meteorites, which are the surviving remnants of likely asteroids but potentially even comets.  You know, it's the material that falls to Earth.  So I look at that material and I start with the hypothesis that there was no biology.  So this to me is a dead rock from something that, you know, was an uninhabitable environment.  And then I'm looking at it for the chemistry that can go on without life present.  And so for me, this is, like, the next-best alternative to my time machine from earlier because now I have this asteroid that's been, you know, floating around.  It was formed about at the same time that the Earth was forming in the solar system, so 4.5 billion years ago.  And it's just been floating around in space.  And every now and then pieces of these asteroids get fragmented off and they make their way into Earth.   [00:25:05] And then we get these samples.  And then when I look at one of these samples in this 4.5 billion-year-old rock and I find things like amino acids that are the building blocks of proteins, you know, then I say, \"Okay, so what was the chemistry that was going on in this asteroid or in the solar system 4.5 billion years ago that led me to find the amino acid glycine?\"  That's kind of the perspective.  And we know from sort of modern biology there's DNA, RNA, and proteins.  And in proteins in particular there's 20 amino acids that are used in all of biology.  And if you look at a particularly amino acid-rich meteorite like the Murchison meteorite, which is probably one of the most famous carbon-rich meteorites, so it's got about 80 different amino acids in them.    [00:25:58] >> Whoa.    [00:25:58] >> And many of them are not used in biology at all.  And so, you know, that's both a good indicator that's it's not contamination from modern biology on it, but it's also indicative of sort of abiotic chemistry, you know, happening 4.5 billion years ago where there's a lot more random chemical reactions that are taking place.  Whereas in biology everything is very controlled.  You know, you take a range of chemicals in that you eat, and then you turn them into a fixed number of chemicals that, you know, make up your body.    [00:26:34] >> Yeah.    [00:26:35] >> Whereas abiotic chemistry will make all sorts of things, a whole range of things.    [00:26:40] >> Wow.  So what does that mean?  That means that, you know, life here has restrictions based on what could be possible.  And then maybe there's amino acids that could create life maybe on another planet with a different set of amino acids that are not restricted by the norms of Earth; is that kind of fair?    [00:27:04] >> Yeah.    [00:27:05] >> All right.  I could be a scientist [Laughs].  Maybe not, too fast.  Okay.    [00:27:10] >> Yeah.  So there's two sort of variations on that.  And both of them would sort of be the ideal case -- or you can't have two ideal cases, can you?  But both would be two very good cases.  So one is that you're looking for life on another body, and you find life, and it uses entirely different amino acids.  But it's got proteins, and they're just different than what we have on Earth.  You can say, \"Okay, cool.  You know, that's life and it's not something that we just brought in our spacecraft.\"    [00:27:41] >> Yeah.    [00:27:41] >> The other difference that could happen is subtler.  And it's -- and it's an interesting thing.  So we talked about carbon being able to make four bonds.  And carbon makes sort of a tetrahedron shape when it's in these -- when it's made four bonds.  And so it's almost like a pyramid.    [00:28:01] >> Oh, okay.    [00:28:02] >> And so what's interesting is that the four atoms connected to that carbon atom, if they're arranged in a different way stereochemically or so, like, the different sides of the pyramid and then one point sort of floating up above it, you can actually have two different sort of chiralities or stereochemistries of those molecules.  So we talk about it shorthand left-handed and right-handed molecules, which are really just an easier way for us to keep track of it.  Your two hands are the same, they do the same job.  You know, one's just a left hand and the other's a right hand.  And you don't notice a problem until you grab the wrong glove and it no longer fits on your hand.    [00:28:44] >> Okay.  So it's more of a fitting problem rather than a dominant hand kind of a problem?    [00:28:48] >> Yeah.    [00:28:48] >> It's more of a -- okay -- how things put together.    [00:28:50] >> Yeah.  And then, you know, when you measure the chemical and physical properties of molecules that are handed, they're identical except in how they interact with other handed molecules or certain kinds of light.  And so if you found life on another planet that didn't use different amino acids, it would be interesting if it used a different handedness than life on Earth.  So all life on Earth makes left-handed proteins.  And all life on Earth --    [00:29:18] >> All?    [00:29:19] >> All.    [00:29:19] >> What -- wow.  Okay.    [00:29:21] >> So all life on Earth uses left-handed amino acids in its proteins and all life on Earth uses right-handed sugars in its DNA and RNA.  And so if you were looking for life elsewhere and you found only right-handed proteins and, say, only left-handed sugars, then, hey, you've got life and it's definitely not Earth life.  So it's definitely a difference.    [00:29:43] >> Yeah.  So -- so DNA, RNA is a right-handed sugar that just happens to pair nicely with the left-handed amino acids, which are exclusive to Earth, right?    [00:29:54] >> Yeah, to biology.    [00:29:55] >> To biology?  Okay.  So then would -- is there a left-handed sugar of DNA, RNA, or are you thinking there's something entirely different, like, that would fit with the right-handed amino acid?  Maybe I'm not asking the question right.    [00:30:10] >> No, it's --    [00:30:11] >> It would still be DNA, RNA?    [00:30:14] >> Yeah.  So they're -- you know, so DNA is deoxyribose nucleic acid and RNA is ribonucleic acid.    [00:30:20] >> Right, right.    [00:30:21] >> And what we leave out of there is a little prefix at the front that has a D. And in the case of amino acids and proteins, we leave out a little symbol in front that's an L. And so it's believed that one of those came first and was fixed.  So you either had left-handed proteins or right-handed sugars that came about.  And then proteins or -- the other one evolved around it.  So you started with a system that had left-handed proteins and that fit really well with right-handed sugars.  And that was where evolution took off and that was how you got, you know, sort of left-handed life and right-hand sugars.    [00:31:00] >> I see.  Okay.    [00:31:01] >> But we were talking about synthetic biology and origins of life experiments.  So I have left-handed proteins and right-handed sugars in me.  And if you give me a drug that's made out of left-handed sugars, my left-handed proteins don't recognize those sugars anymore.  And so those molecules can stick around a lot of longer in my body because my natural mechanisms for processing, you know, DNA from food I eat or, you know, bacteria that are floating around everywhere, they don't work on those molecules.    [00:31:31] >> Hmm.  So what's an example of a left-handed sugar that would just sort of stick around?    [00:31:38] >> So you could actually make just left-handed DNA.    [00:31:41] >> Oh.    [00:31:41] >> And left-handed RNA.    [00:31:43] >> How do you make it [Laughs]?    [00:31:45] >> So that's a synthetic organic chemistry that ends up being fairly difficult.  But what's interesting about this is so people have gone in the lab and taken a naturally-occurring left-handed protein and they've synthesized a right-handed version of it.    [00:32:01] >> Yeah.    [00:32:02] >> And they've found that it works just fine.  You know, it fold into its active state.  There's no difference in the activity, except that now this right-handed protein recognizes a left-handed sugar molecule.  So in this case I think it was the glucose molecule.    [00:32:16] >> Okay.    [00:32:16] >> So we eat right-handed glucose all the time -- that's what our natural food is -- but this artificial enzyme that they made wouldn't recognize that.  But when they gave it left-handed glucose, it processed its chemical reaction just fine.    [00:32:32] >> Hmm.  So then -- all right, let's think about a hypothetical.  So if you're on another planet that isn't the mirror world, I guess, right, you got right-handed proteins and you got left-handed sugars, would it kind of look -- it's like a mirror version of Earth, right?  It's just, like, the same.  Would that work, or are we talking about something that would be entirely -- like, things would just look different, act different, or is it just a mirror image?    [00:33:01] >> It would be weight loss world.    [00:33:03] >> Weight loss world.    [00:33:04] >> You go there and eat all you want.  You don't actually -- you're not actually able to metabolize any of the food [Laughs].  Correct me if I'm wrong but, you know, there's no reason why that sort of biology wouldn't work within its own system.  But, you know, if we went there and tried to live there and eat the foot off the tree or whatever, we wouldn't get anything out of it.  If I'm not mistaken, there is a commercially available artificial sweetener that is the other-handed version of sugar and it tastes sweet, but you can't digest it.    [00:33:34] >> Huh.  So what does it do?  Does it make you -- it's not weight loss city in that world, is it?  Or is it because you're not processing it, maybe you don't gain any weight.  I don't know how that would work.    [00:33:46] >> You can't use it.    [00:33:46] >> You can't use it?    [00:33:47] >> Yeah.  It's just -- yeah.    [00:33:48] >> So would you pass it, then?  It will be -- okay.  So it wouldn't just, like, stick around and be fat.  Okay, that's good to know [Laughs].  All right.  Maybe I'll sprinkle that on some cupcakes or something and tell myself it's okay.    [00:34:05] >> Yeah.    [00:34:05] >> [Laughs] So that's interesting, just the idea of right-handedness and left-handedness.  And there's a certain set of amino acids that exist on Earth, but there's a whole realm of possibilities that can exist just because we've studied, you know, rocks in space or something.  So correct me if I'm wrong here because this is just piece of trivia that I thought I knew, but now that you guys are here, I want to ask you.  It's an asteroid when it's in space, it's a meteor when it's passing through the atmosphere, and a meteorite once it hits the ground?    [00:34:38] >> Or a meteoroid in space, which is --    [00:34:40] >> Meteoroid.    [00:34:41] >> Smaller asteroid.    [00:34:42] >> Oh, okay.    [00:34:43] >> But yes, meteor when it's passing through the atmosphere, that's the luminous ball.  And then if anything survives to the ground, that's a meteorite.    [00:34:50] >> Okay.  Yeah, that's always something that stuck in my mind just because, you know, I used to call it the wrong thing.  So when you study meteorites, you are specifically talking about the things that are on the ground?    [00:35:01] >> That's right.    [00:35:01] >> You're not going out and grabbing things and bringing them back or you're not catching things as they're passing through the atmosphere?  You're going out.  And Antarctica's a good place to find them because black rocks on a white surface are pretty good, right?    [00:35:12] >> Yep.    [00:35:12] >> Is it fair to say meteors are falling throughout atmosphere all the time?    [00:35:16] >> All the time.    [00:35:16] >> Yeah.    [00:35:17] >> On average there is a meteorite fall somewhere on Earth about once a day.    [00:35:21] >> Wow.    [00:35:22] >> But, you know, most of those are very small.  You figure 70% of them are going to land in the ocean because planet's about 70% ocean.  You know, of the remainder -- of the remaining 30% half of them are going to happen during the day and probably no one will notice them.  Most of the ones that make it down of the remainder from that -- excuse me -- fall someplace that's, you know, difficult to recover.  And it doesn't take much.  You know, tall grass is enough and you won't find them.  Swamp is enough, you won't them.  If it lands on the nuclear power plant, you're not going to get those back, either.    [00:35:56] [ Laughter ]    [00:35:58] >> On -- so on average you get about a meteorite fall a day somewhere on Earth.  There's the Meteoritical Society maintains a database of all the world's meteorites.  And they record give or take about a dozen new meteorite falls per year.  Those are the ones that are actually found.  Some of those hit something and, you know, they become hard to miss, like, coming through the roof of someone's house or dentist office.  Or other ones are just very large events that people go hunting for and find.  So there's your statistics.    [00:36:32] >> Yeah.  And a lot of the material that comes in is just dust.  By the time it makes it through.  And so if you think about, like, meteor showers that we have all the time, that's when Earth is passing throughout debris from the tail of a comet.  So this shooting star is material that's burning up, you know?  But some of that material falls in as dust.  And so you would never, you know, notice it.    [00:36:52] >> Yeah.    [00:36:53] >> But there's little grains of cosmic dust that are --    [00:36:55] >> Yeah.  We actually have a collection of that, too.  The cosmic dust collection.    [00:37:00] >> How do you collect cosmic dust?    [00:37:01] >> Airplanes -- very, very high altitude.  NASA has a -- operates a fleet of basically former spy planes -- WB-57's here at Ellington and ER-2, which is sort of like a U2, out at Dryden, California.  And they fly to 60,000 feet and up and deploy collectors that collect this falling dust out of the atmosphere.    [00:37:24] >> Wow.  So if it's not big enough to actually strike the Earth, you say it kind of disintegrates and doesn't hit the Earth, but it's there.  It's in the atmosphere just kind of floating around at 60,000 feet.  That's cool.  All right.  I like to see that collection.  That would be a pretty cool collection.  Cosmic dust.    [00:37:38] >> We can do that.    [00:37:40] >> [Laughs] So once it passes through the atmosphere, is there -- is there a change that happens?  Like, is there a difference with if you were to pick up a meteorite off the grouped, maybe there's something that -- the way it interacted with the Earth's atmosphere or something that changed something that would be different from if you were to find the same thing up in space.    [00:37:58] >> Yes.    [00:37:59] >> Okay.    [00:37:59] >> The most fundamental change is that a good probably 99% of it is now gone; it turned into a plasma on the way to the ground.  So most of it's lost.  The next big thing that happens is the outside of any meteorite you find is going to be covered with a molten crust.  I think it's called a fusion crust.  And it kind of looks like a pottery glaze.  It's from basically flash melting the surface of the thing as it's coming through the atmosphere.  And but the -- probably the biggest change that happens to any of them, you know, rule number one of meteorites is that they all have life.  And they get the life from Earth.  When they land here, they're coming into our biosphere.  They will land on the ground somewhere.  Even ones in Antarctica, we've found life in some -- terrestrial, excuse me -- life in a lot of these meteorites.  So that's the biggest change.  Because anything infecting these rocks tends to start to eat any of the carbon that's in there and process it and change the -- like he was saying, it takes the native amino acids and starts to process them into -- as you're basically turning it into microbial matter, now it has a chiral preference as the microbes grow.   [00:39:14] They change it isotopically and chemically over time, and that's probably the single-biggest change that happens.  Especially for organic chemistry and the things we're looking for, for the question of origin of life and whatnot.    [00:39:29] >> Yeah.  So then how do you isolate to find out what things have not been affected and what things you can tell are within the meteorite that, you know, were there before it came to Earth and was affected by Earth's atmosphere?    [00:39:45] >> Exactly the kind of chemical signals that Aaron was just talking about -- chirality, you know, the amino acid abundance, you know, looking for biomarkers/biosignatures, depending on what you want to call them, such as DNA.  If you find terrestrial DNA and terrestrial microbes in this thing, then it's been altered.  You can kind of expect that.  But good laboratory practice is, you know -- is fundamental to sorting out exactly that question.  You know, you have your blanks, and standards, and replicate measurements, and statistical analyses.    [00:40:20] >> And yeah, what I'm looking for molecules that are relevant to biology, I start with the assumption that anything that looks like biology in the sample is from biology that was introduced on Earth.  And then I need the evidence in the meteorite to, you know, support that -- a conclusion other than that.  So if the amino acids were made out in space, they should actually have an equal mixture of left-handed and right-handed amino acids.  They shouldn't have that predominant left-handed excess that biology shows.  So if I take a bacteria and I run it through my meteorite processing methods, I'll get all L amino acids.  And a little bit of it gets converted back to D during the process.  So a meteorite, the initial sort of baseline hypothesis is that if it's from the meteorite, it should be a 50/50 mixture.  And if it's skewed towards left-handed, then I have to assume it's biological contamination unless there's some other piece of evidence that tells me that, you know, no, this really did actually happen out in space.    [00:41:26] >> For example, way more right-handed amino acids, right?    [00:41:30] >> So that would be, you know, the ideal scenario, especially when looking for life.    [00:41:35] >> Yeah.    [00:41:36] >> There are other less sort of obvious markers that we can look at.  So one of them has to do with stable isotope ratios.  And so if we think about something like carbon, it normally has in the most abundant form of carbon has six protons and six neurons.  And it's carbon-12.    [00:41:54] >> Okay.    [00:41:54] >> And then about 1% of carbon on Earth is carbon-13.  And then some trace amount is carbon-14, which is actually radioactive.  And so that's what they use for radioactive dating.    [00:42:05] >> Okay.    [00:42:05] >> And so things that are found on Earth tend to be enriched in carbon-12 relative to carbon-13.  And then even furthermore, things that are processed by biology on Earth really like carbon-12 and they don't like carbon-13 very much.  Now, what's interesting is if you go out into a very cold environment, so out in sort of our pre-sun, our protosolar nebula where places were much colder, you actually prefer the heavy isotopes.  So carbon-13 is actually favored over carbon-12 more so relative to the preference on Earth.  So it's not like you have 10 times as much carbon-13, it's like 1.01% carbon-13 instead of, you know, 1% carbon-13.  And so from these very small signal differences, you can actually tell that something was actually made out in space rather than processed by biology on Earth.  And it's these kind of subtle differences that they actually use in, like, Olympics events to determine whether people were using steroids.    [00:43:11] >> Oh, really?    [00:43:12] >> Because our biochemistry produces different, like, testosterone than, like, soy plants if you're getting it from plants.  And so you can actually tell from the isotopic signatures whether the testosterone in an athlete came from them or if it was produced in a lab or grown in, you know, some plant somewhere.    [00:43:32] >> Wow.  The answer's in the details.    [00:43:34] >> Yes.    [00:43:34] >> Literally you're looking at the finest details and even the slightest change, you can tell if it's otherworldly.  That's pretty cool.    [00:43:42] >> Yeah.  And that's where you have to start with the hypothesis that this is contamination.    [00:43:47] >> Yeah.    [00:43:48] >> You know?  Unless you can prove that it's not.    [00:43:51] >> Okay.  So then -- so then is there an effort to go out and, you know, find something more pristine?  Maybe rather than doing -- getting a meteorite maybe go out and get an asteroid that has not touched the Earth's atmosphere, is there something we're doing now?    [00:44:09] >> Yep.  That would be OSIRIS-REx.    [00:44:11] >> Okay.    [00:44:12] >> So OSIRIS-REx mission is on its way to Bennu.  It will collect samples from that asteroid.  It is a carbonaceous body.  We can tell this by, you know, spectroscopy at a distance.  And actually, what we're touching on here is a sample return missions and why you would want them.  This is actually really nice conversation leading up to it.  For example, let me explain why you want to do missions like this in general.  Let me use the example of Mars.  Okay?  We're seriously talking about doing this, collecting samples from Mars and returning them from Earth now.  I had said earlier that we already have a quarter of metric ton of Martian meteorites on Earth.  So if you're just going to go get more for the sake of getting more, it's really not a really use of your resources.  But we also talked about how any meteorite that falls to Earth, you have to assume it's contaminated.  And so what you -- the really nice things you get out of a sample return mission that you can't get from meteorites is you get to collect materials where you to great detail know their contamination and alteration history.   [00:45:25] And by and large you're going to get stuff that's very minimally altered.  That's usually one of design goals of the mission -- definitely part of the ones we've ever done.  So you control the contamination history of the meteorite, and you get to know to great detail what it is by monitoring during the course of the mission.  You also get to select your samples.  For the example of Mars samples, what we can do is collect types of rock that we don't have in the Martian meteorite collection.  Sedimentary rocks take very poorly to getting pounded by a meteorite and blasted off the planet.  They tend to turn into dust and you never see them.  But we can go and carefully collect these.  Basically, the meteorites that survive the trip from Mars to Earth tend to be very, very tough rocks.  Now we can go and carefully collect the ones that we are actually more interested in, in some respects for investigating the hypothesis of past or present life on that planet -- the sedimentary rocks, the evaporites, the very friable, crumbly stuff that may preserve evidence of ancient organics.   [00:46:34] Those we can collect.  So -- and finally, you get to know exactly where your rock came from.  When you look at a meteorite, you know, most meteorites, Martian meteorites, we can say, \"Where this from?  Well, it's from Mars, you know, somewhere on the planet.\"  If you go and do a sample return mission, you know the contamination history, you get to select samples that you don't otherwise have access to, and you know exactly where it came from on the planet.  And you can take everything you learned about it in the lab and apply it to, you know, an outcrop, a spot, a crater, a lithology, some location on that planet and start to build the greater history of the planet in great detail that way.  So that -- whether it's for Mars or for Bennu or, you know, eventually comets or otherwise, that's kind of the driving impetus for doing these sample return missions.    [00:47:26] >> Hey well, I'm going to stay optimistic and say if we explore some of these spots in the more pristine environment of Mars, I think we can maybe look for the origins of life that way.    [00:47:37] >> But if there's -- you know, so as Marc was saying, you know, the rocks that we get on Earth from meteorites are really hard, tough ones.  And so, you know, the chances of life living in a solidified lava flow is probably a little bit different than if you could actually get material that was in a location that we think was the bottom of a lake, say, where would expect life to have existed and perhaps get actually trapped into that sedimentary material.    [00:48:05] >> Yeah, that's true.  Because location, location, location, right?  [Laughs]    [00:48:09] >> It's a fair argument.  Like I said, you know, there's a lot of discussion about this.  It is a -- not all scientists are -- how do I put it?  We're still discussing it.    [00:48:23] [ Laughter ]    [00:48:25] >> More research is needed.    [00:48:26] >> More research.    [00:48:28] >> And scientists hate consensus.    [00:48:30] >> Ah.    [00:48:30] >> Yeah, pretty much.    [00:48:33] >> So then what's -- you said Bennu is carbaceous [phonetic]?  Is that the word?    [00:48:38] >> Carbonaceous.    [00:48:39] >> Okay.  Carbonaceous.    [00:48:40] >> It is black as coal.    [00:48:41] >> Black as coal.  So it's full of carbon.  Very interesting thing to observe.  So what's OSIRIS-REx going to do?  Is it going to land and bring something back or is it just going to stay there?  What's the mission like?    [00:48:53] >> Yeah.  So Bennu is about a half-kilometer-wide asteroid.  OSIRIS-REx launched in September of 2016.    [00:49:01] >> Okay.    [00:49:01] >> Rendezvous is going to be in 2018.    [00:49:05] >> All right.    [00:49:06] >> And actually, the spacecraft is going to orbit for about a year and a half and carefully map out surface of the asteroid to identify scientifically interesting regions that it can collect a sample from.  And the scientifically interesting question will be counterbalanced by safety.    [00:49:23] >> Ah.    [00:49:23] >> Because you can't, you know, really endanger the spacecraft while you're trying to collect the sample.    [00:49:27] >> Yeah.  Oh, that sharp mountain looks really, really interesting.    [00:49:31] >> Yeah.  Yeah, it's more important that you get the sample back than [Laughs] that you choose the exact-most scientifically interesting place.  And so the -- after finding a suitable location, the spacecraft is going to go down and it's got almost like a little reverse vacuum cleaner.  So it's got a little touch and go sample acquisition mechanism that will actually contact the surface of the asteroid.  And then it's got nitrogen gas that will it will actually blow into that surface.  And that will actually push the dust into the sample collector.  And so like I was saying, like a reverse vacuum cleaner.  You're blowing the dirt in.    [00:50:12] >> Blowing it, yeah.    [00:50:13] >> You know, that works on a rather small body because gravity is much less of an issue there.  So the mission requirement is to get at least 60 grams.  And from experiments on Earth and under similar gravity conditions, they should be able to get several hundred grams or more that will then be tucked away into a sample return capsule that will make its way back to Earth.  It will land.  I'm amazed that people can do this with orbital dynamics.  But it will land in Utah.    [00:50:45] >> Wow.    [00:50:46] >> In the desert in September of 2023.  And these samples will be transported to a curation facility and processed and then eventually made available to researchers all over the world who are interested in, you know, studying this material.    [00:51:01] >> Oh, that is cool.  Fire it out to space and land it in Utah.  That's -- that's a target.  That's quite a target practice right there.  That's pretty cool.  So I guess it's going to kind of be like -- so the moon rocks that we have here in our -- some of them have actually never been exposed to Earth's atmosphere, right?  They've been sealed.  Like, are we going to expect the same thing for OSIRIS-REx?  It's going to be sealed away from Earth's atmosphere?    [00:51:27] >> Some of the samples will be preserved for future research.    [00:51:31] >> Okay.    [00:51:31] >> I think the design of the capsule doesn't keep it entirely free of Earth's atmosphere.  But for what they're trying to do for the mission goals, that was appropriate.  But yeah, definitely some will be preserved away for future generations just like any other collections.    [00:51:49] >> All right.  That's a pretty cool mission.    [00:51:51] >> Yeah, yeah.  Looking forward to seeing it.    [00:51:54] >> Yeah.  2023, that will be a cool thing to watch it come back.  So, Aaron, since I have you here, I did kind of want to bring up DNA sequencing just because you -- you know, that's such an interesting thing that will happen on the International Space Station, literally sequencing DNA in real-time.  Can you kind of explain kind of what that project is all about?    [00:52:15] >> Yeah.  So this -- this is a project that actually has sort of two goals.  So one is, you know, crew health and human exploration.  And then I have my sort of ulterior motive or goal, which is looking for life elsewhere in the solar system.  So it's a nice marriage of two applications of the same technology.    [00:52:38] >> Pretty cool marriage.    [00:52:39] >> Yeah.    [00:52:40] >> Looking for life outside the solar system and studying astronauts in space.  Pretty cool pairing.    [00:52:44] >> Yeah.    [00:52:45] >> Yeah.    [00:52:45] >> And so this -- the DNA sequencing, we want to use it for crew health, to be able to do environmental monitoring.  And so you want to look on the International Space Station or ISS for microbes, be able to identify them to know if there's harmful organisms there.  And as we think about going beyond ISS, if you're going to send humans to Mars and they're going to go on a three-year mission, if the crew member shows signs of an infection, you know, we want to have a diagnostic capability to know, you know, so if you cough up some phlegm, okay, what's in that phlegm?  And then is that something that needs to be treated with an antibiotic or that something your body will clear on its own?  You know, be able to make informed decisions about that.  Because we're not going to be able to do resupply missions on -- it would hard to hit a moving target flying to Mars and catch up to it.    [00:53:40] >> Yeah.    [00:53:41] >> So we're trying to give that sort of in-flight, you know, diagnostic capability with the DNA sequencing.  And then when the humans get to Mars, you know, I'd like them to be able to go out and dig up a sample and extract it and actually look for life that's present on Mars.    [00:53:58] >> Wow.  So sequencing DNA is kind of like -- I'm trying to explain it in as laymen terms as possible to wrap my brain around it because it is pretty complicated stuff.  But it's basically identifying, right?    [00:54:08] >> Yeah.    [00:54:08] >> It's -- so if you said, you know, if they have a cough, they can do a sample and they know exactly what you're coughing up.  They know the exact makeup, and then you can identify what kind of antibiotic you need to take because you know exactly what's inside your body.    [00:54:21] >> Yeah, yeah.  So DNA, you know, is like a language.  It's got an alphabet.  There's only four letters -- there's A, G, C, and T. But all life on Earth uses that same alphabet from the tiniest microbe to humans.  And so it's sort of like books in a library, right?  The books are all different because they have more letters or less letters that are arranged in different words.  And so, you know, analyzing -- I guess sequencing DNA is like taking a page out of that book and then searching for all the words on that page.  And then if you had a computer that could process it, you could say, \"Oh, that page came from A Tale of Two Cities.  Or that page came from this book.\"    [00:55:07] >> All right.    [00:55:08] >> Or that paragraph.  And so the more of that page or paragraph, the better of a match you can get, you know?  If you have a chapter of a book, then you can nail it down to -- discounting plagiarism.  You know?  [Laughs] You can nail it down to a single book or a single organism.    [00:55:25] >> All right.  That's pretty cool.  Although, I mean, for an alphabet of four letters, you know, life is pretty diverse [Laughs] for such a tiny alphabet.  And, you know, you're taking analogies from books and I'm imagining the books.  But four letters that can make all these different things, that's pretty astounding.    [00:55:45] >> Yeah.  Well, so a virus can have around 50,000 of these letters in its entire genome.  So all the instructions that a virus needs to do to infect a cell and then get the cell to make more copies of it all encapsulated in 50,000 letters.    [00:56:01] >> Whoa.    [00:56:01] >> And that's something like the microbe that that virus might affect could have several million of these letters.  And then humans are about 2.5 billion of these letters or 3 billion.  And then actually, there are certain plants that even have, like, ten-fold more of these letters in their genome.  But it's a -- you know, it's pretty amazing that biology can do so much with a limited -- sort of the limited alphabet.    [00:56:31] >> That's true.  But thank goodness there's no -- there's no word in the English language that's 10 million letters long.    [00:56:38] >> Yeah.    [00:56:38] >> So that's pretty good.  It would be really hard to write A Tale of Two Cities with [Laughs] -- you would probably get one word in and still it would be the biggest novel you've ever seen in your life [Laughs].    [00:56:51] >> Yeah.  An interesting thing about that is they are actually starting to switch to -- or trying to develop DNA as a way to store information.  So it's like a new data, I guess, like replacing solid state drives or spinning hard drives is to encapsulate things in DNA.    [00:57:09] >> Whoa.  All right.  Well, it's got a lot of storage, right?  Because you can --    [00:57:12] >> Yeah, yeah.    [00:57:13] >> -- you can fit it.  Wow.  Okay.  That's difficult to wrap my mind around [Laughs].  I'm thinking about storing something in, like, a cell.    [00:57:22] >> Can I talk about something else weird, too?    [00:57:24] >> Yes, please.    [00:57:25] >> No [Laughs].    [00:57:26] >> This is not the place for that [Laughs].    [00:57:28] >> So one of the things interesting that we've -- you know, we've talked about life as we know it and the search for life.  And then there's this concept of being able to identify life as you don't know it.    [00:57:41] >> Whoa.    [00:57:42] >> And so we've talked about, you know, left-handed and right-handed proteins and it would be great if you could find right-handed proteins or amino acids that aren't on Earth, or left-handed sugars, or sugars that aren't on Earth.  So that's one of the cool things for me about the DNA Sequencer Project is the way that it sequences DNA has actually got these little tiny pores that are actually just big enough for a single strand of DNA to pass through.  And when there's nothing in the pore, you get basically an open current.  And then as the DNA molecule passes through it, it blocks that pore.  And so the current is reduced.  And the reduction in current tells you something about the sequence of DNA that's passing through it.  So, like, AGCTA would have a different signal blocking than GACTA, for example.  And so it's an entirely electrochemical way of detecting this.  And you can apply it to other molecules that we might not necessarily recognize as life.   [00:58:46] So --    [00:58:46] >> L, M, N, O, P.    [00:58:48] >> Yes [Laughs].  That's exactly right.  And so people are using this technology to sequence RNA, which is different than DNA.  It differs in the sugar, so it's deoxyribose versus ribose.  But in RNA an interesting thing is that you have more than the A, G, C, and T -- actually, RNA uses U instead of T. But in things like ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA, which are present in biology, extensive modification is made of the bases.  So there's actually, like, 118 different letters that show up in RNA that people are figuring out how to actually characterize using this nanopore sequencing.    [00:59:28] >> Wow.    [00:59:29] >> And so I'm interested -- and not just me, a number of people are looking at this -- but, you know, making a more universal life detection mechanism.  So, you know, if you can do DNA by now you don't need the deoxyribose, it can be any sugar in there.    [00:59:46] >> Oh.    [00:59:46] >> Or instead of the A, G, C, and T letters, if you can L, M, N, O, P as Marc said.    [00:59:51] >> Yeah.  It will just look for letters and then just see what pops up.    [00:59:54] >> Yeah.    [00:59:54] >> Yeah.    [00:59:55] >> Yeah.  And so you lose some of the resolution.  So maybe you won't know that it was an A. But if you start seeing a polymer of semirepeating, you know, signals or letters, you know, at some point that starts to tell you there's information there.    [01:00:12] >> Oh, wow.    [01:00:13] >> Yeah.  That's where it gets really deep [Laughs], is that, you know, probably one of the most important biosignatures or biomarkers is information.  Right?  You have to have instructions for how to do whatever it is that the organism is doing and a way to copy that information.    [01:00:29] >> Wow.  All right.  I can think of, like, 100 different ways we can go and just go on a tangent and talk about all these crazy topics.  It's amazing.  But we do have to wrap up.  So I kind of wanted to end on something like a -- some of the guests I like to bring and ask this question specifically because we're at the Johnson Space Center and it's human space flight.  But for you guys, you know, in the search for life, why from your point of view is human exploration so important to discovery, especially in the field of looking for the origins of life?    [01:01:01] >> I can give my answer, sure.    [01:01:02] >> Yeah.    [01:01:03] >> You know, basically humans have an innate need to explore.  It's something written into, I think, most children.  Unfortunately, I think a lot of adults tend to lose that over time.  But it's there.  The -- we can explore with robots.  You know, I'll use some air quotes, you can't see them.  It's exploration, but in a sense you're -- with a robot, you are exploring through a computer screen.  And that's fine, you do learn.  It is exploration.  But on -- it may not be -- you know, at what point is that no longer satisfactory?  I'd answer that with a question: At what point do you just have to go there and see it yourself?  You know, there's technical arguments for why you want send people.  They are, I believe, much better in a field environment when you're investigating something.  You know, they can turn around data, they can come up with new ideas, they can process things.   [01:02:07] You know, you can get a whole lot more out of having somebody kneel down, pick up a rock, and turn it over in their hand in some instances than some of the data you get from rovers and landers and such.  You know, that's been my experience.  But fundamentally there's that innate drive to explore.  And yeah, that's the question.  You know, when is watching all this through a computer screen going to be unsatisfactory?    [01:02:39] >> How about, you Aaron?    [01:02:41] >> I got to follow that up?    [01:02:43] [ Laughter ]  So I would, you know, echo the -- the -- just the much more versatile skillset that, you know, a human has compared to a robot, you know, where a human can look out for several miles and walk and adjust its path in a pretty easy way and, you know, not get stuck somewhere.  So you can, you know, explore a lot more ground in a given, you know, time period.  If you want to dig a hole, you can dig a deeper hole because you've got a shovel and you just keep digging until you decide that -- you know, it's easier for a human to make these decisions themselves than, you know, try to communicate all that to a -- to a robot.  But I think, yeah, as Marc was saying, it comes back to that sort of innate curiosity, you know, where -- what's over the mountain, what's across the river, what's at the bottom of the ocean.  You know, we didn't know that these other places would be good or great or, you know, useful.   [01:03:44] But you kind have to know.  And so, you know, going to Mars or the moon and learning how to live on the moon or learning how to live on Mars teaches you something about how to live on Earth, how to travel in space, how to live on other planets.  And then it serves as a stepping stone.  Okay, well, what's beyond Mars?  What's beyond our solar system?  You know?  We're going to need to develop light speed travel and all that.  But, you know, assuming that we're able to do those things, you know, it just -- it enables the next frontier, if you will.    [01:04:21] >> Very cool.  Guys, thanks so much for coming on today.  This was a fascinating topic.  And always at the end of these I get so charged, especially when we end with, like, the why.  I'm like, \"Yes, let's do it.  Let's go out and explore.\"  So thanks so much for coming on and talking about life.  Can't wait to follow it up with one of these weird tangents that we almost went on today.  But thanks again, guys.    [01:04:40] >> No, our pleasure.    [01:04:42] [ Music ]    [01:04:50] >> Houston, go ahead.    [01:04:50] >> [Inaudible] of the space shuttle.    [01:04:52] >> Roger, zero G and I feel fine.    [01:04:54] [ Inaudible ]    [01:04:55] >> We came in peace for all mankind.    [01:04:57] >> It's actually a huge honor to bring [inaudible].    [01:05:00] >> Not because they are easy but because they are hard.    [01:05:02] >> [Inaudible] Houston, welcome to space.    [01:05:05] [ Music ]    [01:05:06] >> Hey.  Thanks for sticking around.  So today we talked about Dr. Aaron Burton and Dr. Marc Fries about life in the solar system, went off on a couple awesome tangents and had some great conversations just about everything life in the universe and just kind of scratched the surface, really.  We can do a bunch more episodes just on this topic alone.  But if you cannot wait and need to know this stuff right now, both Aaron and Marc are part of the astromaterials group known as ARES here.  You can go to ARES.jsc.nasa.gov to learn all about the different initiatives.  Just going on, on astromaterials alone and that's -- you can learn more about OSIRIS-REx there, and you can learn more about meteorites and curation.  And even you can learn how to get your hands on a meteorite, if you are dying to get your hands on and study the sample material yourself and maybe search for organic compounds.  Otherwise if you just want to focus on just OSIRIS-REx, go to NASA.gov/OSIRIS-REx.  On social media if you want to talk to us there, there is the Johnson Space Center accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.   [01:06:09] Also astromaterials has their own, NASA ARES on several different accounts.  Otherwise you can find them, it's NASA Astromaterials.  If you want to use the hashtag #AskNASA on any one of those platforms, any one of those pages, you can submit an idea.  Just make sure to mention it's for Houston, We Have a Podcast so we can find it and answer it in a later episode for you or perhaps dedicate an entire episode to it.  So this podcast was recorded on November 28th, 2017.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, Tracy Calhoun, and Jenny Knots.  Thanks to again Dr. Aaron Burton and Dr. Marc Fries for coming on the show.  We'll be back next week.",

        description: "[00:00:00] Gary Jordan (Host): Houston We Have a Podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 29, The National Lab in Space.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  So this is the podcast where we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, sometimes some of our partners.  We bring them right here on the show to tell you all the cool stuff about what's going on here at NASA.  So today we're talking about the section of the International Space Station that's designated as a U.S. national laboratory.  We're talking with Patrick O'Neill, the marketing and communications manager at the Center for Advancement of Science in Space, or CASIS.  We had a great discussion about what it means to be a U.S. national lab, how CASIS is bringing research from companies, research to institutions, and government agencies to the Space Station, and the things we're learning that benefit human kind.  So with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with Mr. Patrick O'Neill.  Enjoy.    [00:00:53] [ Music ]   Host: All right, well, Patrick, thanks so much for taking the time to come on the podcast, especially because you are remote, right?  You're not even here in Houston.  You're calling in from Florida, right?    [00:01:26] Patrick O’Neill: I am over at Kenney Space Center as we speak.    [00:01:29] Host: Awesome.  And that's where CASIS is sort of housed?  Is that where you guys are?  Or are you kind of all over the place?    [00:01:36] Patrick O’Neill: Well, we actually have a couple of houses across the country.  But yes, in theory, this is kind of where our headquarters is based out of in the Kenney Space Center area, as well as Melbourne, Florida.  But we also have strong office presence just outside of Johnson Space Center in Houston, and then we have a few more offices that are sporadically placed throughout the country.    [00:01:54] Host: Very cool.  All right, so you're over at the Kenney Space Center, yeah, Kennedy Space Center right now.  So how's the weather over there?    [00:02:00] Patrick O’Neill: The weather right now is, it's a tad cold.  We had a little cold front come through.  So it's nowhere near as bad as it is in places like the northeast, but, you know, we actually had to turn the heat on, and that's something that is a rare occurrence here down in Florida.    [00:02:12] Host: Yeah, you know, I mean, over here, the weather has just been absolutely crazy.  I'm sure you've been paying attention.  But this past week, I mean, we had like ice and freezing rain and all the roads were covered in ice, and Houston just doesn't have the infrastructure to deal with that.  So we just, you know, the center shut down.  The south can't really deal with that stuff.  And right now, it's freezing right now.  I mean, we're in the studio, and the studio is always cold, but it's like, you know, 30s right now, which is, I'm sure the people in the north are thinking, man, that guy is definitely a baby when it comes to the cold.  But, you know, when you're used to 60s and 70s in the winter, this can definitely, this can definitely get to you.    [00:02:48] Patrick O’Neill: Well, you know, being in Florida right now, it's 55 when I hopped out of my car, and everyone is bundled up as though, you know, it's 15 outside.  So, you know, I think that we are certainly living in First World problems as well.    [00:03:00] Host: I've seen that before.  I've been to-- it was an air show out at Ellington Field one time, and it was, it was low 60s and not a cloud in the sky.  Absolutely crystal clear day.  And I was wearing shorts and a T-shirt because the Sun was beating, and I thought it was a hot day, especially on the tarmac, but you had folks that were bundled up as if it was a cold winter day, and I could not believe it.  Low 60s, and they were bundled up.  It was crazy.    [00:03:25] Patrick O’Neill: Can't take them anywhere.    [00:03:26] Host: Okay, but we're not connecting, you know, from across, from Houston to Kennedy to talk about the weather.  We're here to talk about the U.S. National Laboratory.  And you being the marketing and communications manager of CASIS have a pretty good understanding of just CASIS as a whole.  So why don't we just talk about that, you know, what is, what is CASIS?    [00:03:49] Patrick O’Neill: Yeah, sure, so first and foremost, CASIS stands for the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space.  Since we are kind of a brainchild of NASA, and since NASA equally likes to work in the world of acronyms, we decided to go out there and call ourselves CASIS.    [00:04:01] Host: Good call.    [00:04:02] Patrick O’Neill: And so in 2011, we were tasked with managing the U.S. National Laboratory aboard the International Space Station.    [00:04:08] Host: Okay, and so that means what?  Managing-- what is the U.S. National Laboratory?    [00:04:14] Patrick O’Neill: What is it that you say you do here, yeah.  So when I say that we manage the U.S. National Lab on the International Space Station, that means that we get to select, broker, manifest, and then promote the research that goes on the U.S. National Lab portion of the flight manifest.  And so what do I mean by flight manifest is on a given resupply mission to send research and supplies to the station, there will be up to 50% of that research allocation that is designated as U.S. National Laboratory based research.  And so we get that 50%.  So we pick and choose the research that goes up.  And within my role, I get to work alongside you and other folks at NASA to help communicate the benefits of the research that is going to the Space Station.    [00:04:57] Host: Okay, I see.  So the U.S. National Lab is a NASA thing.  And then CASIS is the, you know, is the industry that manages it, I guess.    [00:05:06] Patrick O’Neill: I would say that the U.S. National Laboratory is a U.S. thing.    [00:05:10] Host: U.S. thing, I see.    [00:05:11] Patrick O’Neill: And so a little bit of background on how the Space Station ended up becoming a National Laboratory.  In 2005, Congress, in their infinite wisdom, they were looking at all the research that was happening on the Space Station, and, you know, it was catered towards NASA's exploratory endeavors, living and working in space, better understanding the human condition, so that you can do long duration space flight or go beyond low Earth orbit.  And they said, that's terrific, and we're learning so much, but there's also so much more that we could be doing on this Space Station.  What if we were to open it up to all sectors of the research community, whether that's Fortune 500 companies, or innovative startups, academic researchers, student investigators.  I mean, there's so much that we could do on this Space Station.  So what if we turn it into a National Laboratory and really kind of see what this thing is capable of from a research perspective, and see if we can't use the microgravity environment to benefit life on Earth.  So in 2005, that's kind of how we got this, the concept of a National Laboratory.  And then in 2010, I want to say, Congress worked with NASA saying, you know, we need to have a non-NASA entity, a non-profit organization manage the research on this U.S. National Laboratory.   [00:06:25] And so in 2011, CASIS was selected by NASA to manage the National Laboratory, and we have been assuming management of the National Lab since that timeframe.    [00:06:35] Host: There you go.  Okay, so what was originally a laboratory for NASA, to do NASA research, now is opened up to-- is it anyone or is it just people in the U.S.?    [00:06:47] Patrick O’Neill: So, and that's a great question.  It is open, in theory, to anyone.  However, you have to have U.S. subsidiaries or U.S. interests involved.  So, I mean, there's a various of companies that we work with that might have headquarters overseas.  But, you know, if it's a pharmaceutical company, I'll give you an example.  Like Merck Pharmaceuticals, I believe that they're based, in theory, overseas, but they have such a large footprint here in the United States, and so we work with investigators that are based here in the U.S.    [00:07:15] Host: I see.  Okay, but then they can use, you know, they can go through CASIS.  CASIS will manage getting whatever research that they want to do up on the International Space Station because it will eventually benefit the, you know, U.S. citizens.    [00:07:30] Patrick O’Neill: Right, and what I would say, the caveat, again, is that the research that we manifest and broker and send to the Space Station and then send back down to the Space Station, in some cases, again, the caveat always has to be that there has to be a tangible benefit for life here on Earth as opposed to, again, NASA is much more focused on exploratory research endeavors.    [00:07:50] Host: How about that?  Okay, and you said 50%.  That's a decent amount of research.    [00:07:54] Patrick O’Neill: That's a pretty good chunk of change, right?    [00:07:56] Host: Yeah, yeah, especially, I mean, you've got that balance of I guess, you know, there's a lot of human research that goes on that the astronauts do to themselves, right, to understand what is happening to the human body in space.  And I'm sure there's other human research elements that are being done for people here on Earth, right?  Or maybe it kind of even translates just the NASA studies and the U.S. National Lab studies.    [00:08:24] Patrick O’Neill: Sure, so what I would say is think about a lot of the research that was happening on the Space Station, or even with the shuttle program bay in the day, that was focused on the astronauts, and kind of using them as the guinea pig, so-to-speak.  But then you now have-- so you're able to understand basic concepts of life science research, or how bodies adapt, or in a microgravity environment.  So a lot of the pre-research that was done has now set the foundation for a lot of the research that is going up from pharmaceutical companies.  So NASA really set, or paved the way for a lot of the research that's going up now.  Because now it's much more targeted, I think, based on a lot of the early findings that were had with astronauts in space for extended periods of time.    [00:09:10] Host: Okay, so yeah, it kind of benefits everyone both ways, right?    [00:09:12] Patrick O’Neill: Absolutely, yep.    [00:09:13] Host: So you've got, you know, the citizens, but then also the astronauts.  There you go.  Okay, so let's talk about just, you know, CASIS and NASA.  So you said, you know, Congress decided there needed to be a non-profit to manage all of this, so NASA didn't have to do it.  And, you know, we can build this sort of industry of research that goes up into microgravity.  And that's where CASIS comes in.  So how is the relationship there with NASA and CASIS, and then with, and you said it was research partners, industry, how does that all work?    [00:09:47] Patrick O’Neill: So what I would say first and foremost is that, you know, NASA and CASIS, you know, we truly like to use the concept that we are powered through partnership.  Everything that we do, and I talk with your team on a daily basis headquarters, and, you know, so from a PR perspective, there's an awful lot of strategy in place from a communication perspective.  There is equally the same thing from a program science perspective, you know, what are kind of the goals and objectives that we're all collectively trying to do so that we can communicate effectively to the public and to the research community that they could take advantage of this incredible research platform.  So, you know, there is an awful lot of back and forth that happens on a daily basis between our collective organizations, and it's all done, again, with the intention of communicating about the science now, as well as the opportunities that might exist for researchers down the road.    [00:10:34] Host: So is CASIS the one that actually goes out and finds people to bring research to the U.S. National Lab?    [00:10:41] Patrick O’Neill: That's one of our jobs.  And, you know, I'm sure that we'll talk a little bit more about maybe some of the other partners that are involved in helping to bring research to the Space Station and the National Lab, in particular.  But yes, that's one of the definite core functions of CASIS is to seek out traditional partners, non-traditional partners, to try to just educate people, again, on how it is that, you know, your company or your research institution could be benefited from sending their research to the Space Station.  And, you know, what I would throw in as a caveat for that, and that's something that I have a chance to go and do frequently, is helping to tell that story of sending research to station.  You know, a lot of times when you go meet with a company, the first thing that they sit there and say is wow, that's really cool, but how expensive is this going to be?  I mean, it just seems like sending something to and from the Space Station, that's just going to be, you know, time-intensive, labor-intensive, and it's going to be cost-prohibitive.  And so one of the great things that has happened with the National Laboratory is that to send your research to the Space Station, to have the astronaut as your lab technician, to send the research back down, those are costs that aren't passed over to the researcher.   [00:11:47] Those are costs that are not passed over to the particular company.  Because those are costs that you and I as taxpayers of the United States of America have already made that investment into.  So it's nowhere near as expensive to send your research to and from station, as folks would think.  And now you're able to take advantage of it from a marketing and PR perspective.  So especially if you're talking to major companies, you know, it's not only what it is that you're going to be able to learn, but how is it that you're going to be able to capitalize on this to separate yourself from your competitors, saying that we are doing more to be as innovative as we possibly can, and what's more innovative than sending research to the International Space Station?    [00:12:25] Host: Yeah, but then, okay, so you got this cost element, and it seems like there's a lot of cost that's absorbed, so that way it makes it, like say it's not cost-prohibitive.  You can actually do this, and it could be affordable, and you could get something out of it, especially from an innovative perspective.  But then I'm sure, you know, you, as the marketing PR guy, you have a pitch for what is so great about microgravity, right?  What is it that you can bring, what research can you bring to this microgravity environment, the only one that exists, and then, you know, accomplish what you need to accomplish?    [00:12:59] Patrick O’Neill: Yeah, and so, you know, you kind of touched on it.  I mean, you know, microgravity, in and of itself, I mean, the fundamental variable that we are all familiar with here on Earth is gravity.  It's always around us at all times.  I mean, there might be instances where you could potentially take it away, but not to the level that you can in a microgravity environment like the Space Station has.  And so now, you know, you're able to really look at things in an entirely different dimension than you have ever looked at research previously.  And it doesn't matter what type of research.  Life science, physical science, material science, Earth observation, remote sensing, technology development, all of these are scientific factors that here on Earth, you know, again, there's gravity.  Whereas up there, absolutely not.  You don't have that same level of gravity.  And you have an opportunity to be, to have your research exposed to this microgravity environment for, you know, 30, 60, sometimes longer than that days.  And so from that, you know, what is it that you're able to learn when you are looking at things entirely different than you're used to in your typical laboratory setting.    [00:14:02] Host: Sweet.  Okay, so there's been a lot of research already that has been sent up to the International Space Station.  And there's been experiments that have been exposed to microgravity.  So what are some of the things we're finding?  What are some of the cool things that you can get out of sending your stuff to microgravity?    [00:14:17] Patrick O’Neill: Well, you know, I think we're going to need another podcast for that one.  I mean, but again, I touched on it in my previous answer, it doesn't matter what type of scientific discipline you're focused on.  I mean, microgravity has the ability to enable findings that, you know, just again, you're not going to find anywhere else.  And one of the cool ones that came out last year, I want to say it was last year, was we brokered an investigation with Kentucky Space, and they sent planarian flatworms to the station, and they were looking to just kind of see how these worms regenerated in a microgravity environment.  And they got a pretty peculiar result when one of them came back with two heads.  And, you know, something like that, it's just, you know, you would just not think that that would be the case.  And now all of a sudden, you have these worms on station for 30 days, they come back down, and then they just decide that they want to regenerate in entirely different ways.  So that's a perfect example.  We've sent a variety of rodent research investigations to the station.  And we've done that for multiple reasons.  I mean, first and foremost, rodents represent a model organism that you can take advantage of, and their growth pattern is nowhere near as lengthy as ours.   [00:15:26] So if you're able to have rodents on station for 30 days, you know, that might be the vast majority of their adult life.  And one of the reasons that you would send rodents up is based on using the astronauts in the past, you know, muscle wasting, bone density loss are greatly accelerated in a microgravity environment.  So it almost, it almost truly accelerates that aging process, so-to-speak.  And so you're able to kind of do that similar type of research on a rodent, for instance, and if they're on station for 30 or 60 days, that might be, again, the vast majority of their adult lifespan because of the fact that they're in space and it kind of accelerates that growth, that aging process.  So what can you do from a muscle wasting or a bone density perspective when it comes to research, and how can that potentially help the aging population here on the ground, or how can it help those that have been wounded in battle?  I mean, those are the types of research investigations that have been happening on station and will continue to happen on station, because it's all about trying to improve the care or the lifespan or the quality of life for those of us here on Earth.    [00:16:28] Host: All right, yeah, learning a lot, especially, and this is one of those examples that we were talking about earlier, where this kind of goes both ways, right?  So you can learn about just what happens to bones and muscles in their microgravity environment.  And then get way more samples than you-- or examples.  So you can kind of learn from them and then kind of bring what you learn and then bring it down to Earth for research on stuff like-- and I know one of them that comes to mind is research on osteoporosis, because it's a big, you know, bone disease.    [00:16:57] Patrick O’Neill: Absolutely.    [00:16:58] Host: Yeah, now, I'm sure, when you say you take your research and you send it up to space, right, I'm sure it's not just you just kind of throw it in the lab, right?  I'm sure it's a laboratory, so there are facilities there.  So what sorts of things can researchers or facilities can researchers put their environments in?    [00:17:17] Patrick O’Neill: And I think that that's a great segue.  Because to your point, it's not just as easy as just, you know, throwing it up there and seeing what happens.  Anything that goes to the station first and foremost has to be sent up in flight certified hardware.  And so when I talked earlier about, you know, the flight up, the flight down, the astronaut as your lab technician, all of those are costs that are not passed over to the researcher.  So then that leads to the question of, well, what is the out-of-pocket cost that's going to be passed over to the researcher?  And it's sending your research up in that flight certified hardware.  And there are multiple companies, and this is one of the great things about station two, is it's not just a research angle, it's an opportunity for companies to be able to validate their research facilities, their ability to send research safely to and from Earth to a microgravity environment.  So it's really kind of spanning a lot of different areas of opportunity.  But as far as research facilities on station, you know, there's a lot of things that are very similar to that of your normal lab here on the ground.   [00:18:23] I mean, so we talked a little bit about rodents.  So we have a rodent research habitat.  There's centrifuges, there's a 3D printer that is on station now, there is, let's see, we have a microgravity glove box that enables a wide variety of scientific discipline to include using a furnace on station.  We have an external platform.  If you want to put research on the outside of the station and test it in the extreme environment of space, that is now available to you.  There is a DNA sequencer on station.  I mean, there's so much that's going on that, you know, and again, it's not dissimilar from a lot of other lab settings that you would conduct your research in on Earth.    [00:19:03] Host: All right, okay, so lots of different options too.  And there's a lot of cool ones too.  I mean, you can put your stuff outside the station and see kind of what happens to it.  I mean, I'm guessing from like a radiation perspective, maybe from a temperature perspective, lack of pressure, or, you know, there's a lot of different things that you can find out.    [00:19:22] Patrick O’Neill: Absolutely.  Yeah.  I mean, and to your point, you know, temperature variation, radiation, levels, I mean, those are some of the big critical ones that we talk about with perspective users of those external platforms.    [00:19:35] Host: So a lot of the facilities and a lot of these kind of experiments, do they require astronauts to kind of have hands-on experience, or are there some that are just kind of running in the background?    [00:19:46] Patrick O’Neill: So that's, first of all, that's a grade segue as well too, because I think that one of the issues that we run into, both from a CASIS standpoint, National Lab, and NASA, is, you know, you can only use the astronauts for so much time when they're on station.  And so in a perfect world, is there a scenario where you're able to send research up into kind of a rack space where it's almost like a plug and play future, it's a simplistic environment where the astronaut just, again, pushes in this cartridge, so-to-speak, flips a switch, and the next thing you know, you have a science experiment that's going to be conducted for the next 30 days.  So we have a mixture of both, where there are hands-on, more astronaut-intensive investigations.  An example of that would probably be something like road research or research that's being taken place in a microgravity glove box or DNA sequencing.  But then you also have a couple of companies that have rack space on the Space Station.  And the two companies that come to mind are NanoRacks and Space Tango.   [00:20:48] And think about that as facilities that are in a position to enable inquiries from life science to material science, and they just kind of go in this rack space, so-to-speak, and they kind of sit there for 30 days, and just it really depends on what the researcher is looking for.  If they want to have a camera on the inside, if they want to have, if they want to test levels, if they want to, you know, have a light on, things like that, I mean, all of those could be configured based on the needs of the researcher.  But it's done with the intention to really simplify the process, get as much research up as possible, and not have to take away from all of the time that the astronauts are using on station for other, other endeavors that they're involved with.    [00:21:28] Host: Exactly.  And I know crew time is always just a hot commodity because they have to do so much.  I mean, just coming up next week, they have to-- and all of this week, they've really been preparing for a space walk, or I guess two this month.  And it's just, you know, that's a huge chunk of time that they have to prepare, because, you know, space walks are very I guess just labor-intensive.  They're out there for six and a half hours.  They've got hours beforehand of prep, hours afterwards of debrief.  It's just a long day, and everything has to be coordinated down to like the minute.  I guess you can even say second, but I'll just say minute to make sure that the whole time is absolutely maximized.  So they dedicate all this time beforehand, and then that, you know, they don't have as much time for research because they have to do everything up there, you know?  There's no, there's no astronaut and then a lab technician and then plumber, you know?  They are all three of those things.  So it's crazy what they have to do.  Sol I guess that's kind of helpful when things kind of run on their own.   [00:22:31] But you're right, there's stuff that, you know, if you're going to sequence DNA, you actually have to inject it.  You have to have an astronaut go in the glove box and put something in a DNA sequencer, or actually, you know, work with the rodents in the habitats.  So, I mean, finding that crew time can be a little bit challenging at times I'm guessing, right?    [00:22:51] Patrick O’Neill: It can be.  And that's why, you know, we work in partnership with NASA to really kind of understand and identify the projects that are coming down our pipeline conversely with what it is that is a priority for NASA.  So that way whenever we do send research up, we are able to maximize everyone's collective time.    [00:23:07] Host: Okay, cool.  So that thought makes me think of, or kind of lead to the whole process of getting research onboard the Space Station, right?  You said, kind of your process.  So what is that like?  Now let's say you've gone out, you've connected with an industry or with a researcher, and they want to get something out in the International Space Station.  What does that look like?    [00:23:30] Patrick O’Neill: So the way that it would work is first and foremost, if you do want to send research to the Space Station, you've got to submit a proposal.  So you have to submit a white paper that basically says, this is what I want to send to the Space Station, this is why I think the microgravity can enhance the findings of what it is that I'm presently doing on the ground.  And so we have this kind of open forum where we allow anybody to submit a white paper at anytime, and then our team will evaluate that.  And so as we are starting to evaluate these, first and foremost, the question we have to ask ourselves is, you know, does it need microgravity?  I mean, is this something that can be done in your lab settings, or, you know, is it going to make sense to be done in a microgravity environment on the Space Station?  Second of all, is it operationally feasible?  Is it something that we can put into a facility that already exists on station?  Is it something that's going to be safe to have beyond the Space Station?  We don't want to endanger the lives of the astronauts.  And then once we're able to kind of identify where this payload might end up going once it goes to station, then it passes over into kind of meat and potatoes, which is the science portion of it.   [00:24:35] Okay, you know, what is the science relevancy of this?  What is the tangible impact for benefiting life on Earth?  And then all of these are, from a science perspective, evaluated from our science team, as well as subject matter experts that are not CASIS employees, because again, at the end of the day, we are good stewards, we want to be good stewards of this incredible research platform.  You know, we don't want to be looked upon as just picking and choosing our favorite research from a Fortune 500 company.  It's about science and science relevancy.  And so once you kind of go through that portion, then is segues then into, you know, working with NASA, working with hardware partners that, again, we mentioned earlier, like the flight-certified hardware portion.  So, you know, teaming up the researcher with a flight-certified hardware partner who can, you know, take that concept and morph it into an actual experiment that can go to station, that we manifest it, that it flies up, and then it gets, the research gets conducted.  And then in some instances, the research comes back down for further evaluation.   [00:25:37] And then in other instances, it either stays on station for an extended period of time, or eventually it will be put into the signal capsule, which then burns up in the Earth's atmosphere when all the research is done on Orbital ATK mission.    [00:25:52] Host: Okay, and then the way it gets back is SpaceX, right?  SpaceX is the return vehicle?    [00:25:56] Patrick O’Neill: Right.    [00:25:56] Host: Yeah, yeah, yeah.    [00:25:56] Patrick O’Neill: Yep, so SpaceX is the return vehicle presently.  But then hopefully in a couple of years, we will be able to have our friends over at Sierra Nevada, which will equally be in a position to send research back down to the research community.    [00:26:07] Host: Oh, that's right, yeah, they have a return capability too.  Okay, cool.  Yeah, no, a lot of different options.  All right, so you get this proposal, and then you're connected with flight hardware so you can kind of fit your experiment in this flight hardware and make sure everything is going to be working.  And then you kind of work with commercial resupply company to actually send it up to the Space Station, right?    [00:26:31] Patrick O’Neill: Right, so, you know, think of SpaceX and Orbital ATK as kind of the transportation to and from.  But all of, you know, it's not as though we work directly with SpaceX or Orbital ATK.  We actually work directly with NASA to identify the various payloads that are going to be going up.  Because, again, at the end of the day, there's only a finite amount of payload space that we all have.  And so it's working with NASA to understand the research priorities that they have on a particular mission, and us then being able to sit there and say, okay, you know, we want to put these number of projects in.  How is that going to coincide with the research that NASA wants to send on this, you know, call it Orbital ATK mission?    [00:27:14] Host: Okay, cool.  Yeah, a lot of players in there.  I mean, you've got CASIS, NASA, the commercial partners, you know, flight hardware providers, researchers, Fortune 500 companies.  Oh my gosh.  This can be get pretty expansive.    [00:27:26] Patrick O’Neill: It's clear as mud, right?    [00:27:29] Host: So how has this evolved over the years?  Has this been kind of a growing thing?  Or did it kind of explode all at once?  What's the story behind this whole industry?    [00:27:39] Patrick O’Neill: I would say it's a very growing thing.  You know, I've been lucky enough to be with CASIS for just about six years now, which is the vast majority of the lifespan of the organization.  So, you know, I've been privileged to kind of see how this has evolved over time.  And, you know, I can say that when the ISS National Lab was first created, I think that there was a notion that overnight, you would just have all of these companies and researchers that are like, oh my gosh, I can't wait to send research to the Space Station.  But that wasn't the case, you know?  And I think that we realized that and recognized that very early on here at CASIS that companies didn't know that they could access station.  Their researchers didn't know they could access station, let alone why they would want to access station.  I mean, what could I learn in microgravity that I can't learn in my own lab?  So the first couple of years of the organization was not only standing ourselves up, trying to figure out who we are and how we fit in this overall Space Station landscape, working with NASA, but also trying to work with the research community to let them know why they should want to take advantage of this Space Station.   [00:28:45] So it took a couple of years to really help build up that notion of demand.  And, you know, now we're starting to get into the golden years of the Space Station, as I like to say.  And so last year was a perfect example where we had, you know, an many thanks to our partners over at SpaceX and Orbital ATK, you know, we had a terrific year of continuous research to and from station.  And from that, you were really able to see a lot of the fruits of the labor of the hard work of NASA, of the CASIS team, along with our commercial partners like, you know, NanoRacks and Space Tango who are equally kind of bringing in their own research.  And so the demand portion has kicked up exponentially over the last couple of years.  And, you know, part of it is, you know, a derivative of having some recognizable commercial brands that are now starting to send their research to station.  And part of it is also just, you know, over time, you know, enhancing how it is that we put together our pitch and educate people on how they could take advantage of station.   [00:29:46] So it's been a process, but I would say that it's been an incredibly fun and unique process for all of us to be involved with.  And, you know, now we're really able to, again, kind of enjoy the fruits of the labor.    [00:29:58] Host: Yeah, exactly.  I mean, if you think about it, it's all kind of new, right?  I mean, you think about it, things going to space.  That's a NASA thing, right?  You know, you're talking about space agencies, international partners, like these big time players in the space world.  But now, you know, now you're going to open it up to so many different people to actually send stuff to space.  And the space industry itself, I see it all the time just constantly growing and people talking about it.  It's kind of cool to see this thing kind of grow, expand and mature, I guess.    [00:30:32] Patrick O’Neill: Well, and, you know, on top of that, too, I mean, it's funny, I was reading an article the other day where they were talking about the emergence of the suborbital research community.  And, you know, one of the things that we talk about with suborbital research is that it might be a great precursor to setting the foundation for even better research on the International Space Station.  So, you know, you now even have that community that is now part of this quote unquote space race, if you will.  So there's just so much activity that's going on right now, both from a NASA standpoint, a Space Station standpoint.  You have all of these commercial launch providers that are now starting to get into the mix.  I mean, you know, you have to sit there sometimes and say, one of the reasons that they're all getting involved is because they see the opportunity, they see the demand is beginning to swell.  And the Space Station is very indicative of that.    [00:31:22] Host: Yeah, I like the way you say it, too.  It's kind of like the golden age.  But, you know, with competition comes innovation, so that's kind of exciting as well.  So, you know, kind of leading, I guess leading into that is the kinds of research that we're seeing.  Now that this industry is maturing and people are sending more and more things and there's recognizable players in the research space, you know, what kinds of research can we see go through CASIS and occur on the International Space Station?    [00:31:51] Patrick O’Neill: So, you know, again, it really spans all scientific disciplines.  But, you know, as we're kind of forecasting into 2018, you know, I guess it gives me a good opportunity to plug some of the research that we're expecting to have go up hopefully in a couple of months on the next SpaceX resupply mission.    [00:32:08] Host: Okay.    [00:32:08] Patrick O’Neill: And, you know, it really, it's kind of a diverse set.  I mean, so we have research that's looking at wound healing.  We have research that's looking at metabolic activity tracking.  We're going to be having two new facilities that are going to go on station that help to enable further research.  One of them is going to be kind of an updated centrifuge.  And so that centrifuge is going to be able to, you know, have research almost be side by side.  Maybe you have one that is, you know, reacting because of microgravity, but then you have a centrifuge right next to it, and maybe you're trying to create conditions that are similar to what it's like on Earth.  So you have this, you know, these two differing types of investigations that are now happening right next to each other.  And you're not having to do one research on the ground simultaneously with another one in space to see kind of, you know, what the reaction difference is.  Now you've got them right next to each other.  So that's kind of a cool principle for researchers to take advantage of.  Another research platform that's going to go up, it's called the missing platform.  But it's going to greatly enhance materials research investigations on the Space Station.   [00:33:12] So, you know, those are two new facilities that are going to be going up, again, adding to the already very diverse amount of facilities in research that's possible.  We even have, you know, student investigations that are going to be going up, some looking at genetics.  And then NASA's got a wide variety of payloads that are going to be going up too.  So, I mean, there's an awful lot that's happening right now.  I also want to say, plant biology research is going to be another fixture that's going to be involved in this upcoming mission.  So all sorts of stuff going on.    [00:33:43] Host: Yeah, definitely.  We actually had a couple, you know, things come back on SpaceX 13.  You know, when you're talking about research going up, and then, you know, some of it kind of stays there, some of it burns up, some of it comes back, there's plants that were actually on SpaceX 13, right?    [00:33:58] Patrick O’Neill: There were plants, yeah.  There was a couple of different plant biology experiments that went up.  One from an academic institution, and then one from a very recognizable commercial brand.  But, you know, I think that, you know, plant biology research is a great example that it spans all sectors.  You know, NASA has been doing plant biology research on station and on shuttle for years.  I mean, you know, the Veggie project is something that has gotten great visibility as astronauts try to get beyond low Earth orbit, they're going to need to harvest or create their own food supplies.  So NASA has been involved in that.  But then you have academic researchers who are looking to just kind of ask those basic questions of how do plants react when, you know, you no longer have gravity as a variable?  Which ways do they grow?  Why do they grow that way?  You know, what happens when you don't have that much sunlight on them, you know, how do they react?  But then you also have commercial companies that are now sending plant biology research experiments to station with the intention of improving agricultural processes here on the ground.  But, you know, again, it's really hitting on so many different areas now.   [00:35:02] I mean, again, whether it's government organizations, academic researchers, commercial companies.  And all of that, in some ways, is kind of what you want for the National Lab.  You want a variety of thoughts and ideas for how to tackle various types of research.    [00:35:15] Host: Yeah, definitely.  Well, Veggie is a great example because Veggie is a facility, right?    [00:35:20] Patrick O’Neill: Right.    [00:35:20] Host: So it's a place where if you need to do plant research, this is where you're going to do it.  It's one of the places on the Space Station where you can do it.  And it's just from, you know, kind of playing with plants in space that they've come up with, all right, we're going to use, we're going to use lights, these LED lights, and we're going to use these things called pillows, and they're going to grow in these pillows where it has all the soil and nutrients and nutrient delivery system.  And then they just came up with this place.  And now boom, if you want to grow a plant or see what happens to a plant, this is where you're going to do it.  And, you know, the one you said before was Outredgeous red romaine lettuce.  That was actually the first time that Americans ate lettuce on the station.  That was pretty cool.    [00:36:01] Patrick O’Neill: That was pretty cool.  Well, and, you know, so projects like that bring I think great visibility for, you know, exploratory purposes.  But then there's also a lot of projects that are happening on station that have kind of a dual usage or, you know, NASA and CASIS and the ISS National Lab working together in partnership.  And one of the ones that just came back too was a run research investigation where, you know, think of NASA as kind of being the leaders of the rodent portion of it, and then the National Lab working on kind of the research side of it.  So the Houston Methodist Research Institute partnered with pharmaceutical giant Novartis, and they were looking at implantable chips in rodent research, again, with the hope of ultimately improving life on Earth, whether that be through cancer understandings, as well as things like osteoporosis and diabetes.    [00:36:56] Host: Whoa.  Okay, so it's a device that can actually be implanted and kind of help out with that, right?    [00:37:01] Patrick O’Neill: Right, and hopefully better monitor conditions within your body.    [00:37:05] Host: Yeah, yeah, yeah.    [00:37:06] Patrick O’Neill: Then also, you know, speaking of something like that, we also had another one that just came back down that was a glucose biosensor that was looking to improve day-to-day diabetes management.  So the efficacy of insulin being, you know, disseminated into the body to make sure that it has max potency.    [00:37:25] Host: Okay, yeah.  So a lot of like, you know, a lot of these medical kind of industries kind of in this space, right?    [00:37:32] Patrick O’Neill: Yeah, I would say, you know, think about it like this too.  It's almost, you know, like low-hanging fruit, if you will.  So we see an awful lot of pharmaceutical companies that have been involved in life science research on station.  But again, a lot of that kind of pre-dates the National Lab concept, and was really kind of harkening back to the research that NASA was doing, specifically on the astronauts, living and working in space.  And then, you know, some of those, some of those basic understandings now being passed over and allowing the private sector to be able to take advantage of some of those early findings and now incorporate that into their research that can hopefully create therapeutics or drugs that can improve patient care here on Earth.    [00:38:12] Host: Nice.  All right, so the glucose biosensor one, that one, I saw a picture of it.  It's like super tiny, right?  It can fit on your finger.    [00:38:20] Patrick O’Neill: Fits the little guy.    [00:38:22] Host: Yeah, so my question is how-- what about microgravity makes the Space Station a good place to test that tiny little sensor?    [00:38:32] Patrick O’Neill: So it's not so much the sensor itself, but I think that it was more focused on the fluid flow of, you know, kind of shooting out that insulin and making sure that it is as efficient as possible.  So, you know, you send, you know, you send this thing up with the insulin or a mockup thereof, and again, kind of see how that flows in a microgravity environment.  Again, done with the intention of really maximizing every time that it kind of shoots out into your body.    [00:39:02] Host: That's right.  Okay, yeah, making sure that it's consistent, right?  No matter where it is or what you're doing.    [00:39:07] Patrick O’Neill: Not just consistent, but, you know, that it's also giving you the most powerful and most effective kind of shoot so that way it gets into your blood as fast as possible, and you're able to kind of go about living your life in a normal capacity as opposed to, you know, maybe waiting 15 to 20 minutes.  Maybe this is going to be much more instantaneous into your body.    [00:39:27] Host: Yeah, okay.  Yeah, there's a lot of cool studies.  Another one on SpaceX 13 that I'm thinking of.  They are actually trying to manufacture fiber optic filaments, right?  And try to figure out, you know, like space manufacturing, right?  So I guess are they trying to build a space manufacturing kind of industry?  Or just kind of test its capability on Earth and kind of the same thing, right?  Make sure it's as powerful, as consistent, that kind of thing.    [00:39:56] Patrick O’Neill: Right, yeah.  So our partners over at Made In Space, they are also quite famous for having the 3D printer on station.  They kind of wanted to take that next step into looking at on-orbit manufacturing capabilities.  And so, you know, that's kind of where you're looking at fiber optic technology, which, you know, could potentially enhance, you know, I guess a lot of the things that might be happening within the advanced communication, or, you know, DOD type communities.  So, you know, Made In Space was looking to see, you know, how do these filaments react in a microgravity environment?  Can I grow them, you know, more purely so that maybe it's something that is grown in space, or, you know, harvested, if you will, even though it is fiber optic technology, but then taking that back down to Earth and actually selling that.  So, yeah, I mean, how can we use the Space Station as an ever-evolving platform, not only for research, but also, again, for on over manufacturing capabilities.  It really is kind of an interesting way to think about the Space Station as we continue to move forward.   [00:40:57] And there's going to be other companies that are equally looking to do similar types of on over manufacturing capabilities in the future.  And that's almost, again, when we're talking about the Station, that's what makes it to exciting right now.  It's not just research, and it's not just, you know, the commercial companies that are sending research out, or academic researchers, but it's companies being able to leverage microgravity to enhance their business findings, and, you know, validate why it is that we need to continue to have a commercial presence in low Earth orbit, potentially beyond this Space Station.    [00:41:29] Host: That's right.  You know, one of the things that always comes to mind when it talks about growing stuff in space, the thing that I always think about is protein crystals, because that was kind of-- that one was kind of, I guess you can call surprising, because they actually grew differently, and I guess you could say almost more perfectly, because they didn't have stuff weighing down on them.  Was it a positive finding?    [00:41:53] Patrick O’Neill: It's a very positive finding.    [00:41:55] Host: Yeah.    [00:41:55] Patrick O’Neill: So, you know, there's a variety of companies that have been doing protein crystallography research, or academic researchers that are looking at protein crystals.  And I think that you actually kind of hit it on the head.  You know, in a microgravity environment, you're able to grow crystals in a more uniformed or perfect manner, which would potentially allow for you to dig in and better understand the genetic makeup of some sort of a, you know, a protein.  And, you know, one that comes to mind for me that has gone up multiple times is we have partners over at Merck Research Laboratories, and they have sent three separate, I want to say, protein crystallography experiments, and it's being done with the intention of improving the efficacy of KEYTRUDA, which is an FDA-approved drug that is now done for cancer patients.  And so right now, even though the drug is already on the market, if you go and, you know, you get shot up with this, you're basically in the hospital for an entire day.  So what Paul Rickert, the lead researcher over at Merck is trying to do with these protein crystallography experiments, is grow these crystals at a better rate, a larger rate, so that, again, he can dig into the genetic makeup of these proteins and find a way to improve the potency of this drug so that instead of you, as a patient, being at a hospital all day, you know, maybe you just go see your doctor, and he gives you a shot, and 10 minutes later, you're walking out the door, 30 minutes later, you're out playing golf.   [00:43:20] I mean, you know, it's about trying to make your life a little bit easier.  But, yeah, so cool stuff like that with a protein crystallography experiment.  But yeah, again, it's really trying to make things a little bit larger so that you can dig into them and look at genetic structures of proteins in a new and novel way.  And microgravity, it's not to say that you can't do protein crystallography on the ground.  But microgravity has shown a propensity for having much larger crystals, because, again, you're no longer having the push and pull of gravity as a vector.  Now you have microgravity around you, and it really allows for these crystals to grow in much more of a natural state, so-to-speak.    [00:44:01] Host: Super cool.  I love it.  You know, so you've got things that are actually growing I guess more perfectly, and you said larger in space, but I know that using the Space Station can actually make things a little bit less expensive too.  I think a good example is satellites, actually launching satellites.    [00:44:20] Patrick O’Neill: Yeah.    [00:44:20] Host: Do you guys work with companies to launch satellites from the Space Station?    [00:44:24] Patrick O’Neill: So there is one company in particular that we work with who, you know, not only do they have rack space on the Space Station, not only do they have an external platform on station, but they also have the ability to send cube satellites into low Earth orbit from the Space Station.  And that's a company called NanoRacks.  And so we work in partnership with them.  All of their research that flies to the ISS flies under the ISS National Laboratory manifest.  And so we work with them to identify, you know, which cube satellites they want to send, why they want to send it, and the timeframe behind it.  And so, you know, that's a perfect example of it's not just CASIS as, you know, going and securing research.  It's some of these partners like a NanoRacks or a Space Tango who are working with researchers, and equally kind of talking about why it is that they would want to send their research to Station, or [inaudible] research from Station.  And so NanoRacks is the entity that we work heavily with who is responsible for, again, deploying those cube satellites.    [00:45:29] Host: And they're called cube satellites because they are much smaller than like a satellite that you would normally think about, right?  When you think of satellite, you think of like this giant floating dish in low Earth orbit, right?  But they are much smaller.    [00:45:41] Patrick O’Neill: They are much smaller.  You know, think about it as, you know, your satellite being housed in a shoebox.  And that shoebox just being shot out of the Space Station.  And, you know, maybe it gets a little bit bigger once it gets outside of the Space Station parameters, but maybe it doesn't as well.  I mean, it just really depends on what the researcher is looking to try to do and how big they want to go.    [00:46:04] Host: So what do these small satellites do?  What are they capable of?    [00:46:08] Patrick O’Neill: Wow, you know, what aren't they capable of, you know?  I mean, so, you know, I think when you think of satellites, the typical idea would be, you know, Earth monitoring in some capacity.  But, you know, there was one that went up, I want to say it was on SpaceX-CRS13, or Orbital ATK-8, but it was actually E. Coli was put in a satellite and sent into low Earth orbit to kind of see how it reacts and morphs in a microgravity environment.  But, you know, obviously it's being [inaudible] away from the Space Station.  So I don't really know what the findings of that were.  But something like that is pretty doggone cool, where, you know, it's not just, you know, true satellite technology, but, you know, now, you know, sending life science into, in a cube satellite, and seeing how that reacts in the extreme environment of space.    [00:46:57] Host: Sweet.  So there's like this fleet of shoeboxes just kind of circling around here.  That's what I'm imagining.  I don't know.  They're all doing all different kinds of stuff, right?    [00:47:07] Patrick O’Neill: They are doing all sorts of cool work, yeah.    [00:47:09] Host: Yeah, yeah, very cool.  All right, yeah, lots of different, lots of different research going on, and CASIS is kind of at the center of that, kind of managing this back and forth of research, going up and down and all around.  So that's awesome.  I did want to kind of end with this cool contest that you've got going on right now.  Do you want to talk a little bit about that?    [00:47:30] Patrick O’Neill: Right, so, you know, I get the fun job, I guess, where, you know, I get to go out and talk with you about research at a very high level.  But then also I get the opportunity to work alongside some truly unique partners who can bring great visibility to the Space Station.  And also, you know, I think that one of the areas I forgot to touch on earlier was that one of the key functions of CASIS and the National Lab is to help inspire and engage the next generation of scientists and engineers.  And so every year what I'll typically do is I'll work with a unique brand to develop one mission patch that represents all ISS National Laboratory research.  So last year, for instance, we worked with Lucasfilm who developed a Star Wars themed mission patch, which was pretty doggone cool.  And then in 2016, though, and this is kind of where, you know, a longwinded response, where we're kind of getting with this contest, in 2016, we partnered with Marvel, and they developed a mission patch that featured Rocket and Groot from the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise.    [00:48:27] Host: Cool.    [00:48:27] Patrick O’Neill: And so what I was hoping to try to do out of that was not just have a mission patch, which brings, you know, some awareness to the Space Station.  But is there a way to create an actionable item that we can take from this mission patch and spread it to the masses?  And so what we ended up doing is working with Marvel to create a stem competition that is focused on Rocket and Groot and the characteristics associated with them.  So we now have a contest that is live for students in the United States aged 13 to 18.  And, you know, they can just simply go and submit flight concepts on the characteristics of Rocket and Groot, and, you know, for instance, you have Rocket, who is general innovation, and, you know, enabling technology development, material science.  But then you have Groot, and he is kind of like the personification of plant biology or regeneration.  So students, you know, how could you do something on the Space Station that's focused on regeneration or seeing how plants or something like that react in space?   [00:49:30] So, you know, we're really trying to encourage students to think about their favorite superheroes in a new and different way, and equally link that to how the Space Station could create some fun stem opportunities.    [00:49:42] Host: Cool.  Okay, so they're designing research for each of these teams, or is it like a set, a set thing that they have to accomplish, like what's the whole contest?    [00:49:53] Patrick O’Neill: So the contest itself is actually fairly basic, where it's truly submitting a white paper.  You know, if you want to, if you're interested in material science, and, you know, thinking about, you know, how Rocket would want to do research on the Space Station, you know, what would you send to the Space Station?  Why would you send it?  What could you learn that you can't learn here on Earth?  Conversely, you know, if you're a fan of regeneration, you know, how can microgravity enhance regenerative medicine?  You know, submit a concept on what you want to send, why you want to send it.  I mean, it's basic, yet at the same time, what we're going to end up doing when the contest is done is we're going to select two concepts, one from Team Rocket, one from Team Groot, and we're going to turn those concepts into actual experiments, and they will launch to the Space Station later this year.    [00:50:44] Host: Ah, sweet.  Yeah, there's your actionable item, right?  An actual thing that a student design that is going on the Space Station.    [00:50:51] Patrick O’Neill: Yep, an actual, an actual item.  And, you know, the cool thing for the students, too, is they're going to have the chance to, you know, not only put this concept, you know, together, but they're going to work alongside our hardware partners, our engineering partners, to make this, you know, something that can truly be turned into an actual experiment.  So, you know, you're going to get an awful lot of practical application if you're a young student.  And, you know, I can't think of a better thing to put on your resume than to sit there and say that, you know, over the summer or over the second semester, I got a chance to put together an experiment that flew to the International Space Station.    [00:51:25] Host: Man, I wish I could put something like that on my resume.  That would be cool.    [00:51:28] Patrick O’Neill: Well, there's a reason why, you know, I went to a state school and not a smart person's school.    [00:51:33] Host: Hey, me too, man.  I'm a marketing PR kind of major too.  So I look up to these guys for sure, because what they can accomplish is just astounding.    [00:51:44] Patrick O’Neill: Absolutely.    [00:51:44] Host: Especially to get students involved this early, you know?  Because if I had known, you know, there was a Rocket and Groot kind of contest and I could submit something, you know, maybe I would have went the science route.  Well, looking back, I don't know.  We'll see.  I'm happy where I am now.  I'm happy where I am now.  But still, it's just, it sounds like an amazing opportunity.    [00:52:02] Patrick O’Neill: It does.  And, you know, I guess I have to actually give it the official title for the contest, or the challenge, is the Guardians of the Galaxy Space Station Challenge.  So, I mean, if I'm doing shameless plugs, then, you know, if you are a student, if you're a teacher and you want to pass this over to your students, if you're a parent and you want to pass this over to your child, you know, I would say that go to the following website, spacestationexplorers.org/marvel, and you'll be able to find not only information on the contest, but you'll also be able to find examples of research that's been done, both from a materials science standpoint technology development, and then also plant biology regeneration.  So it's kind of a one-stop shop that is able to provide as much information as possible for the students to be dangerous and submit their concepts.    [00:52:48] Host: How long is the contest going on?    [00:52:50] Patrick O’Neill: I wish I could say it's going to be going on in, you know, like infinitely, but it's not.  It's going to be pretty quick turnaround.  So the contest runs until the 31st.  So we have about a week and a half to go.  But, again, what I would say is that it's a pretty basic submittal process.  So, you know, we're not asking for the Moon here, you know, we're asking for a couple of paragraphs.  And, you know, who knows?  Maybe your paragraphs are going to be the one that gets selected, and you could be that lucky person that gets to watch your payload fly to the Space Station, and, you know, we can go and spread that to the masses and let people know all the cool research that's possible on Station.    [00:53:24] Host: Yeah, definitely.  Okay, yeah, we're definitely going to have to turn this episode around real quick so we can get this out, so we can get it out during the contest, give people a couple extra days and a little extra promotion for it.  That's so cool to send stuff to the International Space Station.  Among all this other great research that's already up there and constantly going up and down, like you said, the golden age of research onboard the International Space Station.  Patrick, thank you so much for coming on and talking about the National Lab, and just explaining how this whole process, how this whole, I could say industry at this point, how this whole thing works.  So I really appreciate you coming on.    [00:53:59] Patrick O’Neill: Absolutely, Gary.  This was a lot of fun.  And we touched on a lot of different subjects.  And hopefully we didn't confuse everyone too much.    [00:54:07] Host: I love this.  So this is definitely my world.  So I really appreciate it.  And we'll kind of reiterate those links that you said at the end there after the credits here.  So once again, thanks, Patrick, and good luck with the contest.    [00:54:21] Patrick O’Neill: Thank you very much.  Happy Friday.    [00:54:23] [ Music ]    [00:54:49] Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So today, we talked with Mr. Patrick O'Neill about CASIS and everything about the industry that's kind of growing as we talked about during this, during this podcast.  But at the end there, he was talking about a contest that's going on right now.  So I'm going to kind of start with that.  So again, that link that he talked about is spacestationexplorers.org/marvel.  You can go there, and then they kind of give the outline of the contest that's going on and what you need to do to submit your proposal, and as Patrick said, the white paper.  Again, that contest is running through January 31st.  So make sure to turn those around pretty quick.  You've got a couple more days.  But it's a pretty cool contest.  And at the end of it, you may get to have your research proposal turned into actual research that goes on the International Space Station.  That's pretty cool.  So if you want to learn more just about CASIS in general, because, you know, we talked about a lot of the research that's going on, all the time going up and down, that's iss-casis.org, and that's their website.   [00:55:53] You can find out just more about that industry, and then, or about that business, a little bit more about the industry, too, but then all of the different research that's going up and down.  So on social media, CASIS is @isscasis.  Twitter is @iss_casis.  And Instagram is @iss_casis, as well.  Otherwise, you can find me, follow the International Space Station, as we say, almost every show.  That's International Space Station on Facebook.  And then @space_station@iss.  That's Twitter and Instagram, as we always say.  And then on the ISS accounts, if you use the #asknasa on your favorite platform, you can submit an idea for an episode of the podcast, or maybe ask a question.  Even if you do, honestly, we've done it before, we've seen questions and said, hey, that would be an awesome episode.  Actually, I think the space suits episode.  And then, yeah, yeah, a couple of them.  And I think we have actually more coming up.  Just make sure to mention in the #asknasa that it's for Houston We Have a Podcast.   [00:56:54] So this podcast episode was recorded on January 19th, 2018, thanks to Alex Perryman and Greg Weisman and the folks at Kenney Space Center, Lauren Mathers, everyone over there, thanks so much for connecting me and CASIS, me and Patrick today, and making this all come together.

        description: "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center. This is Episode 119, \"Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, The Tools.\" I'm Pat Ryan. On this podcast, we talk with scientists, engineers, astronauts, and other folks about their part in America's space exploration program. And today, we're going to talk about a typically NASA sort of thing -- how we develop unique tools to complete the on-orbit repair of an amazing space particle detector which is hot on the trail of dark matter and dark energy. Yeah, it's what we do. In 1994, Nobel Laureate Professor Samuel Ting from MIT proposed the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. You'll hear us call it the AMS. He had in mind a particle physics detector to be deployed on the International Space Station, which itself wasn't even flying yet, and which would gather information about cosmic particles traveling through space. He was searching for antimatter, and dark matter, and keys to the origins of the universe. It was delivered to the International Space Station on the next-to-last space shuttle mission in May of 2011, and it's been gathering and gathering more than 146 billion cosmic ray events, give or take. Check out our podcast Episode 117, with space station Assistant Program Scientist Brandon Reddell for more on the science of the AMS. Well, the AMS today is ready for some upgrades to extend its life. That means spacewalks by station astronauts. The thing is, AMS was not designed to be repaired on orbit, or have its parts replaced in space, as was the case for another iconic piece of NASA science hardware, the Hubble Space Telescope, and those on-orbit upgrades and repairs worked out really well. So the spacewalk experts at the Johnson Space Center here in Houston tagged in some colleagues at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, the home of Hubble, to figure out how to do this job. In the process of the figuring out, they realized they didn't have the tools they needed for all the work. No one had them. They didn't exist. So they created them, and that's our story today. I got a chance to talk with three of the engineers involved -- Justin Cassidy from Goddard, and Heather Bergman and Drew Hood from Johnson -- about the development, and fabrication, and testing of more than 20 brand-new tools to allow spacewalking astronauts to keep AMS in business for as long as the station keeps flying. OK then, here we go.  [ Music ]  Host: From the \"one of these things does not belong with the other department\" is, in this case, me, because I am not a spacewalk engineer, or an engineer of any kind, frankly, and I don't play one on television. And I didn't even stay in a special hotel chain last night, but I really get turned on by stories about how machines work. So I'm really excited to get to talk to all of you today. Heather Bergman and Drew Hood work here at NASA's Johnson Space Center in the -- and why do we do this to ourselves? In the [Extravehicular Activity] EVA and Advanced Exploration Tools Office, which is a part of the Tools, Equipment, and Habitability Systems Branch of the Crew and Thermal Systems Division. Good for you guys. And Justin Cassidy works in the Satellite Servicing Project Division at Goddard Space Flight Center, and he's been involved in planning and execution of most of the Hubble Space Telescope repair missions. So by way of introduction, I wanted to ask if each of you would just tell me a little about yourself, about your own background, how you got to NASA, maybe some of what you've been working on before, and how you got involved in the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer spacewalk project. Heather?  Heather Bergman: I'm Heather Bergman. For the past four years, I've been the JSC EVA tools Project Manager for the AMS repair tools. I started mechanical engineering at the University of Toledo in Ohio. I started co-oping in the car industry. I always wanted to design sports cars, and after spending a semester doing that, I realized that world was too political for me. So oddly, I came to work for the government [laughter]. I worked at Glenn Research Center, NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, and after graduating, I worked there for a year before I moved down here. I started working shuttle repair tools, return-to-flight for STS-114, and did that through the end of the Space Shuttle program, and then moved over to ISS tools. So International Space Station -- anything that goes out the door, any of our new builds comes through our office. So worked that for a while, so when AMS showed up, we were the office that was -- went through first, I guess. And we've been working AMS since the beginning, since they decided that they needed to go outside and do the repair on a spacewalk.  Host: Did you say four years you've been working on this?  Heather Bergman: Four years for AMS.  Host: My goodness. We'll find out why here in a minute.  Heather Bergman: Yes.  Host: Drew Hood, tell me about your --  Drew Hood: Yeah, my name's Drew Hood. I studied mechanical engineering at Purdue University, and I honestly had no idea what even the last A in NASA stood for [laughter]. I was interested in biomedical engineering. So I was going to Purdue, and as a freshman, I got introduced to the co-op program, as Heather mentioned earlier, where you go to school a semester, work a semester. So I was focused on trying to land a job in the Midwest with a biomedical company, and thankfully, my dad said, \"Hey, why don't you interview with NASA as well, just to kind of round out your interview session?\" And so, thankfully, I did that, and five years and six co-op tours later, I landed a full-time job here at NASA.  Host: Man.  Drew Hood: And so, I came into the tools group that I currently work in today, and really, really enjoy that work. So I've worked on a lot of different projects from NEEMO, [NASA extreme environment mission operations] which is an underwater exploration analogue off the coast of Florida, where astronauts go down and do some training, building hardware for that, to certifying a GoPro camera for the crew to take out, and take good video, and for the International Space Station. But the last -- Heather said, the last four of my ten years here at NASA as a full-time employee have been focused on AMS.  Host: My goodness. Justin Cassidy, you've been involved in spacewalking for longer than that.  Justin Cassidy: It certainly has that. So I'm Justin Cassidy. I've been with NASA for over 30 years, so I'm going to age myself there. Like -- I'm an engineer as well, mechanical engineer. I went through school at -- in Washington, D.C., a Catholic University, and that is just down the street from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, just across the line. So it was always my desire to go up the street, if you would, and find employment at NASA Goddard, and I did. And I worked a couple of early development programs at NASA. I started working on this thing that people were kind of getting together called space station. So I worked really, really early days of pre-planning with what our contribution was to that. I worked another program called the Flight Tower Robotic Service, which was basically putting a robotic arm in the shuttle cargo bay, and showing what you could do robotics-wise. So I do have a tie to robotics. I had a great opportunity back in 1994 to work on this program called Hubble Space Telescope after they had discovered that there was an issue with the mirror on Hubble. And conducting that -- that servicing SM1 repair, it definitely was something interested-- I had availability to get a part of that team. And so, I worked Hubble -- four out of five servicing missions for Hubble, much in a systems role supporting that project, also supporting the EVA folks developing critical tools, I would say, for servicing Hubble. Basically, Hubble was meant to be serviced, visited by astronauts, and upgraded, so we did that over a number of years. And the beauty about having Hubble Space Telescope, and its ability to be upgraded, was – is that as technologies mature, those upgraded components could be replaced over the years. So better instruments, better cameras, better tape recorders --  Host: Or replacements for things that broke.  Justin Cassidy: -- or replacements for things that failed before they were expected to last. So that became a very great opportunity for myself. The last servicing mission, SM4, was very unique in that we went beyond the -- what they call ORU box level change-out. We actually were having astronauts open up instruments and do technician-level work, replacing a board about the size of 8-1/2 x 11 sheet of paper. And that was totally something new that helped us -- what we're going into.  Host: You said it was four years ago that somebody said, \"Oh, you, come talk about the AMS.\" At the point that this first presented itself, what was the problem? What was going on with AMS that spacewalks were needed for it?  Heather Bergman: Well, they -- they started out having some spikes on their pumps. So the pumps are -- they move cooling fluid through AMS. So they keep things cool that are supposed to be cool. They keep things warm that are supposed to be warm, and it just moves things around. Think of it as the air conditioning for the system.  Host: And it has -- it -- both directions, because the thing is mounted on the outside of the International Space Station, so it's going through times where there's sun and times when they're in dark. So it's got to maintain a steady level temperature.  Heather Bergman: Correct. So it was starting to have trouble maintaining those temperatures. So they wanted to go out and fix that, so they started with putting a little extra blanket up near those -- some sections to keep it a little warmer in there, and that didn't quite do everything. So they started to look more and more into what needed to be done, and they decided that the pumps that moved that fluid throughout AMS needed to be replaced. And AMS was not designed to be serviced like Hubble was. It was designed to go up for maybe three years or so, get some science, and then be done. Well, nine years later, it's getting such amazing science that they want to keep going. So even though it's well past its life, they've asked us to go do a spacewalk and fix something that was not meant to be fixed.  Host: Well, and it's still got more to do, because the scientists behind it are still not publishing their final findings yet. So they still want to gather more data. So I guess this was not just another assignment.  Heather Bergman: No.  Drew Hood: No, for me, definitely not. I was -- as I said earlier, I've only been here ten years full-time, and four of that have been worked on AMS. So I was brought in as a pretty green engineer. I had had a lot of experience in, like, the development world, doing kind of quick-and-dirty development projects, but not the rigors of a full-flight project. So I was brought in, and kind of shadowed Heather here, and have grown over the past four years, which have been awesome.  Host: It would seem to me, not knowing any of this that you guys do, that you have two problems, and it's the one that we've mentioned, the fact that this was not designed to be worked on in this way, in space. And it's also not here for you to play with, right? I mean, its 250 miles up, and moving pretty fast.  Heather Bergman: Yeah.  Host: What do you do in a situation like that? How do you start to approach this problem?  Heather Bergman: So we just finished a series of spacewalks replacing something that was meant to be replaced on space station. We just replaced the BCDUs, a battery, something --  Host: Charge-Discharge Unit—   Heather Bergman: Yes. So these weren't meant to do that. So you go in, and we've looked at -- we looked at all of the drawings, and all the pictures. We looked at hundreds of pictures and drawings to try to figure out the best way to get inside of AMS. AMS has a nice hard shield on the outside of it to protect anybody from getting into these things. You don't want any micrometeoroids to puncture anything that is important. So it's shielded. So we had to go find a way to get inside, and you look at all of these photos, and videos, and drawings to try to figure out the best way to get inside, and talk to all the people who made it.  Justin Cassidy: So, Pat, there's a very large lesson learned, going back to -- so I'll talk about often is the Hubble, Hubble space servicing, basically. And we -- the division I report to at Goddard Space Flight Center has invested significant amount of efforts to work through all the Hubble servicing missions for success, and we are now also relying on proving that you could do the same thing as an astronaut with a robot. So we've -- we have put some experiments up onto space station with specialized robotic tools for performing servicing repair, to show that, yes, a robot and an astronaut can do it. Maybe one is better than the other, but certainly, the capability is there. And we have been working a lot with satellite operators and vendors creating satellites, basically saying that the most important thing you could do is take photographs of your hardware. That is of utmost importance. So when you get there, there is no surprise, or less surprise when you need to do the work on that particular repair.  Heather Bergman: And when you think at home, you measure twice and cut once, right?  Host: That's what I've heard.  Heather Bergman: Well, I hope we measured twice before we launched AMS, because there's no more measuring to be done.  Host: Right.  Drew Hood: And one of the best things that we were able to do was to use spare parts, and build some mockups. So we actually decided to build -- of what we had around, we were able to piece part together -- I think they call it Woody [laughter]. It's a half-wooden, half-metal mockup over in building nine that we --  Host: But its parents love it just the same. [Laughter]   Drew Hood: Yeah, they do. They do. So it's -- we were able to train some astronauts on it, and we were able to actually look at it to develop some of our tools. We went over as engineers at the beginning and said, \"Hey, what do we think we can use to get into some of this worksite, and do some of this challenging stuff?\" So while we may not have the real one here, there were some spare parts, and we were able to create a -- one that we could play with.  Host: And just to make sure I understand -- because, Justin, you mentioned the possibility of a robotic -- of robots being able to make repairs. Is that being used in this case?  Justin Cassidy: Certainly not in this case.  Host: OK.  Justin Cassidy: Just a reference for similarity between repairs. No matter what you're trying to work on, photo documentation is certainly a very large precedence that we'd like to put out there, that is very, very important, as well as drawings, and CAD [Computer aided design] models, and having spare parts are really critical and essential for reducing your risk for any potential issue we'd have during a repair.  Host: And it sounds like you guys had lots of cooperation from the AMS people, who provided you the tools, or the toys, in order to figure out how to do the repair that had to be done.  Heather Bergman: Absolutely. We've gone and -- since we don't have the actual hardware here to go measure, we've looked at all the paperwork they put together over the years that they were building it, and looked at any measurement they made, any picture they took, and anything we can use in there to make sure that our hardware is going to fit properly when it gets up there. We've done everything we can to look at all that paperwork, to make sure it happens.  Host: How long were you working at this before you started to come to the realization that you didn't have all the hardware that you needed for this, that it didn't exist, that there were things that you -- that you wanted to get at that you didn't have tools for, or didn't have tools in space for?  Justin Cassidy: Pat, let me ask Heather.  Host: Yeah.   Justin Cassidy: During the -- since we've been doing this so long, during the course, the actual worksite changed --  Host: Yes, it did.  Justin Cassidy:  Three times, at least, for where our target was, where we were going to adapt into the system in order to create this life extension for AMS.  Host: The AMS didn't move.  Heather Bergman: No, but where we were going to repair it moved. So there are a couple of cooling loops, and we're going to repair one of them. So we started off on the port side of AMS, and that was a very challenging worksite. And as we were working with the AMS project office, and their collaboration, they were able to come up with some other places that we could go in and look. So after we had thought about how do we get into this place, and spent some time looking at that, we completely changed our worksite to the starboard side of AMS, which is a little --  Host: As your access point?  Heather Bergman: -- mm-hmm, is a little more open, still not open from what we would normally want to have, but much more open than the previous area. So yeah, we've moved around a couple of times, and changed the general repair scenario.  Host: Was there any thought given to, \"well, let's just pick it up off the truss and hold it out here so that we could get at it\"?  Heather Bergman: Absolutely, yeah, we thought about that as well. We can't fly a new one anymore, because we don't have the capabilities of shuttle to fly something that large, but everything was on the table. Maybe we need to pick it up and hold it up for a while, while we give the crew good access. We thought about it all.  Host: Install foot restraints, so that they could go up to it and get at any side of it.  Heather Bergman: Yeah, we thought about it.  Host: But we're not going to do that this time.  Heather Bergman: No.  Justin Cassidy: I mean, one thing was very for certain -- that they approached us. Could we actually come up with methodologies for getting to the worksite, to open the worksite, perform the worksite? We couldn't come back with, \"oh, no, we can't do it.\" So we had to find a solution. There was no \"no\" in this condition. We had to find a way, and by the end, we all found a very great way, I think.  Heather Bergman: And I think as tool engineers, kind of our job is to not say no. They come to us when things become really difficult, and say, \"OK, can you make a tool to do this?\" And that's one of my favorite things, is being able to create a tool to do the impossible.  Host: If it was easy, they'd have asked me. [Laughter]  Drew Hood: And I guess I want to say one of the robots we are using on this mission, though, is the robotic arm. So the robotic arm -- you mentioned foot restraints. So that is a big, key component to get to this worksite, because we need to be able to position people in the right spot. Because this worksite was never meant to be worked on. So there aren't the convenient handrails in all the places that you normally find on station. Like, on station, the handrails are numbered. Like, there's a -- they have a number on them, and you can actually walk down the station. They plan out exactly where they're going to put their hands. On this one, they --  Host: And one handrail at a time.  Drew Hood: One handrail at a time, yes. And so, we didn't have that on the side of AMS where we're working, and so, we had to use the robotic arm, and the foot restraint to get the crew in the spots where they could actually do the tasks that are needed.  Host: What kind of things were you finding that you -- that made you say, \"We don't have the tool to do this”? Can you give me an example of what -- what kind of things were you encountering?  Heather Bergman: Well, Drew was just talking about handrails being all over station. Without gravity to hold you in place, you've got -- you need something to grab onto. Well, there's no handrails, so Drew and I worked on the team that built three new handrails to attach to things that are not meant to have handrails attached to them. So after Justin's team removed some of the debris shield to get us access into the cavity, we tried to look at any little feature that we could grab onto, to put a handrail on. And when you put a handrail on, it's not just something that needs to take five or ten pounds. It's 125 pounds minimum. So it's -- you need to find some beefy structure, which may or may not be there, so you have to get creative with how you're going to grab onto things.  Host: Well, I mean, it's got to take the weight not only of the astronaut, but the suit that the astronaut is wearing, plus any other hardware they may have with them, right? That's 500 pounds.  Heather Bergman: The loads that they've put into it -- well, they don't weigh anything in space. They do have some mass.  Host: Mass -- thank you.  Heather Bergman: But they move around, and so, generally, we say that 125 pounds is a kick load. So if they kind of push off of something, or bump into it, 125 pounds is kind of where we aim for, for most of our hardware. Handrails tend to go a little higher, especially if the crew's going to be -- their safety on them, but --  Justin Cassidy: So Pat, without these crew rates that Heather and Drew have been talking about, it would be very difficult for the crew member to do their work at the worksite, unrestrained, without being in the foot restraints. So it gives them a lot more control, using the tools that we have created for them in order to conduct the repair.  Host: In general, without talking about -- again, maybe not one particular tool, but what kind of process do you have to go through? I am assuming, just because I've been around here for a while, that it's going to be really detailed, and every step of the way's got to be documented, and there are 1000 people you never heard of who are here to tell you how you should change what you wanted to do, that it's a really difficult process to get through. Right?  Heather Bergman: Yeah, absolutely. On our side --  Host: Give me a sense of it.  Heather Bergman: -- so we -- some of the things we're looking at -- we're -- so we're doing plumbing. We're replacing the pumps and fixing the air conditioning system. So there are tools out there that can be used to cut into stainless steel lines, and to swage back onto those lines, and do these things. They're just not friendly for an astronaut in a spacesuit. So where we started with a lot of our tools is, \"Is there an easy tool that I can go buy at the store that might do this job?\" And even if I can't buy something that'll do this job, can I get an idea of what -- the industry's already gone off and found the best widget to do this. Can I take that widget and redesign it so that it can be used in a spacesuit?  Host: Did you find any you could buy?  Heather Bergman: We found ones that we could use some of [laughter], but even if you can use some of -- we had some bolt-cutters that are -- half of them are something that we were able to buy, but the other half -- you need to put nice, friendly handles on them for the crew to use, and --  Host: Just would've been easier.  Heather Bergman: -- most tools that you buy in a store don't have a tether point on them.  Host: What?  Heather Bergman: Yeah [laughter]. So we want to make sure none of that hardware floats away if the crew member lets go of it. So at a bare minimum, we almost always have to add a tether point.  Host: In working through that process, does -- it strikes me that that's something that sounds like it's got all sorts of opportunities for you to be frustrated, in trying to get this to work. I mean, it -- because you're trying to figure out something really difficult, and then you've got -- not difficult? You're shaking your head.  Drew Hood: No, it is difficult. I would say the frustration is usually on the back end, trying to get all the paperwork in order. Like, solving the problem up front is the fun, exciting part. Like, that's the blast, and then checking all the boxes, dotting your T's, crossing all your I's -- oh, other way around, yeah. You know what I meant [laughter]. That's -- like, see, that's the challenging part, the paperwork.  Host: Already -- it occurs to me to ask that, in the course of doing this, that it might be helpful for you to not only be working with all the other engineers that you know who have developed tools for other missions, but to talk to astronauts who have used the actual tools in actual space to do this stuff. Did you have a lot of access, a lot of help from the astronaut office in working through this stuff?  Heather Bergman: Absolutely. This -- especially with this -- not with every EVA, we don't necessarily have a lot of access to the astronauts, but with this one in particular, we knew from the beginning that this was going to be a challenging set of EVAs. And we were going to need to design the tools to be used by probably a more particular crew than usual. A lot of our hardware is designed to be built by any crew member, on any day, and the crew members are all very capable of using them. But this was such a difficult repair idea that we thought it was going to be intricate and difficult enough that we were probably going to have to have somebody that trained on it, more like on a Hubble mission, where they'd seen the hardware and played with the hardware in the worksite on more than one occasion. Because it was just going to be too much to do based on reading through the procedures, and too much to pick up and just -- just real quick.  Host: We hear astronauts talk about how they receive skills training when they're getting ready for an International Space Station mission, because they don't know what spacewalk they're going to do, if any, but they know how to do the skills things. But what I understand you saying is that this was different. There was a very specific set of skills that were going to be needed here that weren't needed in other -- for other tasks, in other spacewalks.  Heather Bergman: Yeah, well, we tried to go find tools from industry to be able to use. We weren't successful in most cases, so most things had to be built from the ground up. And there are nuances of how you use them. There are very particular things that you have to know, to do step A before you do B, and it took a lot of training for the crew that's up there right now to be able to use those -- I think anybody could use them, but to try and use them efficiently, so that we can get through a very long series of EVAs in as short a time as possible. It took them a lot of time to get used to using the hardware.  Host: Justin, you looked like you were about to join in.  Justin Cassidy: Heather's words were, of course, fantastic, spot-on [laughter].  Host: She seems to agree.  Justin Cassidy: Yeah, I think so [laughter]. I think so. It is very -- the requirement for the training for the crew members that were going -- brought to us to evaluate and test our tools before the final flight crew was selected -- they were definitely very seasoned veterans of astronauts, and they've used tools before. And they know how to use them, generic skill training. Some of the tools that we used during the repair are pretty generic tools. There are screwdrivers. They're pretty easy to operate. But when you combine that with all the worksite factors that you're dealing with, having a specialized knowledge of how that tool works, what to go, what to count, how hard to turn, where your body position -- really did require the specialized training at the NBL [Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory] in our Argos [Active Response Gravity Offload System] facilities in order to accommodate and create that comfort level for them to work proficiently, if that makes sense.  Host: Yeah. In listening to a previous podcast where we talked with the folks who helped develop the timelines for these repairs, I got the sense that, in the process of working all of this out, you found out some things about the spacewalking suits that astronauts use on the International Space Station. That may -- I don't know if it was that you didn't know before, or just that worked into what you were doing here. What -- tell me about what those things were.  Heather Bergman: I thought that this was cemented what we knew about the suit. I mean, it's a spacecraft all in itself. It's an amazing piece of hardware, but it has its limitations. There are reach limitations for how far you can go into something. It's very bulky and large, and we're going into a small cavity. So there are definitely some reach limitations, and I don't know that those were surprising to us. But I feel like I'm more surprised at how much we're able to do -- not that we're limited, but there are things that we can do that I'm almost surprised that we can do. Because normally, we would've -- I would've thought we couldn't get into an area like this.   Host: But you found that, in fact, you -- how big an area are we talking about that you mentioned? I mean, how big a workspace inside the AMS are these astronauts going to be dealing with? I don't mean an exact number, but --  Heather Bergman: I think it's about 18 inches deep.  Drew Hood: Yeah, it's the shape of Nevada. So if you think of the state of Nevada --  Host: -- I'm sorry, what? It's the shape of Nevada.  Drew Hood: Yeah, it looks like the state of Nevada. That's the shape of it, and I'd say it's probably --  Host: And it's 18 inches deep?  Drew Hood:  18 inches deep.  Justin Cassidy: Drew's doing hand gestures for those who are listening --  Drew Hood: What do you think, three, maybe four feet tall, and three feet wide?  Justin Cassidy: -- maybe a little larger on the wide.  Drew Hood: Maybe a little larger, but yeah.  Justin Cassidy: The VSB [Vertical support beam] tray -- sure.  Drew Hood: Yeah, yeah. So, yeah. Climbing down in that cavity when you're in a giant spacesuit --  Justin Cassidy: And it could be dark.  Drew Hood: -- yeah.  Host: Well, it will be, for at least part of it. Are they going to bring lights?  Justin Cassidy: That's right?  Heather Bergman: They will be bringing lights, but they've also got a tool belt. Their workstation is on the front of them, so that means -- when you're working at home, you just -- you belly right up to the workspace. They can't necessarily do that, because they've got their work belt that's in the way. And so, that leaves them just a little farther out of the worksite, so --  Host: And covers up at least part of the reach of their own arms.  Heather Bergman: -- mm-hmm.  Host: So keeping them from getting that much further inside to the workspace --  Heather Bergman: Yeah, Luca's long arms will come in handy.  Host: Will help.  Justin Cassidy: I mean, we had certain new tools that we provided, but we also leveraged on building tool stack-ups of existing tools that already were in the arsenal of the EVA community. So that enabled us to have a further reach for where they actually can touch.  Host: Give me an example.  Justin Cassidy: We would use a bit that's six inches long, and that was certainly not going to make the reach, so we put a socket extension on there. And now, you've got an 18-inch reach.  Host: So not essentially different than the ratchet set I have at home --  Justin Cassidy: That's correct.  Host: -- But, more expensive [laughter]. But just common sense kind of -- of ways to make existing tools do the work that you need them to do, which is what you guys do all the time anyway, right?  Heather Bergman: Yeah.  Drew Hood: And starting at the beginning -- you asked about kind of like the process we had. So we used these facilities, and a lot of 3D-printed concepts. So we would take a -- go print up an idea of just volumetrically -- here's what we think we want to use. Now, get a crew member into a facility, and see if he can reach in there, and envision himself being in a spacesuit, and saying, \"Oh, yeah, I think I can do this task,\" or, \"Oh, wait, how I do that -- I actually bump up against this. I don't think this tool's going to work in this form factor.\" And so, we went through a lot of iterations of just dummy, solid, 3D-printed shapes to progress to then prototypes that were semi-functional, and then flight-like engineering development units. And that spanned multiple -- a year, year and a half on some of the tools because of their complexities. We want to make sure we got it right at the end, and we spent a lot of time up front.  Host: Is 3D printing things faster and less expensive than developing --  Drew Hood: Very less expensive. So I can 3D print a widget just the size of, like, a water bottle for about 35 to 40 cents of material. Now, granted, there's electricity costs, and the cost of the unit, but --  Host: -- I'll cover the electricity for you, but --  Drew Hood: -- yeah, exactly.  Host: -- I mean -- but assuming you've already bought your 3D -- you already have the 3D printer --  Drew Hood: We have the -- yep.  Host: -- you can knock out a --  Drew Hood: Overnight. We start it when I leave, and it'll be there in the morning when I get back. It literally sits on my desk in the office, so --  Host: -- Drew, you made reference to some facilities that you used. Tell me about the different -- the different stuff here -- the places where astronauts train for spacewalks that you used in the process of developing these tools.  Drew Hood: -- yeah, so one of those is called Argos, stands for the Active Response Gravity Offload System. That's a little bit of a mouthful, but --  Heather Bergman: Which is why we use acronyms, by the way.  Drew Hood: -- yeah [laughter], Argos. So it is a system that incorporates a crane, that crane that basically -- you attach it to a crew member, and say you weigh 200 pounds, and you want to make it feel like you weigh 100. This crane will offload 100 pounds, and it sits there and senses with a load cell. If you jump, it realizes, oh, wow, I'm only offloading 80 pounds. Now I better pick the guy up, so it lifts you up. And then, as you start to fall, it says, \"Oh, man, this guy's weighing 120 pounds. I better let him down.\" And it does this real-time, very rapidly, and so it also moves in the horizontal plane, the X-Y direction. And it has a little sensor that measures the angle of that cable that you're being suspended from. So you can walk around, and jump in parabolas just like you're in any gravity environment, whether that's micro-gravity, or lunar gravity, or Martian gravity. We can simulate all of those in a mechanical crane-like system.  Host: You're still attached to this crane, so you can't fly, but you can float-ish.  Drew Hood: Float, yep. It doesn't do your appendages very well. So, like, your arm still feels like you're in 1G. Your legs still feel like you're in 1G, so we have to do some things to help with those artifacts. But, we actually lay the mockup down on its back, and the crew member can actually fly over in a spacesuit, and be floating around like he would be in micro-gravity.  Host: And in this 1G environment, it sounds like they're floating above it.  Drew Hood: They're floating above it, and he's horizontal. And he can work down in the cavity, and we actually have a foot restraint, like I mentioned earlier, that we can roll in. It's like on a little crane arm, and it's not robotic. We can't position it with, like, a robot, but we can roll it around and lock it in place. And we can do the best job we can to simulate where he would actually be at in real life, on the space station. The second place is the NBL, the Neutral Buoyancy Lab. So that one was where we have a full-size mockup of the International Space Station submerged underwater. And so, that mockup is a little bit simplified, because it's made out of stainless steel and some plastic. We don't have all the intricate details on that mockup, because it has to live in the water environment. But it gives them another layer of training. So we use both of those in tandem.   Host: And does that mean that you -- when you're developing tools, you have to develop them not only -- or some version of it, ultimately, will have to be able to work where there's no oxygen, but the training method has to be able to work underwater, has to be able to get wet.  Drew Hood: It does, and we do some work -- the biggest thing there is to actually make it feel neutrally buoyant. So sometimes, we have to swap things out so they don't float or sink. So, like, if I take my --  Host: Balsa-wood screwdriver, or --  Drew Hood: -- exactly. Actually, there's some pretty great plastics, though, that you can -- like, say if you just had a simple knob that it's not going to take a bunch of load. I'm going to use aluminum for my flight, you know, but aluminum sinks really well in water. So I need to swap it out for a plastic that's neutrally buoyant, so I'll make some changes, and try to make that tool float -- well, be neutrally buoyant as close as possible. Because you don't want that -- a boat anchor. That's not positive to training.  Host: So then it -- for the astronaut who's training, it feels like it would feel when they are --  Drew Hood: Correct.  Host: -- were on orbit.  Heather Bergman: And that can be challenging, when you get heavier hardware that is required to be tough enough -- when you get handrails, and some of our other hardware that it really needs to be able to take load, and plastics don't tend to do that very well. So sometimes, we'll do what Drew calls arts and crafts, where we'll try to attach little plastic or foam to areas that they don't have to touch, that'll help make it a little lighter, so that it'll float a little more.  Host: Just -- and again, get weight of it in other ways that are not --  Drew Hood: Yep.  Host: -- that don't impact its use.  Heather Bergman: And every once in a while, we take too much weight off, and it floats to the surface.  Host: Away --  Heather Bergman: And we have to pull it out of the pool skimmer, but [laughter] --  Drew Hood: Or sometimes we'll actually build a whole separate tool. Like I mentioned 3D printing -- we'll 3D-print a volumetric one that they can take out in a bag, and they can go through the tasks of tethering it, and handing it off to each other, and getting set up in the worksite. And then, we do what's called the magic swap. A support diver comes up and gives them the heavy one, and takes away the lightweight one, and they do their task. And then the diver comes back and gives them the lightweight one, nonfunctional one, and they can proceed with stowing it again.  Host: -- that they swapped out.  Drew Hood: And so, we do that a lot in training as well.  Host: A hundred years ago, I used to dive at the NBL running cameras, and would watch that happen all the time, where, you know, they would take out a plastic thing, and practice maneuvering it around, and getting it where they needed to be. And then a diver would come up, take it away, and give them a machine that would allow them to actually turn a bolt in a thing.  Drew Hood: -- yeah.  Drew Hood: And the great thing -- now we can just 3D-print them, and so, they're pretty cheap now. And I just start them before I go home, and they're ready to go the next morning. And if they break, I print another one.  Host: Let's get to some examples of tools. I think they said there were 20-something new -- brand-new tools, and I don't know that you need to tell me all 20. But give me some examples of these brand-new tools that are, or are about to, be on board the International Space Station so that these astronauts will have them to use to keep AMS running well. Want to start, Justin?  Justin Cassidy: So the tools that we altered from -- as a Hubble tool are specialized in that they -- our task that -- that JSC has, has asked us to participate for this repair was to help take apart things. Take apart things are actually fun and easy. It's putting them back together, or actually even better putting things back together -- the tools are not necessarily specialized. And what they need to do, basically, is to remove a screw, and allow you to then remove a cover. It's how we remove it, and how we control that screw that potentially could become loose, and this screw has a washer as well. So we want to minimize losing that screw and washer in a space environment, because it could be detrimental to ISS. If one gets away, that is acceptable, but our going-in plan is, we want to capture all hardware, control it, and put it away.  Host: I mean, in those cases, don't you need it to put the thing back together again, too?  Justin Cassidy: We have a very fortunate path forward that they are not required to put this cover back on. We are being -- closing out that worksite with a tent, basically, an MLI [Multilayer insulation] tent.  Host: I don't want to distract. Go ahead. You're talking about developing the tool.  Justin Cassidy: So, yeah -- so developing the tool -- basically, these are screws. They're called socketed cap screws. They are number 10 in size. They are about an inch long in thread, and they are OK and easy to remove. But again, what we bring from our investment in working with Hubble, and its repair, and controlling foreign object debris, screws and washers becoming loose -- because Hubble was an optical instrument, while astronauts were working inside of Hubble, you didn't want one of these washers or screws getting in the optical path, hence compromising the science.  Host: Right.  Justin Cassidy: So we're going in with the same kind of plan, because we want to control these screws. So we have tools that we have brought, and provide to the astronauts for releasing screws, and capturing them, and putting them away in an appropriate way that saves them from becoming FOD.  Host: Cool. Give me another example. Give me another new tool.  Heather Bergman: So one of my favorites is the new zip-tie cutter. We -- Justin was talking about not wanting foreign object debris, FOD, floating around. You don't want to let anything get loose. You don't want it to -- space station's moving 17,500 miles an hour. If that comes back around and hits you, that's going to sting. So even something like a plastic zip-tie is not something we want to let go. So there are a lot of zip-ties. They bundled all this up real nice before they launched it, and now we need to go break into all of it. So we need to pull all those out. So you could use scissors, or any number of EVA tools that we have now.  Host: I was thinking that doesn't sound like a -- like it would be too complicated a tool.  Heather Bergman: Yeah, you could, but they're really tight, and so, it's -- because sometimes, it's hard to get the scissors in there. And again, we're 18 inches down in there, and so you can't necessarily get in there. So this tool -- we actually work with a group called Micro G Next here, where they go out, and they present challenges to the college students in the country, and say, \"Hey, we've got a problem. We'd like to see -- get your take on this problem.\" And so, they bring forward proposals, and they get to design their tools, and bring them out here, and test them in the NBL. And our group reads those proposals, and helps those students out a lot, and one of them -- the proposals -- maybe -- I think it was one last year was a zip-tie cutter. And one of the teams brought that forward, and we took it over to show one of the astronauts. And he was like, \"Oh, this thing's amazing. We need to fly this.\"  Host: We need what?  Heather Bergman: We need to fly this. This needs to be on AMS. It needs to happen, and we were like, I -- you mean AMS, the hardware we're delivering here in just a few months, that AMS? Yeah, that one. So our team took what the students had done, and we modified that tool to be more flight -- to follow the flight requirements that we had, to make sure it was going to meet the load requirements, and all the safety requirements. We modified that, and so that'll be flying here shortly. So it cuts the zip-tie. There's a little tiny foot on it that'll slide underneath a zip-tie, and -- almost regardless of how tight it is, and then you push a button, and it'll cut the zip-tie, but it'll also -- when you cut it, a little foot comes down and grabs the zip-tie, and holds onto it. And then you can move the cutter over into the trash can, and -- or their little trash bag, and when you hit a different button, it'll let the zip-tie loose, and release it into the trash.  Host: So it's holding onto it, so that nothing floats away.  Heather Bergman: Yep.  Drew Hood: Another big concern is, these tight zip-ties are wrapped around a ribbon cable that is kind of like a spinal cord of data for AMS. So if you just go out there willy-nilly with your scissors and start hacking at it, you could end the EVAs really quickly if you damage that cable.  Host: You want to cut zip-ties and only zip-ties.  Drew Hood: Yeah, only zip-ties, so yeah, we had to -- the cool features of that zip-tie cutter is that it has that foot that slips underneath that zip-tie, and protects that ribbon cable.  Host: What other are -- new tools can we look forward to seeing being used?  Drew Hood: I really like the clean-cutter. We kind of talked about that earlier, that it's kind of a combination of various features you find in the industry. So if you ever just cut a tube, whether it's PVC, [Polyvinyl chloride] or a piece of copper, or a stainless-steel tube -- a brake line, you usually have a tool where you make one revolution, you tighten it, you make one revolution, you tighten it, and you go through that process until you finally get through your tube. And then usually, the tube's then scrunched down. You might have to ream it out, or clean it up for you to connect. And so, that process -- we wanted to simplify that for the crew member. And so, there were some tools in industry that ratchet, that you only tighten it down once, and then the head spins. And there were different styles of that, so we ended up tailoring what we found in industry to cut a four-millimeter line specifically. So you wouldn't just go sell this on a shelf, because there's only one specific line diameter with one specific wall thickness that this tube cutter works with, but it does it repeatedly, every single time, leaving behind a clean, round tube that is ready for the connection for the repair. And so, that was one of my favorite things of picking things out from industry, and then repackaging it to solve this very unique problem.  Host: And in this case, these tubes that you're cutting, if I understand right, is to allow you to remove the old pump or pumps --  Drew Hood: Yep.  Host: -- which are then going to be replaced with new hardware, but somehow have to be reconnected to those same lines that you just cut.  Drew Hood: Yeah. Yep. I kind of like to think of this whole thing as kind of like -- my biomedical side comes out a little bit, and it's kind of like you're working on a patient here. So we have to get behind the rib cage. We're going to do a heart transplant, really. So Justin has designed tools to remove that debris shield. That's opening up the rib cage.  Host: Rib cutters.  Drew Hood: Yep, rib cutters. Take off the rib cage. Now, we're going to get down -- we have that -- we have that spinal cord there that we need to move out of the way, that data cable, so we use a zip-tie cutter, and we move that out of the way. And then we have these eight stainless-steel tubes that are kind of like the veins and arteries, because some of the supply lines going to out to the radiators, and some of the return lines. So we have to cut into those, but we have to cut into them and remember which ones they are. Because if you mix up your arteries and your veins, that's a bad day.  Host: Yeah.  Drew Hood: And so --  Host: Are they all the same size?  Drew Hood: -- they're all the same size, all the same color, yep, yep, yep. So when we cut them, we actually have to label them. So we have a little tool that --  Host: That's what I was thinking. Like, you know, Post-It notes of different colors.  Drew Hood: -- kind of like -- kind of like Post-It notes, but our Post-It notes -- you cut them, and you bend them up towards you, and you put this little cap on. It's kind of like a finger trap, where you can snap it on, but you can't pull it off. So as they cut one, they label it. They cut one, they label it. Then you end up with all these tubes sticking up out of the worksite with the labels on the end. So now, you have to come back and clean cut it with the clean-cutter I just described to prep that tube, so you can connect it. So once we do that, you hang the new heart on the outside of the box. There's this pump box that you -- that we bring up. This is the repair box. So that's the new heart, with the new CO2 gas, the new blood, the new lifeblood for the vehicle, for AMS. So now, you have to connect those veins, as you were just mentioning. So we go through and use a special swage fitting to actually reconnect those veins to -- and then you have to open up the new heart, get the blood flowing, and then close everything back up. So it's kind of like a -- kind of like a patient repair.  Host: Little surgery --  Heather Bergman: That's a good analogy.  Host: -- yeah.  Drew Hood: It is, yeah.  Host: Tell me about more tools. What other things did you guys help create that are going to get pressed into use here?  Drew Hood: One of the simplest ones I kind of like is just the puller. So the puller, as I mentioned --  Host: A puller, Gracie?   Drew Hood: -- yeah [laughter], a brake puller, actually.  Heather Bergman: It was designed off a brake puller.  Drew Hood: Off a brake puller -- so we just needed a way -- we talked about that reach. We're 18 inches down in this cavity. They're trying to reach down for these stainless-steel tubes and pull them up to their -- to them -- to the worksite, and they're very close together. And so, we looked through, and someone said, \"Hey, what about a brake puller?\" We literally brought in a brake puller from Ace, or Home Depot, or somewhere, and had them try it out. And they're like, oh, this actually works pretty good. So we had to flight-ify, and change materials, but it's literally a metal hook with a bend on the end. And it's simple, but it does the job.  Host: And it's easier to make something simple than it is to make something complicated.  Drew Hood: Yep.  Host: Others? Other tools that are your favorites?  Heather Bergman: Favorites? No, we have more least-favorites. [Laughter]  Host: We love all of our tools equally?  Heather Bergman: No, not even a little. [Laughter]  Justin Cassidy: I could probably give you an example.  Host: Yes, Justin?  Justin Cassidy: So we have something called a capture cage that we developed, and I'm sorry, again -- go back to Hubble, but we --  Host: Don't apologize.  Justin Cassidy: -- had something called a --  Host: Did good work.  Justin Cassidy: -- a fastener capture plate. So we had a repair on Hubble, and it had over 100 screws on it. And we didn't want to risk losing these 100 screws, so what we basically did is put a large cover on top of these, and release the little screws. And they would float around in these little pockets, so we called it the fastener capture plate. So you release it. The screw would float around this little pocket, but it could not get out. Yet how you release it was a bit that went through a little hole, so the bit can go in, but the screw cannot go out the hole. And then we'd removed that entire thing. So what we did for AMS is, we have three difficult screws in the IPA [Interface panel A] area, which is a three -- area designated for three fasteners that we need to remove. We made little, tiny fastener capture plates, basically a five-sided box. When you install it, when you install it against the cover that becomes your sixth side. So it's then trapped box. A screwdriver would reach in there, release the screw, and both the washer and the screw would float around in the cage, and then you would remove the cover.  Host: Wow. Nice.  Heather Bergman: I think I have one more. So the -- we have a tool board. So when you -- when you're doing a repair at your house, you have a bunch of tools. You set them down next to you. Well, we can't set anything down next to us. We've got a second crew member who will be helping hand things back and forth, but he's only got so many hands as well. So one of the things we made was a tool board. It's -- think of it as the pegboard in your garage. It's got places for them to take some of the tools that they use regularly and put it on the board, and take out something new, and then, when they're done with that one, they can put it back. So it holds four or five different tools, so they can go back and forth regularly without having to dig through a bag, and untangle things in the bag.  Host: And presumably, the things that they are using most frequently at any particular point, so that they're handy.  Heather Bergman: Correct.  Host: You -- and is this the tool suite that you mentioned in the note that you sent me before we got here?  Heather Bergman: Yeah. So everything together becomes this new AMS tool suite. This is such a specialized set of repairs that most of this hardware won't be able to be used for other tasks. We're already looking -- the zip-tie cutter -- we're actually working right now to close up a certification to allow that to stay on space station and be used on other spacewalks, but this tool board is specifically holding a four-millimeter clean-cutter. And there's just not that many four-millimeter lines on station. So most of the rest of this hardware won't be able to necessarily be used in its current format for other spacewalks, so this suite is really special to AMS. And it's there just for this particular task.  Host: In developing these special tools for this particular task, as we've said, you got some inspiration, if not some more practical guidance, from developing the tools to repair the Hubble Space Telescope -- not only to make repairs, but also to change out some of its instruments, things that were intended to do. Justin, you did the work on Hubble, and developing tools. How did this compare?   Justin Cassidy: Some of the -- well, when we replaced large-box instruments on Hubble, their major interface was a 7/16ths double hexagon bolt. I mean, it was very simple, so that's a very standard large power tool with a socket extension, with a 7/16ths socket at the end. And you drive a bolt, you release the instrument, and the astronaut would remove it and put a new one in. So that's pretty straightforward, and this is definitely what is still maintained up to ISS today, is using that type of interface. Our last servicing mission is where -- I mentioned before is when we actually started performing mini or microsurgery, replacing circuit cards. That involved turning the astronaut into basically a ground technician, removing covers, and getting to the circuit board, and replace those, and everything is sharp all over the place. So those became quite challenging tasks in themselves in aspects of sharp edges, creating FOD, ESD concerns generated during the repair, and then, as difficult as that was, it is fun and easy and takes a long time to remove and get down to where you need to take the repair. But putting it back together actually is the easier part, because it's easy. And, for example, when we took apart one of the instruments on Hubble called the STIS, we took the radio cover off, took over an hour to get that cover off. When it came to -- after the new board was put into it, the new cover went on in less than five minutes. It simply went on, two latches were thrown, and it was done.  Host: Didn't have to redo each of the little screws.  Justin Cassidy: We did not. So the major reason for that is, everything that we build on the ground is going to be launched into space. So it needs to survive the launch environment. So it's vibrated very heavily during launch, and we do testing on the ground to make sure that things are going to survive launch. But now we're doing -- we're pairing space. So, don't necessarily have to put 100 screws back in. You may only have to put a fraction of that in because there are no large un-orbit lows that can be put into that box.  Host: They're not going to have to go through that same sort of --  Justin Cassidy: Exactly, exactly. So, you're really trying to replace a carbon that this case is restoring the thermal path in order -- because this is a raider that we're removing. Restore that thermal path, you need a lot of screws, two latches, and we're done.  Host: As a public service, we'll put STIS in the transcript. It's Space Telescope --  Justin Cassidy: Imaging Spectrograph.  Host: OK. Well, I won't have to. And FOD is, Foreign Object Debris?  Justin Cassidy: Yes.  Heather Bergman: Things that are floating around.  Host: Heather you said earlier that you had worked in -- in shuttle times. Makes it sound like that's 100 years ago. [Laughter]   Heather Bergman: At least it feels like it.  Host: Developing tools. And I think that was for the -- the tile repairs that we had to do after the loss of Columbia. They were being developed to figure out how to make those kind of repairs in the future if it -- if it came to that point again. Did that work compare to what you were doing here?  Heather Bergman: In that they're very challenging and it's a very specialized set of tools. We weren't just going to find something on the shelf that could fix that. We were repairing both the -- the RCC [Reinforced carbon-carbon], the leading edge of the wing where Columbia's main damage was, and -- and the tiles themselves. You're in a very challenging workspace. For the shuttle -- you weren't allowed to touch anything, because while you were trying to repair this damage, you didn't want to do damage to anything else. You were trying to, you know, stay back away. You didn't have any handrails. So very similar from that perspective. We -- we still -- this workspace is -- wasn't meant to be a workspace. Once we take this debris shield off, there are lots of areas behind the debris shield that were not tested to make sure they were not sharp. We want -- we're very careful to make sure that we're not going to do anything to cut the gloves of the spacesuit or any other part of the spacesuit.  Host: Right.  Heather Bergman: So, before we button any piece of hardware up, before we launch it, we test it to make sure there are no sharp edges and if there are, we file those down, make them safe. Well, once we pull this cover off, everything behind that, hasn't been tested for that. So, we've done a lot of work to find out where we might still have some areas that might be sharp. So, those do exist back there and it's one of the reasons why we want this crew to be very trained so that they are careful and are aware of where those sharp edges are without us having to constantly remind them, hey, don't touch that, don't touch that, don't touch that.  Host: Right.  Heather Bergman: So, they can't touch much while they're in there either. They don't have any handrails. Neither of those tasks were trivial and you -- people are very passionate about both tasks for different reasons. So, you get into strong personalities and --  Host: Oh really?  Heather Bergman: And difficult -- some difficult conversations as you try to weigh the options out and make sure everybody's getting what they want while everybody's still being safe.  Host: Yeah. Drew did you have experience before working on AMS tools that -- that helped you in doing this task?  Drew Hood: Yeah, I did. I would say this was obviously a very new challenge for me. As I mentioned earlier, I kind of spent a lot of time in the development world where it’s kind of the quick and easy solutions we look for. We are trying to make trainers on a shoestring budget do some tasks with crew members for future missions, like looking way in the future. So, it was really neat to kind of bring that mindset of the quick and easy solution to this really complicated challenge and say, what about this? Why does it need to be that complicated? So, we really need to do that? And I really enjoyed that of trying to look at it kind of from a different perspective of coming with very little knowledge and actually having the opportunity to -- a chance to speak up about that stuff. Instead of just kind of learning the old way, it was hey, we have this problem. Let's see how we can solve it a different way. And coming together and finding the middle ground.  Host: Not just because it's the way we're always done it.  Drew Hood: Yep.  Host: That Sort of thing. You've developed all these great tools. Did you have any problems in getting them to the worksite? Getting them to space.  Heather Bergman: Well, we've -- we -- some of the hardware is rather large. I mean the new box that they're launching is 400 pounds. So that -- I think that can fit in one vehicle that we have right now.  Host: Yeah.  Heather Bergman: Some of our handrails are rather large. So -- and we also wanted to get most of these up in fairly short period of time, prior to the EVAs. Because we don't want them sitting on station taking up space for a year prior to -- space there is -- is –pretty important.   Host: Because you had it all ready to go a year ago?  Heather Bergman: No, not even a little. [Laughter] But as we get closer to the date that we have the crew that we want ready to go, we definitely had to look -- we had to talk with our logistics people who were in charge of weighing what goes up, and what doesn't, and making sure that we had the hardware ready on the day they needed it. Because most the time it was a bit of a challenge to get it ready by that day. To get it up on this specific vehicle. Because there wasn't necessarily going to be a second shot to get it up there.  Host: Right.  Heather Bergman: And still have the trained crew use it.  Drew Hood: You know, and I think for those that keep a close eye on space launches, some of our hardware was on HTV [H-II Transfer Vehicle], that had a little bit of a launchpad fire and a delay, so some of our hardware was on there and we had a few nail bitters of -- when that got delayed of when that was going to launch, but thankfully it successfully made it to the station and delivered I think nearly the last. We've got one more launch.  Heather Bergman: One more.  Drew Hood: One more launch.  Heather Bergman: And NG-12 should be the last of the hardware.  Host: Right. I am looking forward a lot to seeing these spacewalks and see how all your work turns out.  Heather Bergman: And I'd be -- I'd be remiss if I didn't say, it's not just the three of us working on this by any means. There is a small army behind us that is --  Host: And behind them there's a bigger army.  Heather Bergman: Exactly, so that is -- you know, we're the people that kind of get to go talk to people about what the team has done, but we're by no means the only people doing work on this side. It's been -- it's been a huge effort across agencies. Within the NASA agency to Goddard, and a number of other places. So, it's --  Justin Cassidy: Pat, I want to mention Drew touched on the two training facilities, the ARGOS and the NBL.  Host: Right.  Justin Cassidy: So, these are fantastic assets that we leverage on in order to train crew. I'd also like to say it also – is a tremendous [tool] that it also trains us as well. So, both at Argos, all three of us participated in that, and for divers, Heather and I both dived in the NBL. So we have spent tens -- of hours watching different crews do the repair, such that I feel very prepared that when the mission is being conducted, and we have camera view of what they're doing, we know where they are, we know -- we've seen this and we know if something's going off nominal, and how to respond to that with the team.  Heather Bergman: Yeah, and we're actually right now, while we lead up to these EVAs, which will hopefully happen here shortly, we're doing simulations of those EVAs. So if somebody has gone through and planned out the EVA and they throw little snafus in there for us and we have to figure out what we can do, what we can do real-time to get the crew to get back on track and make sure that they're safe, but that we still maintain the EVA if at all possible.  Host: Sim Sup my old friend. [Laughter]  Heather Bergman: Yes, so we've been running through sims and we'll say, enjoying that.  Host: Great. Heather Bergman, Justin Cassidy, Drew Hood, thank you very much for sharing the story. Look forward to seeing it all go well.  Host: Thank you.  Drew Hood: Thank you.  Justin Cassidy: Thank you for having us.  [ Music ]  Host: At last report there would be four spacewalks done to complete the repairs to the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. First, to remove shields to gain access to the worksite. A second to cut stainless steel tubing to remove old pumps and then put the AMS on temporary life support until the third spacewalk, which will be to install the system of new pumps and connect that tubing. And then fourth, to verify that there aren't any leaks at the installation site. Make any repairs if they're needed. And then reinstall the shielding and the insulation to get AMS back to the business of searching for evidence of the origins of the universe. You'll be able to follow along with all of the spacewalks on NASA TV and online at NASA.gov. Also, there's a very interesting story about the history of the development and the deployment of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. We didn't even begin to get into that in these episodes. But you can. The story is called “AMS: The Fight for Flight.” You can access it on NASA.gov and other online sites. I'll remind you that you can go online to keep up with all things NASA at NASA.gov.

        description: "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 170, \"Live Like a Martian.\" I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. We are continuing our “Mars Monthly” series on first Fridays. Last month, we chatted with Dr. Grace Douglas to discuss how we might address food and nutrition, not only on our way to the red planet but once we get there. And how we're going to have meal storage and prep and maybe even grow our own food, all on the table, pun intended. While planning for this kind of trip. Which leads us into our episode this month. If you think about it, a multi-year journey to and from Mars, as we are discovering in this series, will differ quite a bit from our trips to low-Earth orbit. But the same human needs apply for a crew headed to the surface of Mars. Transportation, supplies, sleep, food, staying mentally and physically healthy, like connecting with family and friends and getting exercise among other things. We have learned a lot to prepare us for living on Mars. From research on Earth and on long duration missions aboard the International Space Station. And we continue to learn how to keep our spacefarers safe and health every day. As humans explore further from Earth, medical systems and counter measures and planning for the overall health and wellness of our brave explorers headed to and living on Mars are some major topics. Dr. Sharmila Watkins, medical officer in the Human Health and Performance Directorate, Dr. Jennifer Fogarty, chief scientist of the Human Research Program, and NASA astronaut and medical doctor Serena Aunon-Chancellor are tackling this topic here at NASA Johnson Space Center. So here we go. How humans from Earth will live like Martians with Sharmi, Jenn, and Serena. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Sharmi, Jenn, and Serena, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today. What a wonderful trio of guests that we have to tackle this topic. I think it's one of the more exciting in our series of this Mars Monthly series that we're doing, “Living Like a Martian.” And who better to talk about living like a Martian than folks who are so engrained in some of the exploration research here and know more about the human body and how -- what happens to it in space than a lot of other people. So, I'm very happy to have you on. We have three very special guests. So, we're going to go through each of your backgrounds. It seems like, just talking to you a little bit beforehand, you've all known each other a long time, you all have very similar backgrounds. So, having your perspective and your joint knowledge is going to be very interesting. Sharmi Watkins, let's start with a little bit about yourself.  Sharmi Watkins: Sure. Thanks for having us. So, I have known I was interested in space medicine since I was about 15 years old. I grew up watching my dad, who is a family physician, and my uncle, who's an aerospace engineer, and I was interested in aspects of both of their jobs. And then in high school, I found out that there was this career path that was the intersection of aerospace engineering and medicine. And I knew that was the path for me. And so, from there, I went on to get my bachelor’s degree in aeronautical engineering from MIT. From there, I got my Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Texas medical branch and my Master of Public Health degree. And then like Serena, I did residencies in combined aerospace and internal medicine. So, after residency, I was hired by NASA as a contractor. And I started in the exploration medical capability element of the Human Research Program working with Jenn. And what we did there was plan for exploration missions developing the medical capabilities that we'll need to be successful on those missions. I did that for about five years and then I decided I wanted to be an operational flight surgeon. And so, I trained to become an ISS certified surgeon. I worked with the Human Research Program for a few years as their program clinician. And then later, I worked with SpaceX as a Subject Matter Expert. And then I started working within the Human Health and Performance Directorate as the lead integrator for exploration activities. But the most exciting job I had lately is I was the surgeon for Christina Koch's 11-month mission to the ISS, which she launched in March of 2019 and she returned in February of this year. And since she's been back, I have been back in my job doing integration for the Human Health and Performance Directorate, as it regards all of our exploration activities from the Moon to Mars.  Host: How about that? And we're already alluding to the fact, how intertwined, and how you're all in the same circles. This is wonderful. And it seems like you spent a lot of time at NASA and your career was sort of the foundation of it was you already had an idea that this was something you were passionate about. And just from some of the things you talked about, your career and what you've done and what you've been a part of, it seems like there's really no way to get bored. It seems like, you know, you wanted to do something, you were passionate about it, and look at your career so far. You're exploring all of these different pathways and angles on how to look at what happens to human bodies in space. Why do you love it so much?  Sharmi Watkins: I think for exactly the reason you just said. There is never a dull day, there is no way to get bored with the job that I have. I am able to explore different programs within NASA's wide array of programs. So, I've had the fortune of supporting the International Space Station, I've gotten to see Soyuz launches, I've gotten to play with design and development with my colleagues at SpaceX testing the boundaries on what we can do with new vehicles. And now of course, we're looking forward to the Moon and Mars. So never a dull day, always something engaging to do.  Host: Wonderful and welcome to Houston We Have a Podcast. I'm glad we can have you on.  Sharmi Watkins: Thank you.  Host: Jenn Fogarty, welcome back. We last chatted when we started the series we did on the Human Research Program.  Jenn Fogarty: Yes, it was a great experience, I've really enjoyed the podcast and we're back for more. Yeah, so I have a PhD in medical physiology. I trained in cardiovascular disease. Trying to understand how the human body both manifests disease and can overcome it, interestingly enough. And we can. And so, I've always been fascinated with the capability of the human body to adapt and overcome a lot of challenges and obstacles and understand how do you give the body the right resources. I followed a little bit of a circuitous path from bachelor’s degree in New Jersey at a small state school to PhD from Texas A&M at the medical college, really fascinated with extreme environments and human physiology, where I was doing the cardiovascular work, because I always incorporated exercise and challenging the body with different stimuli to see what you could induce it to do. And along came an opportunity to work on a NASA grant. And I became familiar with Human Health and Performance at NASA. And really started to see a path forward. So, I came to work at Johnson Space Center, was given some pretty exciting opportunities to see, as Sharmi said, like the intersection of disciplines. And applying skill sets, very unique in various ways. So was able to work both in the Human Research Program along the way and in space medicine. And kind of bridge the gap between medicine and research. Being a PhD, I didn't, you know, dive into becoming a flight surgeon as much as I might have wanted to and admire those folks. But I was able to help understand what the research side needed to do to enable spaceflight and maybe where the challenges were that we were seeing. And then also working with the flight surgeon community to translate what that research meant. How do you interpret it and how do you apply it? And work with counter measures. So, I've played various different roles in the larger organization. And then I came back to the Human Research Program and became the deputy chief scientist. And along the way, the opportunity came up to become the chief scientist. Then it was a challenge I really relish. And it is quite humbling to receive such a large and diverse portfolio of work that's trying to enable human space exploration. And a lot of the challenges we're trying to understand don't even exist yet. We haven't even experienced them. And we don't want the humans who are going to go on that first exploration mission to be the ones to experience it for the first time, right? We want to be able to simulate and to enable the concept of having confidence that we know how to mitigate risk. And Sharmi brought up a really important point, which was prevention. How do we engineer things out, how do we engineer out exposures or vulnerabilities, even at the physiological level? And so a lot of our work goes all the way down into very fundamental mechanistic understanding or all the way up to apply things such as how do we generate load on a, on the musculoskeletal system to keep it in shape, so when people land on Mars, they're capable of getting out of that vehicle and doing their jobs? So, it's really, it runs the gamut. It is applied research program and it's full of a variety of challenges every day that keep us on our toes for sure.  Host: Yeah, and it seems like another one of those roles that you're just never bored in. And your path has taken you through more research. And it makes me think in the research, you know, there's a lot I think that we've uncovered about how the human body reacts, whether it's through the research on the International Space Station or through ground analogous. But Jenn, what are some of those -- what are some of those driving questions for really getting us to a point where we can start applying some knowledge for learning how to -- how to live on Mars? What are some of those driving questions that you and your group are trying to research?  Jenn Fogarty: Yeah, so what we do is take the overarching mission destination, the overall goal, and break it up, kind of decompose it into the various elements of the mission. Because a lot of the challenges that the human body faces has to do with the transition between Earth's gravity, a time period of microgravity, exposure to partial gravity on the surface, and then a return state in microgravity. While the body's really good at adapting, it doesn't necessarily -- it's not necessarily able to accommodate adapting super quickly on the order of hours when we move someone, you know, from a launch perspective from 1 g on Earth to microgravity. So what we try to understand and have tried to mitigate from the risks, go all the way from cardiovascular health and how the body responds and how the heart's able to function and pump blood to all the organs that need it, and then also moving fluid through your vascular system to make sure that you know, it's not causing too much of a pressure change in a certain area, we study a lot about the brain and the eye right now, because we do see some pretty unique changes there. And we're trying to understand what they might mean in the long-term for crew members both during a mission and later on in life. But there's also -- in all aspects of the mission, there's a performance expectation. Not only do these people have to stay healthy to do the mission, but there's a level of physicality to it. And a level of cognitive demand. And when your body is being taxed in a variety of different ways, sometimes those systems may not function at a level that you would anticipate. Like even in everyday life, and I think you and I have talked about this during the last podcast. You know, the concept of well if I don't get a good night's sleep and I'm dehydrated, how well do I perform the next day? Well the same could be said for crew members on orbit, but then they also have all those additional stressors of being in microgravity, which is a very unique experience for a body that's been evolved to live in 1 g. You know, and all of our body systems are regulated based on kind of that sensory system that says OK, I know what the push and pull of gravity is and I know how to manage it. Well suddenly, you no longer have that. It's just a unique environment. And a lot of what we've done over the years is not to say that it's all negative, but it is change. And then you're trying to understand how does the evidence based around measuring that change indicate will we have a good outcome? Meaning will the crew member we provide adequate rest, nutrition, hydration, and exercise, you know, be able to function at the level the mission requires? The other element is really about the psychological element. Where you're trying to understand when people are taken out of their normal everyday lives, which is not abnormal for crew members, it's what they train on, but then put in very stressful circumstances and then are incredibly isolated. How does that weigh on them over time? So, we study a lot about the team composition. So we would use different environments such as Antarctic where people are sequestered in a place where they can't easily leave in small teams under some pretty challenging circumstances for months at a time to say how does that weigh on the situation and what is the time course of change look like there? Because there is a relationship between the physiological and the psychological and vice versa. We know there's a neurohumoral connection, your body is releasing various hormones and chemical factors that have an interplay between those two. And that's part of what we do. And it's this level of research where we say I don't have an answer yet for people to apply in that area, but it's very data hungry. You know? In order to interpret what those changes mean and there's a lot of individual variability that we have to account for. Each person has kind of a unique way they handle it. Some of it could be at a genetic level, some of it at a physiological level, so we're also trying to weigh those factors in.  Host: I love your perspective, Jen. I love the breakdown there and then also just your inquisitive nature and all these questions that are just open and things that we have to understand. It's a wonderful addition I think to this group and Sharmi's experience in the operations side. Now of course, we do have Serena Aunon-Chancellor, two-time returnee. You've been on the podcast to talk about just before your launch to the International Space Station and we got to have a conversation with Gates McFadden too at Comicpalooza for another one of these episodes. So, Serena, welcome back. I'm happy to have you on.  Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Hey, thanks, Gary. I almost forget about that conversation with Beverly Crusher from the Starship Enterprise, but yeah, that was fun.  Host: Good. So, tell me about your perspective. You have the unique perspective of not only being a medical doctor and being in the same circles as Sharmi and Jenn, but a lot of these questions that Jenn was just bringing up about what's happening to the human body, and especially in space and what we know on the International Space Station, you got to experience that yourself.  Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Yeah, absolutely. And I will say that that question you asked Jenn was probably a question that deserves five days of discussion and she definitely did it in about 6.2 minutes, so I am impressed. Yeah, you know, I think after being up there for 197 days you learn what's important. And as Jenn said, there's so much individual variability, not only with the physiologic changes we see with the body, but what's important behaviorally. And I think what was driven home for me during that long time away, I began to think about hey, if I were on Mars and not on station, what would I be missing? And I'd be missing looking at the Earth. I'd be missing that direct contact with my family or with my friends where I can call them, and it sounded like a cell phone call. Those resupply missions, we get very easily where we got a little bit of fresh fruit and variety in food and -- and then I translate that to Mars and I think, oh goodness, are we only going to be eating potatoes? Because if it's all potatoes, Gary, I don't know that that's going to work right now. So, you know, it's -- what I -- and Jenn also mentioned the analog environments, which was fantastic. Because I got the chance to take part in a couple of those. One being Antarctica and then one living under the sea. So, it's sort of these extreme environments where your body is put in situations where you're extremely isolated and just having to go through harsh conditions. And I did find a tremendous crossover with what I experienced during those sorts of missions and what I needed during station. And for example, you know, how important was exercise? How important was it to be in touch with family? How well did I sleep? And I found that I slept very well during Antarctic missions, which might surprise people. But on station, I slept equally as well. So, I found that my body reacted the same, and so they're tremendous training environments. But again, thanks for having me on. I'm excited to get through these topics today.  Host: Yeah, me too, absolutely. And I think going back to Jenn's point, based on what you were saying, Serena, I think what's fascinating about this conversation is you know, especially from your perspective, Serena, you know, having this personal experience on sleeping and how the body reacts in space station and Antarctica, it's important to consider, you know, as Jenn was saying, this individual aspect, you know, when it comes to a successful mission on what would be Mars, you know, factoring in this -- your data point as one of many data points with a lot of other folks who have done the same thing that you have, Serena.  Serena Aunon-Chancellor:  Yeah, absolutely. And I think probably one of the toughest things to do, a lot of engineers and folks want to know exactly how the human body is going to respond to a variety of situations. And that could be to increase temperature inside the cabin after landing or for a two-year mission onboard ISS, and the first thing we ask back is well which human? Because there's so much individual variability. And that's the best part about spaceflight and the hardest thing to deal with. You have to make sure that all of those humans, those special humans, are, you know, they're part of that human system that have to fit into the overall system. And not just survive but thrive. And how do we do that? That's, again, one of those most challenging things we're looking at right now in every part as we head back to Mars. Or head to Mars, I should say. We haven't been there yet.  Host: A very big question. We've been talking a lot about the International Space Station. We've even brought in some of these ground analogs, Antarctica being one of them. Kind of want to continue that discussion before we go onto Mars. Because it might set a really good foundation of what we know and what we're continuing to research right now. And just some of that questions that we're continuing to ask. Sharmi, I know you have a lot of experience as a flight surgeon. Operations, day-to-day aboard the International Space Station. Your perspective on some of the research, some of the things that we're looking at, regarding the human body and in space. Things like physical health, things like mental health, the training, some of these counter measures that Jenn was previously mentioning. Some of those things that we're looking at aboard the International Space Station.  Sharmi Watkins: Sure, and I think ISS is one of our very best analogs. Especially as we talk about the transit to and from Mars. So, we have had you know, 20 years of experience. We've started to understand more and more about how the human body adapts to microgravity and how it really can thrive in microgravity. As Serena was pointing out, we don't just want to make this a survivable experience, we want to make it an enjoyable experience where humans can really be as creative as they need to be to learn about Mars and to enjoy the missions. For us, I would say, you know, on ISS, some of the things we have learned about are those first few days in flight and what the human body does to adjust. And I bet Jenn can get into this a bit more. But you know, one of the big things that we deal with immediately in flight is this shift of fluid from the feet toward the head, as we don't have that gravitational gradient acting on the body fluid. And so those shifts in fluids can cause some you know, maybe less than ideal situations in those first few days. You can be a little stuffy, maybe have a headache. And I bet Serena can tell us a little bit about that as well. But what's incredible is within a few days, most of our crew members are kind of back to being at a baseline, you know, they don't have headaches, they're not as stuffy. They can work and live, you know, just like they would on Earth. And so, I think that's incredible to know how quickly the body adapts. And there's lots of things happening behind the scenes in terms of blood volume and changes to immunology that we have had the chance to learn about on the research side. The other things that we learned about are kind of longer term. We've learned about how psychosocially our teams adjust and adapt. And we pick some pretty amazing people, like Serena. And so, these folks are not, you know, just individuals up there, they're a team. And so, we've learned how to select people who have really great attitudes toward learning and changing environments and the unpredictability of life on the station. Because you may have one plan for a day, and then you know, maybe there's a different activity that gets put on your schedule. And you just have to roll with it. So, I'm always amazed by our crew members' ability to adapt or to go out on extravehicular activities in their spacesuits to do maintenance activities or something unplanned. That ability to adjust and adapt and bring your best game is something that we have learned about over time and we do that by not only understanding how to pick great people, but also how to train them and how to work in that environment. And then I would say counter measures are the other thing. We've learned how to deal with the problems that we have detected. So, we've learned that you know, in the absence of this gravitational gradient, that bone and muscle might suffer. But we've also learned exactly the technologies that we need to maintain the bone strengths and the muscle strengths and the frequency with which we need to do that exercise. And so that is something incredibly powerful that we will take in the future missions is just understanding what we have, what resources we have and technologies we have available to us to deal with those things. And I think Jenn would be able to help us tremendously on this topic, so I'll ask her what she has to add.  Jenn Fogarty: Yeah, I'm -- I think Sharmi you covered it really well. You know, from a research perspective, thinking about how we're going to apply it, I think you enumerated all the things that we really try to understand, characterize, and you know, the other element was understanding the change over time. You talked about the importance of identifying how the individual might adapt. And it can be a bit disruptive at first. But they come back to a new baseline. We actually have a bunch of different characterization phrases for it where you know, space normal, you know, and people are like what does that look like? And it's like well, it's you, it's just the new version of you. And to relate and give people context. You know, when you go, we live at sea level here near the Johnson Space Center. Sometimes below sea level. And any given day. And then -- so you put your flight to go skiing, you go to altitude, that's a pretty abrupt change for the human body. And some people struggle more than others. And Serena brought up the individual, you know, variability of it. And you have folks who are quick adapters, folks who are slow adapters, and there's pros and cons to both aspects. It's not good or bad. It's just different. And really our job is to understand how to help the people who need the help and when they need it, in terms of the crew members. The other aspect that we focus on to unable living like a Martian during the transit is to be able to translate the counter measures, the testing, and make it doable for the type of constraints we're going to have when we do the Mars mission. So, Serena brought up, you know, the lack of resupply. And that is really the reality that the mission from Mars is much more autonomous, the most extreme version of autonomy that will exist because of the logistics around orbital mechanics, you know? Well the physics we're not going to break or bend. And trying to say OK, well if we can't do exactly what we did on station, how do we make it doable and still achieve the outcomes we desire for the Mars mission? And that's really where a lot of our current work is. Because we have to artificially create that problem here in low-Earth orbit or on Earth to some degree to really drive that sense of urgency and need. And I often, you know, try to describe to give people kind of the mental image that when you're going to do a Mars mission, that's the ultimate in living off the grid. That the concept that that vehicle is not really a vehicle anymore. Because I think it conjures up the idea of you know, a plane or a car and you can stop and get resupply, you can't. Yeah, this is an exoplanet. It's on the outbound trip, it's going to have to have everything those crew members need to enable the best mission possible from a health and performance perspective. And I think Serena mentioned the other phrase is human system. That it's one of many systems like guidance navigation control, or propulsion, that have to work seamlessly with the vehicle. They're dependent on each other. So, when you talk about OK, well if you're going to do exercise, you're going to consume more oxygen, you're going to produce more carbon dioxide, by design. We're going to make you work hard because living in microgravity isn't very demanding on your body and your body's going to detrain and when you get to the Mars surface, you need to be fit enough to do the job in a partial gravity field. So, we have to make sure you stay more robust than the microgravity environment needs you to be. So, in the process, we're going to make you use resources and we're going to have you produce something in excess that now the vehicle has to consume. It has to clean the air. Well what's interesting is different technologies allow you to remove the carbon dioxide and they allow you to then make water from it. It takes a process, but we got to work with the engineering community. So now only do we do human research, but our human research intersects with the vehicle and engineering community to say well how do we do this whole life cycle? And then the other aspect is some of the more harsh exposures that we don't have here on Earth, like the space radiation. It's a completely different type of exposure. It's not like the radiation here, we're trying to understand what that means biologically. And again, a lot of times it's scary because it's unknown. But we got to learn a lot more about it. So, we've been doing a lot of work to fill in those gaps. But really try to help people understand OK, well now not only do we fill in the gaps and understand from low-Earth orbit, but we have a whole new paradigm we have to accommodate. So, how do we do these stretch goals? How do we enable autonomy still safely and allow the crew to be performance ready?  Host: I love that. There's so many human health elements to this. And so much that we learned just in your short description, Jenn, of all the different considerations and what we have to think about for a Mars mission. There's one that Sharmi said that I found interesting and that was the -- that was the psychosocial aspect of this. And Serena, this is something that you have personal experience with. It's the idea of you know, I guess there's this mental health component but that also, the fact that you're stuck on this vehicle with the same people for a long period of time. And I think what's interesting is for the International Space Station, you spend I think somewhere maybe upwards of six months on station. But on a Mars mission, that would be just the beginning. You're going to be stuck with those people for a lot longer than that. So, some of the things we've learned about group dynamics and the mental health of keeping up your performance for that long. For a mission to Mars.  Serena Aunon-Chancellor:  Yeah, absolutely. I think what you just talked about was key. And actually, when my crew came back and we usually come up with recommendations about what we thought was important, why we thought we had a successful mission. And one of the -- one of our top three was something we called self-care and team care. And these are very basic concepts. Expeditionary teams look at these all the time. But what it breaks down to is you know, you have to understand how your behavior impacts others. And how it can impact the team itself. So in a sense, when you're on a expeditionary class mission or on station for 200 days, you need to be aware that the things you do, whether it's you leave your toothbrush floating and you don't attach it down properly, you don't take out the trash, because believe me, someone's got to take out the trash on ISS. It's not the same way we do it here, but we've got to package it up and put it in a special bag. If someone's not taking care of those small things, then things deteriorate very quickly. And so, we have a lot of -- we had a very interesting mission when we were up there. We had a hole in one of our Soyuz vehicles. We had another launch vehicle that aborted on its way up. There were a lot of very stressful events that occurred. And when my crew and I sat and talked about it and said “hey, even with all these stressful things happening, why do we think we're having such a successful mission?” And a lot of it was the interaction we had between each other. And then we put time in daily to make sure we nurtured ourselves and nurtured each other. And that could be something as simple as hey, I see Drew or Ricky working really late tonight on a project, they seem behind. And even though I am tired, I'm going to go over to them, float over, not walk over, and say “hey, can I put your tools up for you? Can I help you?” Gary, it's little things like that, it's please’ s and thank you’ s, it is the small things that keep everybody even keel on a long mission like that. It may sound very simple and very small, but they are highly, highly effective. And they will become even more important as you're headed towards Mars. Because like you said, it's going to be a much longer period of time and we're not going to have the luxury of all this space that we have onboard ISS. Because I think people still think we're going on this little camping mission on ISS, but man, ISS is big. I did not want for any more space. I didn't feel claustrophobic or trapped. I could have hung out in the gym for hours and nobody knew where I was. So, it's one of these things where the game is going to change as we head towards Mars. Just because we are limited by technology.  Host: You know, it's funny. These things that we're learning about Mars and how to have a successful Mars mission. It seems like that's one of those things is those team dynamics, Serena, about just, you know, it's almost like the training is be a good person and be a team player one-on-one. But it's that thing that's so important to living over such a long period of time. And Serena, your comment about how big the space station was and having plenty of space. I think there is a human component to that. Having enough room on your journey. And thinking about that, Sharmi, over to you, for what a transit habitat may look like, a vehicle that's on its way to Mars. I know just from some of the other episodes we've done in this series of our Mars Monthly series, we've had chats with some of the folks that are thinking about what that's going to look like. And it's not going to be as big as the International Space Station, it's going to be tight quarters. So, you know, my initial thought is some of these team dynamics that Serena was just talking about is going to be that much more important on the ride to Mars.  Sharmi Watkins: Absolutely. Yeah, we don't have a really clear idea right now about exactly what this Mars vehicle is going to look like, but we do know what the key components will be. And so, from a health and medical perspective, there are a few things that we definitely need to see on this transit vehicle. And we talked about exercise counter measures being so important. We expect to see exercise capabilities. Now it may not be what we have right now on the International Space Station where we have, you know, essentially advanced resistive exercise device that is a fancy weight machine that functions in the station and that has its own vibration isolation. And it may not involve something like the treadmill that we have. But something that can give a full body workout, both cardiovascular and resistive workout, we expect to see in that transit vehicle. We also, for the reasons that we talked about, this long transit where you need to be a team, but you also need your individual space, we expect to see private crew quarters, and they may be something like we have right now on ISS. And for those who may have seen those, they look something like, you know, phone booth sized. And Serena can maybe talk about what it's like to live in a space like that, but it's your space. And I think that's one of the key things we want to see for the transit vehicles. We need private space where you can get away from the crowd when you need to, send an email privately, possibly talk with your family privately either in real time or record something to send forward. I also know that one of the most important parts of the day is mealtime. And whether or not the food is potatoes or something else, and Grace will kill me because I know Grace did a podcast where you talked extensively about what we're doing for our food --  Host: Right.  Sharmi Watkins: So, it will be good, I think. [Laughter]  Serena Aunon-Chancellor:  Thank goodness. [Laughter]  Sharmi Watkins: I got you, Serena, we're working it. Shared meals is hugely important. And I bet Serena can talk about that. But we try right now in the International Space Station if at all possible, to schedule folks so that they can have their meals together. Because that's such a part of team building. Sharing your day, talking about what's going on back home. So, we expect to see a place for folks to share meals. And then medical. You know, we expect to have routine check-ups. As we start planning for Mars, we expect even things like your routine dental visit might happen in that transit vehicle. So, there needs to be a space for us to do those routine exams. And then, in the event that something unexpected happens, we need a space where we can do urgent care level care for patients as well. So those are just some of the parts of what we anticipate seeing. I think a few of the things that are maybe still open are whether or not we'll do any extravehicular activity in transit. If so, then we also need an air lock. And we'll need power and logistics and other key components. But I would say from the health and medical perspective, the few things that I just mentioned are the ones that we are most interested in seeing as the designs come to fruition.  Host: You know--  Serena Aunon-Chancellor:  Hey, Gary. Can I put in a plug for sleep?  Host: Oh, yes. Please do. Sleep is important.  Serena Aunon-Chancellor:  Oh, thank goodness. OK. I could probably use a nap right now. But I -- because Sharmi did a great job with all those, and I -- I can't believe I'd say I've forgotten this, I haven't forgotten, but sleep on orbit, especially when you have constant operations all the time, is so important. We really try to get all the sleep we could each night. And amazingly, for example, here on Earth, even on the weekends, I'm up at a reasonable hour, 7 am, let's say. On ISS though, when we would sleep in on Saturday and Sunday, very often we'd sleep in until 11 or noon. And I haven't done that since I was in college. So, I felt like we were catching up. What I did notice is that when the crew did not have adequate sleep, you know, adequate sleep times or adequate time off, on the weekend, productivity declined. Moods declined. It was that much harder to get work done on a Monday when you didn't have that Saturday and Sunday off. And you could have been doing something really super cool, but if you weren't rested, it impacts you. So, I think that's going to be one of our most difficult challenges, certainly on the way out. Surface stay itself, because you're trying to get so much done in a really crunched time period, and then finally on your way back. But again, it sounds like something really simple. Sleep is absolutely critical.  Host: You know, I -- just from talking to some folks on this podcast and talking about this very thing. Sleep. I know I've tried to incorporate getting the right amount of sleep in my own life. I think what's interesting about this sleep thing is you know, we've -- like I said, we've done a few of these Mars Monthly episodes and we've talked about some of the considerations for sleep. And some of those activities that will need to be done in transit to Mars. Serena, I think what's interesting about your comment is it's -- you know I think one thing, and I think this is pretty common for a lot of long duration astronauts on station, is you guys are so busy. All the time. You have so much work to do. Utilization is at a -- it seems to be at a peak right now. Where there's so much research, so much work to be done, and not enough people to do it. So, you guys are working long hours and doing a lot of things. It begs the question, you know, in transit to Mars, will it be the same? And I know we've had some conversations in the past. And some of these past episodes about you know, maybe that transit vehicle will not look like a fully utilized International Space Station, which now is focused completely on research. You know, how do you use your time, how do we use astronauts' time on the way to Mars? Perhaps instead of it being research, which will still be a part of it, but maybe not as much time, perhaps it will be at the system level where instead of a quick disconnect or a plug and play of a system, there might be a little bit more time to design systems to not have these quick disconnects components and just get into the nitty gritty of these systems. Is that one of those considerations for in transit, Serena? Just some of the things that you'll be doing and the time that you'll be working, so that you don't get in a position where on the weekends, you're catching up on sleep because you're working so hard?  Serena Aunon-Chancellor:  Yeah. Gary, that's a great point. I think it's going to be a work in progress. I don't think in transit to Mars is going to be exactly like how we do daily ops onboard ISS. People need to realize we have gotten really good and really efficient at getting things done onboard the ISS. Our timeline is marked out to five-minute increments. That's how good procedures have gotten. That's how good preventive maintenance tasks have gotten. Communication with the ground. It is real time. We get so much done. So, I think in transit to Mars, it's going to be a little bit of discovery. I think the crew may take a little bit more of a key role in planning out their daily tasks, along with [Mission Control Center] MCC. Because remember, that time delay is going to be creeping in. So, it's not going to be as easy to talk with mission control. And with that comes a sense of autonomy. And a sense of you control your schedule. Which I think the crew will appreciate. And besides sleep, Gary, I should have mentioned coffee. Coffee is critical. Do not run out of coffee, do not drink 75% of the coffee on the way to Mars and have nothing on the way back. I will say that was one of the other very highly talked about topics onboard ISS was the types of coffee we had onboard and when was the next shipment coming up.  Host: Wow, how about that. And I know that was -- I actually had a conversation about that. We got into it with Grace Douglas just on one of the things, you know, not only nutrition that we got into talking about. But we were talking about variety. And just how important that was. And this seems like Serena, for you, it was quantity, seems to be a consideration. You needed to have enough coffee.  Serena Aunon-Chancellor:  Quantity, variety, but what Sharmi said was true, that we really do try and eat together a lot of the time. Mostly, we love each other's company, but also because we all have different types of food. And so, we're sharing. And you do get tired of the beef steak that the Americans send up every now and then. So, we like to take advantage of all the different types of Russian food. That's a big bonus up there.  Host: Very cool. Jenn, I know a little bit before you were talking about some ground analogs. We're spending a lot of time talking about the International Space Station here, but a lot of the things we're talking about are team dynamics. And these -- the human element. And I know that some of this research extends beyond the International Space Station, we've already mentioned Antarctica. And there's really places all over the world where we can get a better understanding of just what it takes to be a successful team on these long, long missions. Some of the work there, Jenn, for ground analogs?  Jenn Fogarty: Yeah, sure, and yeah, you mentioned a key one. And they're all very complementary to each other, right. They're all trying to fill in those very unique niche characteristics that we will not really come together until you do the actual Mars mission and so you use them kind of systematically. We say like, say some of the element, particularly of ISS and the Antarctic is field research. Right, there's a lot of aspects of the variables you don't control. There's a lot of noise coming in when you're trying to measure something really sensitive. And there's been all really great examples throughout your conversation with Serena and Sharmi about what real life is. And how it happens operationally. And then when you're trying to do science, like how do I isolate when I'm trying to understand? And whether it be physiological or psychological or team dynamic, like how do I understand what contributed to the good outcomes and maybe what contributed to the not-good outcomes? And how do we tease them out. So, then we take things into analogs that are a little bit more laboratory like. So, we have a human exploration research analog there at Johnson Space Center. Which runs 45-day missions right now. And we're increasing that capability, that duration of isolation at the very operationally designed facility. It has, we can manipulate, say, the habitable volume, which you were talking about recently. Like how much room do people need? And if you don't have adequate space, or if you don't have adequate privacy at times across a mission of different durations, how does that really impact the individual and then of course the team? Meaning they're not mutually exclusive. Right? So if someone is -- has poor sleep because the noise isn't properly controlled or they don't feel comfortable or whatever's going on with them, well then when they got to go to work and be part of the team, you know, their stress and anxiety will probably get pushed off onto the rest of the team. So, we try to understand those and push and pull of individual versus team and leadership and followership as we know it. Because again, this mission has -- as they've theorized, has a lot of diversity along the way. The other one is a facility in Europe at the German Aerospace Corp. Known as DLR. And that's in Cologne, Germany. And that is Envihab and that's quite an extensive facility that can do isolation confinement. And also, can do environmental chambers while we're manipulating people posturally to mimic microgravity. So, it has a lot of capability to do what is called head-down bed rest. It also has a short on centrifuge, so we can test other counter measures like artificial gravity. Which is not completely off the table. It comes and it goes. [laughter]—sorry for the pun—but, uh, you know, what you’re trying to do with a lot of the work we do and the evidence we try to develop and listening to Serena and Sharmi, we're in the background collecting data on what they know works and doesn't work because we have to be able to go to the table with numbers. Because now it goes down to how do you trade off what is needed more? You know, when we talked about really constrained resources, like well if I take a resistive exercise device, will I have enough capability to have as much food? You know, because really those are the hard decisions that have to be made when you only have so much, you know, launch mass capability. So, it's an interesting dynamic to take what you, what we take for granted essentially. Access to your refrigerator and your water faucet, and turn them into, we have to know exactly how much water has to be taken on the mission, whether it to be just to hydrate somebody or to rehydrate food, because the other aspect, I'm sure you got to this when you talked to Grace, is how palatable the food is. It isn't just about enough calories per day, and Serena was pushing on this with a variety of food. Was there has to be an element of I enjoyed it. You know? That I'm not, you know, and I think they've portrayed it really well in \"The Martian,\" like yeah, it's good to have the potato because you have nothing else. But after a while, choking down that potato is not a trivial task. And we do know whether it be from the Department of Defense or people who have been on exploration missions, if you don't have the right food, you can completely undermine a mission. You can end it. And you can end people's lives. So, it becomes a very serious application of saying well, what is the right combination of variety and caloric intake and nutritional composition? And how do we bring it all together, you know, under the conditions of the logistics management that you mentioned? Like we're not going to resupply. If you forgot something, it's not going to happen. It won't be there. You don't get a second chance. So, we're very cognizant of using the depths of analogs to tease out all those special vulnerabilities and to start to quantify them. So, we can measure them against each other and have, you know, a cogent argument when you've got to make a decision between really two hard things to choose between. And the crew needs to know these things. Like part of it is a sense of being, beings that are thinking and knowing about what's happening, and playing an active role in the mission, it's transparency. A lot of times you can deal with something even though it's hard because you've been given information. Because you feel educated about the choice being made. It may not be fun, it may be really challenging, but you have a sense of control if you have the information. And that's a lot of -- when we talk about the psychosocial elements of it, how do you enable to crew to deal with really challenging things? There will be conflict. You can't avoid it complete -- it's not healthy to try to do that. That's usually just denial. But if the team runs into disagreement and runs into conflict, they have tools to arbitrate the situation. And they are -- they're not stressed by too much sleep deprivation or poor food, you know. In the background. Those are just stressors, you know, like being hangry is not a joke. You know, in every one of our lives, whether it's, you know, even at work now, I said I've learned more about working at NASA having raised a child and had a toddler because I get it now. Like I was like oh, I don't remember being raised and being a little kid, but now that I saw my son being raised and being a kid and saw these things happen, when I go to work, I'm like, oh you either need a nap or you need a snack, and then we can come back and do some productive work. But you know -- but that's, we're all still there. You know, that is the human need. I mean if you don't meet your basic functions, you've got a problem. In a constrained environment, if you're not prepared to meet those basic needs that might be changing over time, you're going to have a problem. And exploration in general has shown that over and over again. So, we're very acutely aware of the specificity of need. But how do you accommodate that when I've got to plan ten years ahead of time or we have to plan ten years ahead of time? It's a little bit of a daunting task. But that's why you said in the very opening, that's why we're here. That's that challenge that keeps us going. Like we can do this. I think it's really important to continue to understand what those things are and how we do them. So, you know, the analogs here on Earth have been invaluable. We work with our Russian counterparts at a facility called NEK [a Russian experiment facility] that hosted the Mars520. That's an unprecedented isolation analog. That really started out a lot of vulnerabilities of humans and a multicultural element, which is most likely the way we're going to do exploration. So, it's very, very informative.  Host: You know --  Serena Aunon-Chancellor:  Very well said.  Host: I think it's so incredible just how much this is informing all of, you know, what it takes to live successfully together. And just how important, it really drives home just how important these team dynamics and the, you know, the psychological and the social elements of what makes -- what will make a Mars mission successful, just how much that is. Jenn, I think I'm still at that phase where I need a nap and a snack before I go to a meeting. So, I know I still have a lot of growing to do myself.  Jenn Fogarty: No, I don't think you ever outgrow it. I think that's the fallacy. You know, like in Europe it's not uncommon to have your mid-day, they have a huge meal, they get their nap, you know. I don't think -- I think we've expected us to grow out of it and that's probably maybe an unrealistic expectation. So, we force the issue. But you know, the other thing that Serena brought up and I think you brought up was this trip and the way training and work -- will be different. And you know, so utilization will be a completely different concept. In terms of you know, a lot of what we're doing on station, especially for that spin back to Earth, it's not that it's not possible, but it'll look completely different. And what we are worried about over time is making sure the crew has meaningful work. There could be long bouts of a lot of monotony, you know, when you're talking about this mission, if we don't plan it properly. And it -- and between sensory deprivation from a cognitive standpoint of meaningful work, or the lack of the smell of the grass or the feel of the breeze and you know, the warmth of the sun, those are all important things that we are so accustomed to that we have to find a way to give someone some sense of those things that really were meaningful to them and rejuvenating. When Serena talked about adequate rest, number of minutes of sleep are incredibly important. I just heard a lecture from David Dinges, one of our premier sleep researchers. And no doubt, you know, less than seven hours is bad. Less than six starts to become on the order of catastrophic. We've seen that with industrial accidents, not just in spaceflight. But the idea is you also need other things that rejuvenate you. Things that aren't that work thing. You know, just not being at work isn't OK. And we've seen that actually in the COVID, you know, situation with people. Well yeah, I'm not here, but I'm also not rested. You know, so don't mistake one for the other. You got to be really clear on what is helping people become restored and able to go back to work and work really hard. And you have to identify what it means for each individual, which we should be able to accommodate by the time we do Mars missions. But it's such an interesting field that I think we learn a lot about ourselves. But we also learn maybe what we should stop expecting the human to do that's just unrealistic.  Host: You know, I don't think it's -- I don't think it's very fair that I only get an hour with you guys because I feel like I can go, I can go all day. This is just absolutely fascinating. And so, I'm trying to think about ways to bring it home. And we've been talking a lot about -- we've been talking a lot about the team dynamics. And that's just one element, really. I mean we've really gone through a huge number of topics here on what it takes to make a Mars mission successful. But I guess a good way to end maybe, and Sharmi, I'll pass it over to you, is some of those things that we don't know. That we need to spend more time trying to figure out. I know, you know, not to lead into it, but one of the things I know I get a lot of questions and I have a lot of questions myself is just about the radiation environment. It's very different on the way to Mars, it's very different on Mars, and then it's a huge consideration is just how long you're going to be out in the radiation environment. Just one of those things that's just a big unknown. And then anything else you want to add about just things we need to learn.  Sharmi Watkins: Sure. So, as we get to Mars, there's the trip out, and then there's the surface of Mars, both of which I think are going to pose some challenges. So, we talked about the International Space Station being a really great analog where we have many years of experience. But there are still some things that are happening on the space station that we don't fully understand. So, Jenn has a huge team within the Human Research Program, I say huge team, but an important team within the Human Research Program looking at something we call SANS, which is Space Adaptation Neuro-ocular Syndrome. Which is a thing that we have discovered, it's a physiologic change to the structure of the eyes. That can come with some visual changes in flight. That is relatively new to us. And by relatively new, I would say you know, last five to ten years we've been starting to understand this process that's going on with the eyes and what it might mean as we extend our missions beyond the typical six months to now about a year that we've seen. So that's one of the open questions that we need to understand a little bit more about the mechanisms and tease apart why it's happening. And then figure out whether or not that transit time to Mars would increase the risk of something happening or if it's going to be similar or if possibly that period of time in partial gravity will mitigate the risk to some effects. So that is one of the things we're looking at. You mentioned radiation. And we do know quite a bit about the radiation doses, et cetera, in low-Earth orbit, but as you well know, we have Earth's magnetic field protecting us. And as we move out into the deep space environment, it's a different type of radiation. And I'm certainly not a radiation expert, so I better be careful not to go too far out on a limb here. But we need to understand more about what that does to human physiology. The analog that we have available to us is we have you know, beams that we can use different electron types and radiation mixes to do small-scale studies. And so, we need to understand how that applies. And then we need to set limits appropriately so that we know how to protect the human from any effects we might see. And so that can be something like shielding in the spacecraft, creating safe havens, or potentially we use something like water as shielding, we often see that in sci-fi, and you know, it could work. Or we create habitats in areas where we might have some radiation protection. So, lots to talk about with radiation, not my area of specialty, but I do think that is one of the challenges that we will, we will address. And we will do that by setting limits and protecting humans from the different types of radiation. Other things that are maybe more specific to partial gravity is we haven't really done that for a long time, right. We have our lunar experience and we definitely have some precious lessons learned of what it was like for those crews to touch down. But they were in flight, you know, days to a week prior to touching down on the surface of the Moon. So very different place in their adaptation that Jenn and I talked about, in terms of what goes on with the physiology. For the crews that we have that will set foot on the surface of Mars, those folks will have been in a microgravity environment for many months. And so, they'll be in a different place in their adaptations to microgravity. And so that will likely pose some new challenges. It will be a little like, we think, coming back to Earth where there is a period of time that I bet Serena can share with us what that's like to readjust to the full 1 g, as we go to Mars, it will be something in between. And so, we'll need to understand. And it's a big unknown for us exactly how we will adapt. And we'll need to plan certain things. Like the first extravehicular activity. We're going to be really eager to go out and get those boots on the surface of Mars, and so how will we do that? When will it be safe to do that? We have some open questions there. And then one of the things we anticipate for Mars surface phase is that we will want to be outside exploring a lot in our spacesuits. And so, some of the challenges there, we talked about changes in altitude. So, change in pressure. When you go out in a spacesuit, you typically want to do that at a relatively low spacesuit pressure so that you have lots of mobility. So, you're not working hard against the pressure of the suit. But that change in pressure from maybe we'll do the transit vehicle something like sea level pressure and percent oxygen, and maybe we will have a habitat that's at a lower pressure, so it's closer to the suit pressure, so you have to do less of the pre-breathing of oxygen that we do to prevent something called decompression sickness. And if you want to go out the door a lot, because you want to do lots of activities, the closer those pressures can be, between your habitat and your suit, the better. But we have lots to learn about the best ways to do that, the safest ways to do that. And the protocols around that. So those are some of the open challenges that I see as we get ready for Mars.  Host: Absolutely beautiful. And Serena, I'm going to pass it to you to take us home here. Because we've talked a lot about the challenges of a Mars mission. And there just seems to be just so much that we have to figure out. There's a lot of work. And there's a lot of effort from all kinds of teams, you three included, just trying to figure out how to do this. But we're doing it, you know. So, Serena, I want to end on this note. Is why are we doing this? Why are we -- why explore with humans deeper into space?  Serena Aunon-Chancellor:  You know, it's a massive question, Gary. I'm really glad you asked it, though, because you look at the group that met here today to talk with you, both of whom I've known for so many years, and if I could take a step back in time and look at where we all were when we first started this and met each other, some of us were still in training, we were very junior in our roles, as young women. And we all believe though, that this was the right thing to do. That humans were meant to explore. And that we were meant to lead the way. Especially young women coming up in our fields. And it's been such an honor to know these two because again, if I could have taken a step back and said hey, 20 years from now, ladies, these are the leadership roles we're going to be in. Could you have imagined it? I'd say yes. Because I think we all know our potential. And it's that strength of character and the work ethic and the belief and the drive that we should be out there exploring, and that America should continue to lead the way, that is what drives us. We believe in science, you know, we believe that the younger generation that is constantly looking at us and looking to us for guidance and to be role models, that we always act in their best interests. We act in this country's best interests to make sure that our space program always pushes forward. You'll never hear the words \"can't do it,\" \"can't do this\" from any of us. As Jenn said, we do it, we do it because it's hard and because we love it. We love every minute of it. So, Gary, I wanted to end with saying that I am deeply honored to know these two women that I have worked side by side and together with for so long. And to me, it's really special to be able to do a podcast with both of them. And I can't wait to see what the next -- I'm going to say it, 60 years is going to bring, ladies. Because I may be 102, but we're pushing forward in space exploration.  Host: [Laughter] Wow, Serena, I could not have asked for a better ending. Thank you, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. And Jenn and Sharmi, to you as well. Thank you so much. This was an absolutely fascinating conversation. I hope to have you on again. And thanks for all you do.  Sharmi Watkins: Thank you, Gary.  Jenn Fogarty: Thank you. Pleasure being here. And thank you, Serena. That was beautiful. Appreciate it.  Sharmi Watkins: It was awesome.  Serena Aunon-Chancellor:  Love you guys!  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. What a wonderful conversation we had today with Sharmi, Jenn, and Serena about living like a Martian. Really tackled a lot and I know I definitely could have gone for a lot longer than that. I hope you've been really enjoying our Mars Monthly series.

  'AVAIL:Description': "Gary Jordan (Host):  Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, episode 64, Space Weather.  I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be host today.  So, in this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, and astronauts, all to let you know what's going on right here at NASA.  So, if you're familiar with us, you'll know that we recently just completed a five-part series on the hazards of human spaceflight.  One of those topics was on radiation and Dr. Zarana Patel gave us a great perspective on what's going on and what we're doing to learn what happens to the body when exposed to space radiation, especially for long periods of time.  So, today we're exploring what's being done right now to document radiation exposure, not only to make us-- to make sure our astronauts are healthy, but to really understand it.  So, Dr. Steve Johnson is one of the senior scientists of the space radiation analysis group.  Does not only that, but designs hardware, conducts physics modeling and 3D modeling and uses data to plan for future missions.  But first I wanted to start with Dr. Patel, who gives us a nice overview of why studying this is so important.  \n\nDr. Zarana Patel: So, to date, there are four health risks from space radiation exposure that we identify.  The first one is cancer, the risk of radiation-induced carcinogenesis and that includes epithelial cancers and leukemias, and this is actually the biggest contributor to this permissible exposure limit that-- that's the standard we set for our astronauts.  The next one is the risk of in-flight and late CNS decrement.  So, CNS is central nervous system, and basically it's the risk of behavioral or cognitive decrements, either in flight or late post-mission, which can manifest in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's.  \n\nHost: Oh, wow.  \n\nDr. Zarana Patel: In this one, we're targeting pathology that can have commonalities between those disorders and cardiovascular disease, which brings me to the next risk, which is the risk of radiation-induced cardiovascular disease.  But it's not just cardiovascular disease, it includes things like cataracts and other degenerative tissue effects, such as immune decrements, respiratory and digestive dysfunction, early aging or premature aging.  And, finally, the last one is the risk of acute radiation syndromes.  This is really a specific one for solar flares or what we call solar particle events.  So, this one is a more intermittent, but large-dose exposure from a solar flare and you have things like skin burns, prodromal responses, nausea.  This one is fairly effectively shielded against.  \n\nHost: That was a clip from our first episode on the hazards of human space flight, radiation, but today we're diving deep into our real-time operations dealing with radiation and space weather with Dr. Steve Johnson.  So, with no further delay, let's get right to it.  Enjoy.  \n\n[ Music ]  \n\nHost:  Thanks for coming today, Steve.  This is an interesting topic.  I'm calling it space weather, but it's-- I don't think it's exactly what it sounds like.  When I think of weather, I think of rains, clouds, I think of thunder, but space weather is a little bit different, isn't it?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Well, it's a little different, yes, but it's similar in that it's a changing environment.  In this case, rather the changing environment of the atmosphere around us.  We're looking at how the environment is changing in space around us.  And, in this case, what the parameters that are changing are charged particles, magnetic fields, the solar wind-- a lot of different parameters, but in the end it's the charged particles and the radiation that we're most concerned about and we want to monitor how that changes with time and what drives us-- what drives all of these dynamic changes or changes that occur at the sun on various time scales.  And so we want to be kind of solar physicists in a way, but that's what starts the cold front and warm fronts or whatever, if you will.  They have the influences to change how the space environment changes around us.  \n\nHost: Really, so it's mainly an environmental thing.  The changing environment, that is the weather, but it seems like the sun is the primary source of that weather.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Yes, it is.  \n\nHost: OK.  So-- and you said-- I guess we'll start with radiation because radiation is probably one of the more significant things that you're looking at.  Right?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Well, that's our primary purpose is for-- we want to monitor the radiation environment for crew health purposes, for radiation health and protection.  We also advise the flight team when there are changes in the environment that may be of concern to people that have, say, hardware that are-- might have-- are sensitive to radiation, but our primary focus is working within-- at least for the operations crew within the space radiation analysis group.  The operations portion, that's our primary focus is to watch out for the crew.  \n\nHost: Yeah.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: And actually it kind of turns around the other way.  A lot of times it's watching out for the flight control team because everybody hears radiation and everybody goes hysterical.  You know?  And so a lot of times we're-- more often than not, we're preventing radiation hysteria and saying no, this isn't a big deal, just calm down and this is-- this is fine, you know, we don't need to do anything.  And so, more often than not, that's our story then the sky is falling.  \n\nHost: Yeah, exactly.  And it's not so much, you know, we have to worry about the folks here on Earth, it's the folks here on Earth worried about what's going on in space.  We've got a nice little protective bubble, the magnetic sphere, right, that keeps us kind of safe.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Between the atmosphere and the-- Earth's magnetic field, we get a lot of protection.  And the space-- and the space station gets a lot of protection from the magnetic field.  Most of the time we're protected.  Maybe say 95% of the time we're protected by the magnetic field and there's only 5% of the time that we intermittently kind of slip out from underneath this radiation protection umbrella and can see free space radiation and so those are the intervals of times that we're most concerned with.  \n\nHost: Interesting.  Yeah, we've talked about radiation before on the podcast, mostly from the biological perspective, but not so much from the operational.  The day-to-day, you know, here's what we're doing every day to make sure the crew is healthy onboard.  So, I kind of wanted to start with because radiation is such a big part of space weather, diving into that.  What is radiation?  Let's start there.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Well, radiation generally is-- in a generic sense, it's transferring-- it's transfer of energy.  In the case-- in our case, in our specific application, radiation are-- is composed of charged atomic nuclei.  Usually they're fully ionized, so they don't have any electrons.  And they have very high kinetic energies and they will move along at high velocities until they encounter matter of some sort and then they will have interactions primarily with the electrons of the substrate and then they will slowly give up their kinetic energy and when people become that mass that they're slowing down in, the energy is transferred to the electrons and the electrons are what create all the bonds of all the big molecules, so we're disrupting those bonds.  And when that's your DNA, if you disrupt those bonds, you're disrupting the cellular code and you might kill the cell outright or you may have some artifact that's been modified but still stable enough to be passed on to future generations.  \nAnd it's that type of damage that becomes-- the damage of highest concern is that some stable alteration in the DNA code could be carried on.  \n\nHost: Wow.  So, it's not really something you feel, kind of, an ever presence thing.  It's something that's small but high energy and has a lot of impacts over time.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Yeah, that's right.  It's-- you can't-- you can't feel it.  \n\nHost: Yeah.  Yeah.  So, is a lot of it, you said-- like you said, coming from the sun, but is there-- is there a part that's galactic cosmic rays, anything other than the sun too?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Well, the sun gives us the short bursts of radiation that-- of high-- well, there's always-- there's always charged particles coming off the sun and that's called the solar wind and it's benign.  It doesn't have the sufficient energy to be of concern ever.  It's just the short bursts that we get during solar proton events that protons are accelerated at high enough energies that they can penetrate the spacecraft and penetrate into the person and give them some exposure.  \n\nHost: Oh.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Normally, day-to-day, we have two primary sources of radiation.  One is the trapped radiation belts or the Van Allen belts, if you will.  Those are mostly trapped protons, trapped electrons, and we pass through a certain region of the orbit where that belt comes close to the Earth.  And we pass through that about six times a day.  And then the rest of the time it's just kind of this background radiation which is from the galactic cosmic radiation.  \n\nHost: Ah.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: And the source of that is from outside the-- outside the solar system, throughout the galaxy, maybe particles even from galaxies far, far away.  And they just have very-- you know, created maybe during supernovas and these nuclei are being accelerated at very high energies and much higher than the solar protons or the trapped radiation.  They're very, very penetrating and they're also-- it's about 90% protons, so you have 10% that's not protons.  And, as the atoms get heavier, they are capable of doing more damage biologically.  They're of more concern and so when we start leaving Earth's-- low Earth orbit to be in free space, whether you're on the moon or on the way to Mars, the GCR-- galactic cosmic radiation-- the GCR exposure is increased and becomes more of a threat that, you know, we might exceed what our current limits are.  \nThere's no reprieve from this chronic low-level radiation that's very damaging and that becomes a big concern for those types of missions.  \n\nHost: You said daily dose of radiation is coming from the ever-present galactic cosmic radiation.  It's still not a lot because of the protection we have because we're in low Earth orbit versus being out-- deeper out into space.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: It's modulated, so it's-- I don't know, maybe a third or a quarter of what it would be if we were in free space.  That's the total amount of GCR that we receive while we're in low Earth orbit is about a third or a quarter of what it might be in free space.  \n\nHost: Now, I didn't realize that the-- I thought the space station was pretty low, but it seems like it's peeking out into little bits of the Van Allen radiation belt ever-- a couple times a day you said, right?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Well, you can't-- the only way you can avoid the-- that region of the trapped radiation belts that comes down real low is known as the South Atlantic anomaly.  \n\nHost: Ah.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: And very conveniently, it is located over the South Atlantic near South America.  It's slowly drifting west with time, so I guess they may have to rename it after a few decades and-- but-- because it will be in a different position, but that's part of the weakening of the magnetic field.  The only way to avoid the trapped radiation is to fly at low altitudes and then you're flying where the atmosphere is thick enough still that it really reduces the amount of radiation from the trapped protons.  But if you go to higher altitudes, you get increasingly larger trapped doses.  \n\nHost: Yeah, 250 miles above the Earth is a pretty nice spot.  It's high enough where you don't have to really worry about atmospheric drag too much, just a little bit, you have to reboost every once in a while, but it's low enough where you're getting a decent amount of radiation protection.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: It works both ways.  \n\nHost: Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: OK, less-- you know, the atmosphere being like-- the atmosphere being an influence on satellite drag, it's also a drag on protons, on the space radiation, so you have less satellite drag, you have less drag on the protons, so you really start having higher doses.  So, there winds up to be this trade that if you want to fly really high and not have reboosts because you're trying to avoid the drag of the spacecraft-- on the spacecraft-- you wind up getting more dose.  So, there is a-- there is a trade there that spacecraft drag wins in the pocketbooks.  \n\nHost: Yeah.  So, let's go into what your group does, the space radiation analysis group.  It's got quite a lot of different, I guess, areas that you're focusing on, but one of them-- one of the ones is the-- is what we mentioned up front, which is just the day-to-day operations of what's going on aboard the space station.  So, what are you doing to monitor the-- what's the radiation environment of the International Space Station?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: We go-- we-- we're part of mission control and we go in every day.  We report to the flight surgeon and the flight director.  \n\nHost: OK.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: And we go in every day and fire up our systems and make sure everything is running right, make-- check on all our instruments.  We have a half dozen radiation instruments that are on the space station.  We check on their status, check on the data trends, check on the space weather, what we see.  We coordinate with a group in the-- with NOA, National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.  They have a group that's called the Space Weather Prediction Center, which is kind of like the national space weather service, if you will.  And we talk to them-- and they're the experts-- and we compare notes about what we see for trends and it's up to us to kind of take what their total outlook is and apply it to our specific situation with our mission.  We also-- besides checking our instruments, make sure our computer codes are running, up and running.  \nCheck on just the normal admin for being part of mission operations.  What's happen-- just what's happening, you know, on the ground or what the crew schedule is and such things and put that all together.  And then we're on-call.  We have two people that are always on-call every day and we're supposed to be able to respond back within 45 minutes if we get a page and one of our-- one of our systems is a server that is ingesting space weather data and if it pulls in values that are above thresholds that we've established, then we get email notifications which tells us to come in and NOAA SWPC, space weather predictions center, will also give us a call and let us know.  So, we have a little bit of redundancy in terms of how we get notified.  We have one server is prime.  We have another server that's doing the same job, but just checking to make sure the first one's running so it'll send us a note if it doesn't-- if the prime was not running.  \nAnd then the Space Weather Prediction Center has its own email and they follow up with a phone call.  So, we're not likely-- and we have two people, so we're not likely to miss a call in.  So, that's kind of our ops work in a nutshell.  \n\nHost: Nice.  So, this-- I'm trying to think about-- you said space weather and you'll get notified if something is happening.  What are some of the events that would be happening that you would get notified and says hey come in in 45 minutes?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Well, the primary thing would be for what we would call an energetic proton event and that would be a situation where an event has occurred on the sun and normally that event is a coronal mass ejection.  There's a couple ways to accelerate protons, but the ones that really generate the events that are the big threat to us are generated by the development of a coronal mass ejection and as that coronal mass is-- becomes disconnected magnetically from the photosphere and starts to rise, there's a shockwave that goes through the corona and accelerates the protons and then that's what arrives.  But, as that develops, there's a lot of energy that's being released across the, you know, electromagnetic spectrum.  There's big-- there's large x-ray flares, which becomes our first indication that something goes on-- that something's occurring.  You know, why-- you know, we get a page if it's above an M5 flare.  \nSo, we have to go and look and see, well, why did we have that flare?  Is that something of importance?  Is it of-- is it at a location on the sun that's important or not?  And if it is important, we'll probably also have radio bursts, called type II radio sweeps, radio bursts, type IV, 10-centimeter bursts.  I like to refer to them as Dr. Pepper events, 10, two, and four, but if we get those-- and that's usually an indication collectively between a large x-ray flare and the radio burst that there is a proton event occurring and then with our knowledge of-- our situational awareness of where the regions are on the sun and what's the probable threat, we know pretty quick whether we might see protons, you know, quickly or slowly, but we kind of have a feel for being able to anticipate at that point and can respond.  And then when we cross those thresholds, SWPC also lets us know.  \nSo, the Space Weather Prediction Center is letting us know the details of the flare, about where it is, how big it was.  If they think the protons are going to come up, they have a code that they run that helps try to predict what the probability is just based on the parameters that have been active with the flare as-- at the onset of the event.  \n\nHost: So, when-- I'm guessing you're getting this data all the time.  What do you see normally?  Is it kind of going off in all different directions and don't really have to worry about it coming towards Earth very frequently?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: That's an interesting question.  There's a couple variants of that.  One is the sun is usually not very active, so--  \n\nHost: Oh, good thing for us, I guess.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Yeah, but it makes it boring for us.  You know?  Today's forecast is boring to mostly boring.  There's no sunspots on the sun today.  But on the threat end, just when something does occur, it can have a pretty wide longitudinal distribution in terms of influence.  \n\nHost: Wow.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Even though-- well, we have our best magnetic connection to somewhere on the western hemisphere of the sun.  So, if something happens there, we can have protons here almost right away.  \n\nHost: Oh.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: If it's on the east side of the sun, we may get protons, but it may take a day or so for them to get above our action levels.  I mean we can see them slowly trickle up, but they're so far away they have to diffuse across the magnetic field lines of the sun and that just takes a while.  \n\nHost: Yeah.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: So, in some cases we're directly connected, in some cases we're not so connected, but the influence can be very wide.  \n\nHost: Wow, that's kind of scary to think that something happening on the west hemisphere if-- you would see the effects almost immediately.  So, there's-- in that case, I guess, operationally there's nothing much that you can do?  You can't, you know, shelter in place or anything?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: If-- when we're-- well, we have a very good example of one that-- such an event occurred back in January of 2005 and it's a good illustration.  The protons were arriving before the flare had even finished peaking, so that was unusual just in that fact alone.  Plus it was the highest protons that-- for a particular energy band that we looked at.  Energetic protons were higher than they've been in the space program, so we had all this occurring at the same time.  Now, the thing was is that the crew happened to be on orbital paths that it was not slipping out from underneath that protection anytime soon, so we had eight hours to-- for the orbit to process before we would have the risk of the crew being-- encountering extra exposure from the sun.  And so they had just gone to bed, so we didn't do anything.  \nThere wasn't any shelter for them because there's no-- there wasn't any influence from the event because of the orbital track.  \n\nHost: I see.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: And so by the time they got up, the event had decayed a lot and so they just let them do their normal business, which is, you know, working in the lab and such.  The lab is pretty well shielded, so it's a good place to be during an event.  It's a good place to be working so we can continue our ops, you know, we don't want to stop ops, but, you know, if we need to do that, we, you know, we can make that recommendation.  But anyway, we were protected most of the time, so there's this factor of where you are in your orbit that-- that's our first question when we realize something's going on is where are we in the orbit and are we approaching one of those regions where we slip out from being not protected and so we start counting down when that's going to occur because that's when if we were going to do some sort of shelter sort of thing, if you will, that's when we would need to take that protection.  And that protection would only be for maybe 10 minutes every 45 minutes for a few hours during the day.  \n\nHost: Yeah.  When you say orbit, do you mean the orbit of the space station around the Earth?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Yes.  \n\nHost: So, depending on that position, maybe the-- are you thinking the Earth is going to maybe protect the space station and the crew a little bit more?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: No.  It's all the magnetic field.  \n\nHost: It's the magnetic field.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: The magnetic field of the Earth is not aligned with the spin axis, so it's tilted.  \n\nHost: OK.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: And it also doesn't intersect at the inner-- at the center of the planet and so it's-- that offset is-- well, that's part of what-- that tilt and offset is what creates the South Atlantic anomaly that we talked about earlier.  \n\nHost: I see.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: But it also lowers the amount of magnetic protection over the north-- northern part of North America over Canada, that's not very well protected.  \n\nHost: OK.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: And if you get over the Indian Ocean, west of Australia, that section in the Indian Ocean, when we cross those geographic points, we're crossing into areas that are not magnetically protected.  \n\nHost: I see.  So, that's your first question.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: And so that-- so that is, you know, are we approaching those regions and if we're not approaching those regions, then we're protected.  Even if there's an EVA and we had a big proton event going, if we're not crossing those specific zones, then there's no danger, if you will, from the proton event during those--  \n\nHost: Yeah.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Until you do that.  \n\nHost: So, how much of it is watching out and watching the crew health and how much of it is watching the vehicle health?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Our role is to-- is crew health.  \n\nHost: Crew health.  So, what are you doing--  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: We just provide notification.  We just tell the-- we just tell the-- I mean the flight director knows anyway.  We say, oh, we're on recall because we had a-- we've got a proton event going on.  So, we go in, once we have an energetic proton event started, we're on 24-hour coverage.  Before, our daily-- our normal routine, we only go in for the mornings just to check on everything and then we're just on-call for the rest of the day and the weekend.  \n\nHost: I see.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: But once we cross those thresholds for the protons, then we are there 24 hours.  But we will remind the flight director, oh, well, we have a proton event, you should notify the other flight control centers so that everybody knows.  So, if somebody's got equipment, you know, just put out that everybody-- just put out as a note that everybody can see when those times are and it's up to them to protect their equipment if they need to do that.  \n\nHost: Yeah.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: But our purpose is the-- strict-- is primarily the crew.  \n\nHost: Yeah, and providing information to the teams and the crew.  Are you watching the crew's radiation-- I guess how much they're absorbing over time?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Well, we make estimates about what we think they're going to receive during the course of their mission.  \n\nHost: OK.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: And then we monitor it daily.  We can't really-- we don't really monitor what their dose is exactly.  We monitor what the levels are.  So, if the dose rates are higher than we expected, then we know they're probably getting a little more dose than what we projected at the beginning or vice versa.  \n\nHost: OK.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: And-- so we watch those trends.  We watch for those trends to see if there's a change throughout the mission and once the mission is over we have some idea what the total radiation was just based on the instruments.  But more specifically, each crew member has a radiation badge that they wear, a personal dosimeter, and we get that back down when they arrive on the ground.  \n\nHost: Oh.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: And then that gets analyzed and that gives us the value that will go into their medical records.  \n\nHost: OK.  OK, so it's documented, I guess, your total career exposure.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Yes.  It's tracked for all their-- each flight there'll be an entry for what their exposure is.  We track it-- we track their exposure in terms of percent risk and not necessarily so much dose.  \n\nHost: OK.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: And so our limits are really based on risk levels.  \n\nHost: OK.  So, the limits would be-- I mean if you've flown in space x number of times and been up there x number of days, maybe you have-- you've absorbed enough radiation where that's probably your last flight.  Is that kind of how it works?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: You could get to that point, hypothetically.  \n\nHost: OK.  Yeah, no, I mean there's astronauts with hundreds of days, so I know it's like-- it's not.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: It's a function of-- the risk factors vary as you get older.  \n\nHost: Oh.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: And it varies between the sexes.  Women are more radiosensitive than men.  \n\nHost: Oh.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: And young people are more radiosensitive than old guys like me.  \n\nHost: Really?  The younger you are, the more sensitive you are to--  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Right, because you've got your cells are turning over more rapidly and so you're going through more cell generations.  Whereas when-- as you get older, cells turn over much more slowly.  So, if you have some damage to a cell, there's-- it takes longer to go through those number of generations before you might see that effect, if an effect was to occur.  The other part is is that time in your life is that we also-- you can also kind of think of it as loss of life, so to speak, quality of life.  \n\nHost: Oh, yeah.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: If you're, you know, a 40-year-old astronaut and, you know, there's some cancer takes 40 years to develop once you've had some, you know, event occur, well that makes you 80.  Well, people live to be 80, so you're really kind of still kind of in that zone where that is kind of like a loss of quality of life impact.  Whereas if you were 60 years old and flew and takes 40 years for it to develop, you're 100.  Well, are you really having a quality of life issue at that point?  Well, no, you've kind of-- you're out there where, you know, most people don't live, so you're-- it's not really a loss of life effect, so to speak.  So, as you get older, there's less time in front of you for, you know, a cancer to develop or some cardiovascular sort of issue to develop.  \n\nHost: I see.  So, for a radiation perspective, you're looking at flying senior citizens.  Not so much?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Maybe not.  \n\nHost: There's a lot of other factors besides radiation, isn't there, for what makes an astronaut successful?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Yeah.  \n\nHost: So, I mean you're watching career exposures.  You're talking about some of the dosimeters and some of the hardware actually measuring these dose rates, both on the astronaut and you said there's six-- you said there's half a dozen--  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: I said there's about a half a dozen.  \n\nHost: About a half a dozen.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: It kind of changes a little bit.  \n\nHost: So, what are the instruments and what are they doing?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Oh my.  \n\nHost: Big question.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Yeah, I should have brought a list.  Well, let's start with the simple things.  \n\nHost: OK.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: The radiation badge sort of dosimeters, they use what's called TLDs, trans-- thermoluminescent dosimeters and they're little crystals that are radiation sensitive and you zero them out, if you will, fly them, let them get exposed, and you bring them down and then you read them.  \n\nHost: Oh.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: So, yeah, but-- so you don't find out any information while they're flying.  You only get the data once you get them back down to the ground and analyze them.  And we change those out about twice a year.  \n\nHost: Oh.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: So, every six months we make a measurement.  So, it's-- it just kind of gives us an idea of what the average dose is for the six months at different locations.  So, you have the same type of measurement over a half-- over-- I don't know, a couple dozen locations.  We're reducing that slowly because we've characterized the station well enough that we can just kind of go to a few reference points and keep track of the trends.  The crew also has a badge that's similar to that, so that goes up with them and comes down with them and we read that.  \n\nHost: OK.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: The workhorse that we have is-- it's a-- it's known as a tissue equivalent gas proportional counter.  And that's kind of our workhorse.  It gives us-- it gives us the amount of-- the radiation dose rate.  It's telemeter data, so we're talking about an active instrument now.  \n\nHost: OK.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: An active instrument-- when I say an active instrument, that means it requires electrical power of some sort.  \n\nHost: And you're getting data more frequently.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: And we get data telemetered down every minute from it and so that allows us to check what the exposure rates are during proton events, so we're watching to see it, you know, how much it goes up when we hit those zones where we're not really protected in the orbit.  It also has a dose rate-- a high dose rate alarm for the crew.  If for some reason weren't in communication, they would at least get a-- some notification that there is a radiation event going on.  So, we had two-- we had two of those on-- we have two different models on station.  We also had some-- what are called charged particle telescopes, which are a series of silicon discs, wafers, not very thick, but a stack of them.  And so each one is a separate sensor and you line them up and it-- and you watch radiation as it goes, penetrates that stack of detectors and look at how much energy is deposited in each of the sensors.  \nThere may be as many as, I don't know, 10 sensors, and we had a-- we've had a couple internal instruments that are of that type of design and we have one external instrument that had three units in it that's located outside.  And we've also got these newer instruments that-- they're about the size of little-- of a oversize USB stick that sticks inside the-- the instrument itself sticks into the side of a laptop and it's also a silicon detector that's-- when I say a silicon detector, I don't mean it's detecting silicon, I mean it's-- the material is silicon and you're watching the radiation as it hits the silicon.  And it's a semiconductor, so it's basically kind of like a big diode and so you're watching the signal that comes off, how much energy's being deposited in that silicon detector as, you know, the-- as the day goes on.  \nAnd so we have-- we're kind of shifting over to those because they're much-- they're much more compact sort of instruments than the tissue equivalent proportional counter-- TPECs as we acronymize them.  \n\nHost: Yeah.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: The mass and volume are very important when we start considering going to the moon and to Mars, so having these larger detectors doesn't make sense from a mass standpoint, so we're kind of shifting over to using these smaller detectors and having those spread out around the station instead of the little passives.  For a variety of reasons.  \n\nHost: Yeah.  Seems like there's a lot of instruments, a lot of data, a lot of recording, a lot of monitoring.  Is there a database that you're keeping track of with all of these things?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Yeah, we can go back and-- I mean I do it frequently when I'm analyzing old events or whatever.  I can always go back and pull up the data from any of the proton events that we've had or at any time and look at what the trend was, what the background was for whatever purposes I'm trying to analyze.  \n\nHost: Yeah.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: And we can do that for all of our instruments.  \n\nHost: Is there-- is there any sort of predictive models where based on the information you have you can make guesses on what kinds of space weather is going to be happening or is it really just kind of reactive?  It just-- that's just the way it is.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: In terms of space weather, we're really in what would be called a nowcast situation.  So, we have to watch things evolve.  However, we have situational awareness that allows that-- we try to develop the skill to now when we have high threats and low threats and most of the time it's easy to discern that it's a low threat because these proton events and what leads to them are very, you know, specific sort of situations that aren't-- don't develop frequently.  \n\nHost: Yeah.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: So, from that standpoint, we have to, you know, on a day-to-day basis it's nowcasting.  But overall, for the solar cycle, there's a cycle effect on what the dose rates are to the-- to the crews of the station and so as the sun goes through its cycle of being from solar min to solar max, the dose rates are changing as a function of that.  And so, based on where we are in the solar cycle, we may adjust what we might project for their dose rate for their mission.  And we have some models that try to do that, but it's not an easy thing to do.  \n\nHost: What's solar min and solar max?  What's happening there?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Part of the sun's dynamics is it goes through this long-term cycle that we call the solar cycle and it goes from a period of time when there is virtually no sun spots, no features on the sun, and we call that solar minimum.  \n\nHost: Minimum activity.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Minimum activity.  And the-- what's happening is the sun's-- I was amazed when I-- when I learned this.  The sun's magnetic pole is reversing every 11 years.  \n\nHost: Whoa.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: And so, as it goes through this process of reversing, kind of in the middle of that process when it's kind of-- kind of more toward being neutral, if you will.  It's not really neutral, but kind of in the middle of that, that's when we start having all the hot-- a large number of sun spots and active regions on the sun and the sun is prone to producing these proton events.  And then that's solar maximum.  And then the field continues to flip and we get back to a solar minimum.  And so, from minimum to minimum, your magnetic polarity reverses.  And to get it back to where it was to start with, you really have to go through the cycle twice to get the pole to flip again.  \n\nHost: Yeah, that's right.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: And so there's even and odd cycles.  Well-- in conjunction with that activity, there is-- there is a way-- there's-- the output in ultraviolet in a particular wavelength changes between solar min and solar max and that wavelength is ultraviolet and it's readily absorbed by the atmosphere and it causes the atmosphere to expand.  So, when we go to solar minimum, we don't have as much of that UV radiation coming in and being absorbed by the atmosphere and the atmosphere cools and contracts.  And that makes for less spacecraft drag.  \n\nHost: Oh.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: And so, when-- during solar maximum, that ultraviolet output increases, atmosphere expands and becomes drag on the spacecraft.  So, that's why we have this solar min solar max drag on the spacecraft sort of thing.  And just as I mentioned earlier, drag on the spacecraft is drag on protons, so when you have less drag on the protons, the dose goes up.  The more drag, it goes down.  So, during solar minimum-- it sounds backwards, but during solar minimum our dose rates may be twice as high as they would be during solar maximum for our day-to-day doses.  \n\nHost: Because you have less atmospheric protection because it's--  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Because-- yes.  Yes.  \n\nHost: Wow.  That is-- that does sound kind of backwards, but then I guess--  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: And it also-- on a larger scale, it's not due to the ultraviolet, but over-- - due to the activity of the sun and the solar wind and such.  You also wind up having the same sort of cycle on the galactic cosmic radiation that it also is higher during solar minimum periods than it is during solar maximum periods.  So, solar minimum are-- we have our highest doses and then solar maximum we have lower doses, but we have the risk of these short bursts from proton events that may add to the crew exposures.  \n\nHost: Is it the-- is it the increased activity in the sun during solar maximum that's sort of pushing away the galactic cosmic rays?  Is that what-- is that kind of what's happening there?  Or is it something else?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Yeah, in a way.  It's the solar wind and a combination of a few things that, you know, the-- you know, the particles are coming from very far away and they see-- you know, there's just a little bit of influence and it changes and it just-- this far into the solar system, it does make a big difference.  \n\nHost: So, this makes me think about deep space missions.  If you were planning a deep space mission, from a radiation perspective, what's the right time?  What's the more appropriate time to send people out to-- let's just say we have gateway around the moon to send people to around the moon.  Is it during solar minimum or maximum?  Does radiation even play a part in the planning?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: It does play a part in the planning because we have to address the issue.  Does it determine the timing?  Well, if you want to make this a long-term project to be on the moon and go to Mars and not just have one shot sort of things, then you've got to just be able to deal with the risk of the exposures.  Going during solar minimum times, you're getting a lot more exposure from the GCR and that's not-- that's not a good thing, so we have to find ways to kind of try to minimize that dose somehow.  \n\nHost: Right.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: It's not easy to shield, but, you know, you go to Mars, you've got a big spacecraft, got a lot of mass, so maybe using that mass prudently, maybe you can give yourself more protection.  You get a little more protection on the surface of the moon because you've got the planetary body giving you, you know, some sort of shielding.  \n\nHost: Sure.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: But you have to consider it, but I'm not sure you can say one's a better time than the other.  You know?  \n\nHost: What about the risk of solar flares or coronal mass ejections?  Do you have to-- would you want to travel during a minimum just to avoid the off chance that you could be affected during transit?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Well, the thing is is that the solar proton events are easier to shield.  \n\nHost: Really?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Because they're lower energy.  So, you can make a shelter, if you will, that can make a significant impact on the short-term events.  So, in some ways, you know, the better time to go might be during-- if you're just trying to pick one time, you know, solar maximum may be a kind of a better time because--  \n\nHost: Lower overall dose, maybe?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: That-- the low-- the background radiation levels are at their lowest, which is what you really care about, and then the short-term bursts that are maybe high dose rate, you can shield against them.  Plus their-- the damaging capability of the protons is not the same as the higher atomic number of species that you have in the GCR.  \n\nHost: So, are you looking at mostly low Earth orbit when you're looking at all this data for radiation and monitoring the crew health, or are you really looking further out into space, you know, beyond the Earth, maybe towards the moon, Mars, in-between, to understand the environment for deep space missions?  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Well, I think we get a feel for what the environment is in general.  I mean specifically we're flying low Earth orbit, so our application is for low Earth orbit, but it's also-- we know what's happening here locally and the moon's not that far away, really, so what we see here is-- would-- is also same thing for the moon.  So, whatever our practices are in terms of monitoring-- kind of in the cislunar neighborhood, we're good.  \n\nHost: That's good.  Yeah, you don't have to rewrite everything.  Yeah.  That's good.  What-- and now for Mars, I'm assuming it's just going to be a little bit different.  Maybe communication is an issue because if a solar activity happens, you have to deal with the communication delay.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: That-- we're not-- we're still kind of working through how we might want to deal with such things.  We also need more longitudinal monitoring of the sun from other angles because what we see here on Earth may not be what's being influencing a spacecraft on it's way to Mars or at Mars.  So, it may-- you know, more resources are going to be needed in order to be able to do some-- to do-- just to monitor the space weather so we can do our forecasting and analysis and keep the crew advised.  \n\nHost: So, are you talking about like satellites and probes to go out kind of towards different areas and fill in those gaps?  OK.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Be able to see the sun from different angles.  \n\nHost: Yeah.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: We had that opportunity over the last decade or so that we've had what was called the stereo mission, which sent a pair a of space weather monitoring spacecraft, one ahead in orbit and one kind of lagging the Earth orbit and going around the sun very slowly.  It took a decade or so to get to the far side of the sun and then they switched and now they're kind of coming back.  But, that other perspective of the sun-- we need to be able to see from those other angles to really-- to do the right job to support a Mars mission.  \n\nHost: So, thinking about that-- and we can sort of wrap up with this idea-- what sorts of other gaps do we need to fill to make a deep space mission, like a one to Mars, successful?  Especially from a radiation perspective.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Well, I think the physics-- we kind of know the physics.  So, we know-- we have the type of technical information to work on shields and maybe try to optimize some shield designs to try to provide a little bit of more protection.  The big question-- and I think we can respond to the short-term influences of proton events and such, but the big question is going to be the effects of the chronic exposure to the galactic cosmic radiation.  The radiobiology, I think there's just a lot that we still don't know.  That doesn't mean we-- I don't know that that stops us from going, but-- I don't know that we'll ever have all the answers, but I think trying to get a handle on some of that is a very big challenge.  \nExposures to-- I mean we understand that-- well, I say we understand-- I mean-- radiation and cancer, that's kind of understood in a way.  I mean it's a stochastic process in that it's random whether you get an exposure and whether cancer develops, but some other things-- some other effects-- there's not really a good way to quantify them and-- for example, the neurological effects, getting radiation damage to your neural systems, what, you know, neurons don't grow back very quickly.  You know?  So, if you wind up killing off neurons here and there, that's not good.  And there may be other effects that are-- maybe with time that, you know, we'll know more about, but I think they're still hard to quantify, some of them, and those will always be a-- those will always be a challenge I think that's going to be hanging out there to understand.  \n\nHost: That seems to be a theme is there is so much that we don't know and that's the-- I guess the beauty of science is the more you learn, the more you realize that there's more to learn.  And-- but that should never stop you from exploring and I think that's what's awesome about NASA is you just kind of keep going.  You keep pursuing and it's this drive to explore that keeps us going out further.  I love it.  So, thank you, Steve, for coming on and talking about space weather and radiation, opening our eyes to this-- I guess not-seen part of spaceflight that's essential to understand to make it successful, so I appreciate you coming on.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Yeah.  Well, it is kind of an unseen thing.  We sit in the back room and nobody sees us as we come and go.  I could go throw in a story for that real quick.  \n\nHost: Yeah, do it.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: Just to finish on a-- maybe a fun note.  I was-- I don't know, I think it was the fourth of July and I was in on the holiday.  We-- because at the time we went in every single day and-- like I said, we sit in a back room, so we're never really seen.  And gone down to the Coke machine and get something to drink and the flight director comes out of the bathroom and she walks up and she sees me standing there and looks and are you-- are you one of the radiation guys?  And I go oh, yes, yes, yes, she knows who I am.  Yes.  Yes, I'm one of the radiation guys.  She goes is it a bad thing that you're here?  No, no, we're just here for our regular shift.  She was concerned that there was some proton event going on and it wasn't going to be a quiet day.  So, OK, no.  It's a nice day on the sun.  \n\nHost: All right.  Well, I guess maybe soon it will be a good day whenever people see you come out of the back room a little bit.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  \n\nDr. Steve Johnson: OK.  Thank you.  \n\n[ Music ]  \n\nHost: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So, today we talked with Dr. Steve Johnson.  We talked about space weather, radiation, and really understanding the sun and how that affects our day-to-day operations for human space flight.  We talked earlier about the hazards of human space flight.  We have a couple episodes on those, five to be exact, plus a little intro.  So, you can go back and watch-- or listen-- to those episodes.  The five hazards of human space flight, nasa.gov/johnson/HWHAP, that is our site.  Or wherever you're subscribed to Houston, We Have a Podcast.  We also work with the human research program to come up with some supplementary materials for those.  So, if you go to nasa.gov/HRP, they have a section there called the five hazards of human spaceflight and you can click on the radiation section, space radiation, and they have a lot of extra materials if you want to really learn more about the radiation environment.  Otherwise, you can go to nasa.gov/iss or one of our many social media accounts for the International Space Station on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to know what's going on 250 miles above our heads.  Use the #AskNASA on your favorite platform to submit an idea for the show.  \nSo, this podcast episode was recorded on August 14, 2018.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, Bill Stafford, Bill Foster, Pat Ryan, and Isidro Reyna.  Thanks again to Dr. Steve Johnson for coming on the show.  We'll be back next week.",

The video shows the high-energy flare as seen by Hinode's X-Ray Telescope. The emission was so bright that the initial blast caused the detector to saturate. The giant explosion sent a huge cloud of superhot plasma zooming into interplanetary space -- a phenomenon known as a coronal mass ejection. Studying large flares like this one with a variety of instruments is key to understanding exactly what causes these dramatic eruptions, and one day predicting them before they occur.",

Observations of the loops, which can be more or less tangled and complex during different phases of the sun's 11-year activity cycle, can help researchers understand what's happening with the sun's complex magnetic fields, fields that can also power great eruptions on the sun such as solar flares or coronal mass ejections. The images here show an unfiltered image from the sun next to one that has been processed using a gradient filter. Note how the coronal loops are sharp and defined, making them all the more easy to study. On the other hand, gradients also make great art.

        description: "The Sun contains 99.8 percent of the mass in our solar system. Its gravitational pull is what keeps everything here, from tiny Mercury to the gas giants to the Oort Cloud, 186 billion miles away. But even though the Sun has such a powerful pull, it's surprisingly hard to actually go to the Sun: It takes 55 times more energy to go to the Sun than it does to go to Mars.   Why is it so difficult? The answer lies in the same fact that keeps Earth from plunging into the Sun: Our planet is traveling very fast — about 67,000 miles per hour — almost entirely sideways relative to the Sun. The only way to get to the Sun is to cancel that sideways motion.   Since Parker Solar Probe will skim through the Sun's atmosphere, it only needs to drop 53,000 miles per hour of sideways motion to reach its destination, but that's no easy feat. In addition to using a powerful rocket, the Delta IV Heavy, Parker Solar Probe will perform seven Venus gravity assists over its seven-year mission to shed sideways speed into Venus' well of orbital energy. These gravity assists will draw Parker Solar Probe's orbit closer to the Sun for a record approach of just 3.83 million miles from the Sun's visible surface on the final orbits.   Though it's shedding sideways speed to get closer to the Sun, Parker Solar Probe will pick up overall speed, bolstered by Sun's extreme gravity — so it will also break the record for the fastest-ever human-made objects, clocking in at 430,000 miles per hour on its final orbits.",

        description: 'Something mysterious is going on at the Sun. In defiance of all logic, its atmosphere gets much, much hotter the farther it stretches from the Sun’s blazing surface.  Temperatures in the corona — the tenuous, outermost layer of the solar atmosphere — spike upwards of 2 million degrees Fahrenheit, while just 1,000 miles below, the underlying surface simmers at a balmy 10,000 F. How the Sun manages this feat remains one of the greatest unanswered questions in astrophysics; scientists call it the coronal heating problem. A new, landmark mission, NASA’s Parker Solar Probe — scheduled to launch no earlier than Aug. 11, 2018 — will fly through the corona itself, seeking clues to its behavior and offering the chance for scientists to solve this mystery.  From Earth, as we see it in visible light, the Sun’s appearance — quiet, unchanging — belies the life and drama of our nearest star. Its turbulent surface is rocked by eruptions and intense bursts of radiation, which hurl solar material at incredible speeds to every corner of the solar system. This solar activity can trigger space weather events that have the potential to disrupt radio communications, harm satellites and astronauts, and at their most severe, interfere with power grids.  Above the surface, the corona extends for millions of miles and roils with plasma, gases superheated so much that they separate into an electric flow of ions and free electrons. Eventually, it continues outward as the solar wind, a supersonic stream of plasma permeating the entire solar system. And so, it is that humans live well within the extended atmosphere of our Sun. To fully understand the corona and all its secrets is to understand not only the star that powers life on Earth, but also, the very space around us.',

        description: "Telescopes help distant objects appear bigger, but this is only one of their advantages. Telescopes can also collect light in ranges that our eyes alone cannot see, providing scientists ways of observing a whole host of material and processes that would otherwise be inaccessible. A new NASA movie of the sun based on data from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, or SDO, shows the wide range of wavelengths – invisible to the naked eye – that the telescope can view. SDO converts the wavelengths into an image humans can see, and the light is colorized into a rainbow of colors.  As the colors sweep around the sun in the movie, viewers should note how different the same area of the sun appears. This happens because each wavelength of light represents solar material at specific temperatures. Different wavelengths convey information about different components of the sun's surface and atmosphere, so scientists use them to paint a full picture of our constantly changing and varying star.  Yellow light of 5800 angstroms, for example, generally emanates from material of about 10,000 degrees F (5700 degrees C), which represents the surface of the sun. Extreme ultraviolet light of 94 angstroms, which is typically colorized in green in SDO images, comes from atoms that are about 11 million degrees F (6,300,000 degrees C) and is a good wavelength for looking at solar flares, which can reach such high temperatures. By examining pictures of the sun in a variety of wavelengths – as is done not only by SDO, but also by NASA's Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory and the European Space Agency/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory — scientists can track how particles and heat move through the sun's atmosphere.",

        description: 'Something mysterious is going on at the Sun. In defiance of all logic, its atmosphere gets much, much hotter the farther it stretches from the Sun’s blazing surface.  Temperatures in the corona — the tenuous, outermost layer of the solar atmosphere — spike upwards of 2 million degrees Fahrenheit, while just 1,000 miles below, the underlying surface simmers at a balmy 10,000 F. How the Sun manages this feat remains one of the greatest unanswered questions in astrophysics; scientists call it the coronal heating problem. A new, landmark mission, NASA’s Parker Solar Probe — scheduled to launch no earlier than Aug. 11, 2018 — will fly through the corona itself, seeking clues to its behavior and offering the chance for scientists to solve this mystery.  From Earth, as we see it in visible light, the Sun’s appearance — quiet, unchanging — belies the life and drama of our nearest star. Its turbulent surface is rocked by eruptions and intense bursts of radiation, which hurl solar material at incredible speeds to every corner of the solar system. This solar activity can trigger space weather events that have the potential to disrupt radio communications, harm satellites and astronauts, and at their most severe, interfere with power grids.  Above the surface, the corona extends for millions of miles and roils with plasma, gases superheated so much that they separate into an electric flow of ions and free electrons. Eventually, it continues outward as the solar wind, a supersonic stream of plasma permeating the entire solar system. And so, it is that humans live well within the extended atmosphere of our Sun. To fully understand the corona and all its secrets is to understand not only the star that powers life on Earth, but also, the very space around us.',

        description: "The sun emitted a significant solar flare on Oct. 22, 2012, peaking at 11:17 p.m. EDT. The flare came from an active region on the left side of the sun that has been numbered AR 1598, which has already been the source of a number of weaker flares. This flare was classified as an X.1-class flare. \"X-class\" denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more information about its strength. An X2 is twice as intense as an X1, an X3 is three times as intense, and on. An X-class flare of this intensity can cause degradation or blackouts of radio communications for about an hour.  Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground, however — when intense enough — they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel. This can disrupt radio signals for anywhere from minutes to hours.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, which is the United States government's official source for space weather forecasts and alerts, categorized the radio blackout associated with this flare as an R3, on a scale from R1 to R5. It has since subsided.  Increased numbers of flares are quite common at the moment, since the sun's normal 11-year activity cycle is ramping up toward solar maximum, which is expected in 2013. Humans have tracked this solar cycle continuously since it was discovered in 1843, and it is normal for there to be many flares a day during the sun's peak activity. The first X-class flare of the current solar cycle occurred on Feb. 15, 2011 and there have been 15 X-class flares total in this cycle, including this one. The largest X-class flare in this cycle was an X6.9 on Aug. 9, 2011. This is the 7th X-class flare in 2012 with the largest being an X5.4 flare on March 7.  This flare did not have an associated Earth-directed coronal mass ejection (CME), another solar phenomenon that can send solar particles into space and affect electronic systems in satellites and on Earth.",

NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory – which typically observes the entire sun 24 hours a day — captured images of the flare.   This flare is classified as an X2.2 flare. X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more information about its strength. An X2 is twice as intense as an X1, an X3 is three times as intense, etc.  About one hour later, the sun released a second X-class flare, peaking at 8:52 a.m. EDT on June 10, 2014.

They erupt as fast as 60 miles per second, and can reach lengths of 6,000 miles before collapsing. These are spicules, and despite their grass-like abundance, scientists didn’t understand how they form. Now, for the first time, a computer simulation — so detailed it took a full year to run — shows how spicules form, helping scientists understand how spicules can break free of the sun’s surface and surge upward so quickly. This work relied upon high-cadence observations from NASA’s Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, or IRIS, and the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope in La Palma. Together, the spacecraft and telescope peer into the lower layers of the sun’s atmosphere, known as the interface region, where spicules form. The results of this NASA-funded study were published in Science on June 22, 2017 — a special time of the year for the IRIS mission, which celebrates its fourth anniversary in space on June 26.',

        description: "In this video NASA solar physicist Holly Gilbert narrates a visualization of the slow changes in the sun's magnetic field over the course of four years.  Grasping what drives that magnetic system is crucial for understanding the nature of space throughout the solar system: The sun's invisible magnetic field is responsible for everything from the solar explosions that cause space weather on Earth – such as auroras – to the interplanetary magnetic field and radiation through which our spacecraft journeying around the solar system must travel.   We can observe the shape of the magnetic fields above the sun's surface because they guide the motion of that plasma – the loops and towers of material in the corona glow brightly in EUV images. Additionally, the footpoints on the sun’s surface, or photosphere, of these magnetic loops can be more precisely measured using an instrument called a magnetograph, which measures the strength and direction of magnetic fields.   Scientists also turn to models. They combine their observations – measurements of the magnetic field strength and direction on the solar surface – with an understanding of how solar material moves and magnetism to fill in the gaps. Simulations such as the Potential Field Source Surface, or PFSS, model – shown in the accompanying video – can help illustrate exactly how magnetic fields undulate around the sun. Models like PFSS can give us a good idea of what the solar magnetic field looks like in the sun’s corona and even on the sun’s far side.",

        description: "February 11, 2015 marks five years in space for NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which provides incredibly detailed images of the whole sun 24 hours a day. Capturing an image more than once per second, SDO has provided an unprecedentedly clear picture of how massive explosions on the sun grow and erupt ever since its launch on Feb. 11, 2010. The imagery is also captivating, allowing one to watch the constant ballet of solar material through the sun's atmosphere, the corona.   In honor of SDO's fifth anniversary, NASA has released a video showcasing highlights from the last five years of sun watching. Watch the movie to see giant clouds of solar material hurled out into space, the dance of giant loops hovering in the corona, and huge sunspots growing and shrinking on the sun's surface.   The imagery is an example of the kind of data that SDO provides to scientists. By watching the sun in different wavelengths – and therefore different temperatures – scientists can watch how material courses through the corona, which holds clues to what causes eruptions on the sun, what heats the sun's atmosphere up to 1,000 times hotter than its surface, and why the sun's magnetic fields are constantly on the move.  Five years into its mission, SDO continues to send back tantalizing imagery to incite scientists' curiosity. For example, in late 2014, SDO captured imagery of the largest sun spots seen since 1995 as well as a torrent of intense solar flares. Solar flares are bursts of light, energy and X-rays. They can occur by themselves or can be accompanied by what's called a coronal mass ejection, or CME, in which a giant cloud of solar material erupts off the sun, achieves escape velocity and heads off into space. In this case, the sun produced only flares and no CMEs, which, while not unheard of, is somewhat unusual for flares of that size. Scientists are looking at that data now to see if they can determine what circumstances might have led to flares eruptions alone.   Goddard built, operates and manages the SDO spacecraft for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington, D.C. SDO is the first mission of NASA's Living with a Star Program. The program's goal is to develop the scientific understanding necessary to address those aspects of the sun-Earth system that directly affect our lives and society.",

        description: "A comet's journey through the solar syste is perilous and violent. Before it reaches Mars - at some 230 million miles away from the sun - the radiation of the sun begins to cook off the frozen water ice directly into gas. This is called sublimation. It is the first step toward breaking the comet apart. If it survives this, the intense radiation and pressure closer to the sun could destroy it altogether. Animators at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. created this short movie showing how the sun can cook a comet.  Such a journey is currently being made by Comet ISON. It began its trip from the Oort cloud region of our solar system and is now traveling toward the sun. The comet will reach its closest approach to the sun on Thanksgiving Day — Nov. 28, 2013 — skimming just 730,000 miles above the sun’s surface. If it comes around the sun without breaking up, the comet will be visible in the Northern Hemisphere with the naked eye, and from what we see now, ISON is predicted to be a particularly bright and beautiful comet.  Even if the comet does not survive, tracking its journey will help scientists understand what the comet is made of, how it reacts to its environment, and what this explains about the origins of the solar system. Closer to the sun, watching how the comet and its tail interact with the vast solar atmosphere can teach scientists more about the sun itself.",

Flight controllers from the IRIS mission will present their individual experiences on IRIS from development through the first year of flight. This will begin with a discussion of the unique nature of IRIS's mission and science, and how it fits into NASA's fleet of solar observatories. Next will be a discussion of the critical roles Ames contributed in the mission including spacecraft and flight software development, ground system development, and training for launch. This will be followed by experiences from launch, early operations, ongoing operations, and unusual operations experiences. The presentation will close with IRIS science imagery and questions.",

        description: 'At any given moment, as many as 10 million wild jets of solar material burst from the sun’s surface. They erupt as fast as 60 miles per second, and can reach lengths of 6,000 miles before collapsing. These are spicules, and despite their grass-like abundance, scientists didn’t understand how they form. Now, for the first time, a computer simulation — so detailed it took a full year to run — shows how spicules form, helping scientists understand how spicules can break free of the sun’s surface and surge upward so quickly. This work relied upon high-cadence observations from NASA’s Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, or IRIS, and the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope in La Palma. Together, the spacecraft and telescope peer into the lower layers of the sun’s atmosphere, known as the interface region, where spicules form. The results of this NASA-funded study were published in Science on June 22, 2017 — a special time of the year for the IRIS mission, which celebrates its fourth anniversary in space on June 26.',

        description: "The sun is always changing and NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory is always watching. Launched on Feb. 11, 2010, SDO keeps a 24-hour eye on the entire disk of the sun, with a prime view of the graceful dance of solar material coursing through the sun's atmosphere, the corona. SDO's fourth year in orbit was no exception: NASA is releasing a movie of some of SDO's best sightings of the year, including massive solar explosions and giant sunspot shows. SDO captures images of the sun in 10 different wavelengths, each of which helps highlight a different temperature of solar material. Different temperatures can, in turn, show specific structures on the sun such as solar flares, which are giant explosions of light and x-rays, or coronal loops, which are streams of solar material traveling up and down looping magnetic field lines. The movie shows examples of both, as well as what's called prominence eruptions, when masses of solar material leap off the sun. The movie also shows a sunspot group on the solar surface. This sunspot, a magnetically strong and complex region appearing in mid-January 2014, was one of the largest in nine years.  Scientists study these images to better understand the complex electromagnetic system causing the constant movement on the sun, which can ultimately have an effect closer to Earth, too: Flares and another type of solar explosion called coronal mass ejections can sometimes disrupt technology in space. Moreover, studying our closest star is one way of learning about other stars in the galaxy. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. built, operates, and manages the SDO spacecraft for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington, D.C.",

The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) flew up on an Atlas V rocket, carrying instruments that scientists hoped would revolutionize observations of the sun. If all went according to plan, SDO would provide incredibly high-resolution data of the entire solar disk almost as quickly as once a second. When the science team released its first images in April of 2010, SDO's data exceeded everyone's hopes and expectations, providing stunningly detailed views of the sun. In the three years since then, SDO's images have continued to show breathtaking pictures and movies of eruptive events on the sun. Such imagery is more than just pretty, they are the very data that scientists study. By highlighting different wavelengths of light, scientists can track how material on the sun moves. Such movement, in turn, holds clues as to what causes these giant explosions, which, when Earth-directed, can disrupt technology in space.  SDO is the first mission in a NASA's Living With a Star program, the goal of which is to develop the scientific understanding necessary to address those aspects of the sun-Earth system that directly affect our lives and society. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. built, operates, and manages the SDO spacecraft for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington, D.C.",

They erupt as fast as 60 miles per second, and can reach lengths of 6,000 miles before collapsing. These are spicules, and despite their grass-like abundance, scientists didn’t understand how they form. Now, for the first time, a computer simulation — so detailed it took a full year to run — shows how spicules form, helping scientists understand how spicules can break free of the sun’s surface and surge upward so quickly. This work relied upon high-cadence observations from NASA’s Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, or IRIS, and the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope in La Palma. Together, the spacecraft and telescope peer into the lower layers of the sun’s atmosphere, known as the interface region, where spicules form. The results of this NASA-funded study were published in Science on June 22, 2017 — a special time of the year for the IRIS mission, which celebrates its fourth anniversary in space on June 26.',

        description: 'This 3-D video can be seen with red and cyan 3-D paper glasses.   Launched ten years ago, on Oct. 25, 2006, the twin spacecraft of NASA’s STEREO mission – short for Solar and Terrestrial Relations Observatory – have given us unprecedented views of the sun.  In 2007, STEREO provided the first multi-viewpoint images of the sun. For the first time, scientists were able to see structures in the sun\'s atmosphere in three dimensions. Then, in 2011, they gave us the first-ever simultaneous view of the entire star at once. This kind of comprehensive data is key to understanding how the sun erupts with things like coronal mass ejections and energetic particles, as well as how those events move through space, sometimes impacting Earth and other worlds. Ten years ago, the twin STEREO spacecraft joined a fleet of NASA spacecraft keeping an eye on the sun and its influence on Earth and space – but they provided a new and unique perspective.   The two STEREO observatories, called STEREO-A and STEREO-B – for Ahead and Behind, respectively – were sent out from Earth in opposite directions. Using gravitational assists from both the moon and Earth, the STEREO spacecraft were accelerated to Earth-escape velocities. STEREO-A was inserted into an orbit slightly smaller, and therefore faster, than Earth’s. For STEREO-B, the reverse happened: It was nudged into an orbit slightly larger than Earth’s so that it traveled around the sun more slowly, falling increasingly behind the Earth. As the spacecraft slowly fanned out away from the centerline between Earth and the sun – where every other sun-watching spacecraft is located – they revealed more and more new information about our closest star.   This footage is from March and April 2007, when the small separation of the two spacecraft allowed a stereoscopic view of the sun similar to how human eyes perceive the world around us. These images were captured by STEREO in several wavelengths of extreme ultraviolet light which show different layers of the sun’s atmosphere. The number in the lower right of the video shows the wavelength of light measured in Angstroms.

The sun emitted a mid-level solar flare, peaking at 11:11 a.m. EST on Jan. 30, 2014.

        description_508: 'In addition to the constant emission of warmth and light, our sun sends out occasional bursts of solar radiation that propel high-energy particles toward Earth. These solar energetic particles, or SEPs, can impact astronauts or satellites. To fully understand these particles, scientists must look to their source: the bursts of solar radiation.  But scientists aren’t exactly sure which of the two main features of solar eruptions –narrow solar flares or wide coronal mass ejections – causes the SEPs during different bursts. Scientists try to distinguish between the two possibilities by using observations, and computer models based on those observations, to map out where the particles could be found as they spread out and traveled away from the sun. NASA missions STEREO and SOHO collect the data upon which these models are built. Sometimes, these solar observatories saw SEPs on the opposite side of the sun than where the eruption took place. What kind of explosion on the sun could send the particles so far they ended up behind where they started?  Now a new model has been developed by an international team of scientists, led by the University of Central Lancashire and funded in part by NASA. The new model shows how particles could travel to the back of the sun no matter what type of event first propelled them. Previous models assumed the particles mainly follow the average of magnetic field lines in space on their way from the sun to Earth, and slowly spread across the average over time. The average field line forms a steady path following a distinct spiral because of the sun’s rotation. But the new model takes into consideration that magnetic fields lines can wander – a result of turbulence in solar material as it travels away from the sun.  With this added information, models now show SEPs spiraling out much wider and farther than previous models predicted – explaining how SEPs find their way to even the far side of the sun. Understanding the nature of SEP distribution helps scientists as they continue to map out the origins of these high-energy particles.

        description: 'In addition to the constant emission of warmth and light, our sun sends out occasional bursts of solar radiation that propel high-energy particles toward Earth. These solar energetic particles, or SEPs, can impact astronauts or satellites. To fully understand these particles, scientists must look to their source: the bursts of solar radiation.  But scientists aren’t exactly sure which of the two main features of solar eruptions –narrow solar flares or wide coronal mass ejections – causes the SEPs during different bursts. Scientists try to distinguish between the two possibilities by using observations, and computer models based on those observations, to map out where the particles could be found as they spread out and traveled away from the sun. NASA missions STEREO and SOHO collect the data upon which these models are built. Sometimes, these solar observatories saw SEPs on the opposite side of the sun than where the eruption took place. What kind of explosion on the sun could send the particles so far they ended up behind where they started?  Now a new model has been developed by an international team of scientists, led by the University of Central Lancashire and funded in part by NASA. The new model shows how particles could travel to the back of the sun no matter what type of event first propelled them. Previous models assumed the particles mainly follow the average of magnetic field lines in space on their way from the sun to Earth, and slowly spread across the average over time. The average field line forms a steady path following a distinct spiral because of the sun’s rotation. But the new model takes into consideration that magnetic fields lines can wander – a result of turbulence in solar material as it travels away from the sun.  With this added information, models now show SEPs spiraling out much wider and farther than previous models predicted – explaining how SEPs find their way to even the far side of the sun. Understanding the nature of SEP distribution helps scientists as they continue to map out the origins of these high-energy particles.

        description: "The sun is always changing and NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory is always watching. Launched on Feb. 11, 2010, SDO keeps a 24-hour eye on the entire disk of the sun, with a prime view of the graceful dance of solar material coursing through the sun's atmosphere, the corona. SDO's sixth year in orbit was no exception. This video shows that entire sixth year--from Jan. 1, 2015 to Jan. 28, 2016 as one time-lapse sequence. At full quality, this video is ultra-high definition 3840x2160 and 59.94 frames per second. Each frame represents 1 hour.  SDO's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) captures a shot of the sun every 12 seconds in 10 different wavelengths. The images shown here are based on a wavelength of 171 angstroms, which is in the extreme ultraviolet range and shows solar material at around 600,000 Kelvin (about 1 million degrees F.) In this wavelength it is easy to see the sun's 25-day rotation.  During the course of the video, the sun subtly increases and decreases in apparent size. This is because the distance between the SDO spacecraft and the sun varies over time. The image is, however, remarkably consistent and stable despite the fact that SDO orbits Earth at 6,876 mph and the Earth orbits the sun at 67,062 miles per hour.  Scientists study these images to better understand the complex electromagnetic system causing the constant movement on the sun, which can ultimately have an effect closer to Earth, too: Flares and another type of solar explosion called coronal mass ejections can sometimes disrupt technology in space. Moreover, studying our closest star is one way of learning about other stars in the galaxy.

        description: "Since February 2011, the two spacecraft of NASA's STEREO mission have been providing scientists with unprecedented views of the far side of the sun. Placed in an orbit that allows their perspective to changed over the eight years since their launch in 2008 (ck), the satellites are about to enter a new phase of their journey: a time when the bright light and heat of the sun will stand in the way of sending data back to Earth. This phase is a direct result of the orbits for STEREO, which is short for the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory.  The spacecraft travel at different speeds. This means that over time, the satellites become increasingly out of sync, appearing from Earth's perspective to drift farther apart, able to observe first the sides and eventually the far side of the sun. For the first time ever, thanks to STEREO and near-Earth solar telescopes such as NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory the human race has had its first 360-degree view of the sun.  The orbits have continued to cause the STEREO spacecraft's position to change, however, and now they are nearing each other once again, this time on the other side of the sun. During this period when the sun blocks Earth's view — a geometrical position known in astronomy as a superior conjunction — radio receivers on Earth will not be able to distinguish STEREO's signal from the sun's radiation. Communication with the spacecraft will cease and the satellites will both go into safe mode without collecting data for a time. This will happen for STEREO-Ahead from March 24 to July 7, 2015. STEREO-Behind will be in superior conjunction from Jan. 22 to March 23, 2015. At least one spacecraft, therefore, will always be collecting data.  Before this occurs, the heating from the sun will also begin to affect – though not shut down — data collection. From wherever they are in space, the STEREO spacecraft aim their antenna toward Earth to send down data. This position puts the antenna fairly close to pointing at the sun, exposing the instruments to more heat than it can safely bear. The antenna can be adjusted to point in different directions, but the signal coming to Earth will be much fainter and won't allow for as much data to be downloaded. This antenna adjustment will begin on Aug. 20, 2014, for the STEREO-Ahead spacecraft and on Dec. 1, 2014, for STEREO-Behind.  During this phase, STEREO instruments will continue to run 24 hours a day, but they will gather lower-resolution data than usual. Some of this data will be downloaded whenever STEREO can link up with an Earth receiver. The rest of the data will be stored on board to be downloaded when the spacecraft reach a more auspicious geometrical position in early 2016.  To test for this off-pointing from the sun, STEREO-Ahead will undergo tests and not be collecting data from July 6-12, 2014. The same tests will be performed on STEREO-Behind from Sept. 29 – Oct. 6, 2014.  Throughout this entire phase until 2016, at least one STEREO spacecraft will be capturing data at any one time, so scientists will have an uninterrupted record of events on the sun to coordinate with the observations of solar telescopes on the Earth side. Real time monitoring of the sun, its flares and coronal mass ejections – information used by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to help forecast space weather — will also continue via a fleet of NASA spacecraft closer to Earth",

The second run examines the consequences of a large coronal mass ejection, such as The Carrington-Class CME of 1859. These model runs allow us to estimate consequences of a large event hitting Earth, so we can better protect power grids and satellites.  In an effort to understand and predict the impact of space weather events on Earth, the Community-Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, routinely runs computer models of the many historical events. These model runs are then compared to actual data to determine ways to improve the model, and therefore forecasts of future space weather events.  Sometimes we need an actual event to have data for comparison. Extreme space weather events are one example where researchers must test models with a rather limited set of data.

SET studies the very nature of space itself — which isn’t completely empty, but brimming with radiation — and how it affects spacecraft and electronics in orbit. Energetic particles from the Sun or deep space can spark memory damage or computer upsets on spacecraft, and over time, degrade hardware. SET seeks to better understand these effects in order to improve spacecraft design, engineering, and operations, and avoid future anomalies. Spacecraft protection is a key part of NASA’s mission as the agency’s Artemis program seeks to explore the Moon and beyond.  SET is part of the Space Environment Effects (SFx) experiment, one of three experiments on board the Demonstration and Science Experiments, or DSX, spacecraft being launched by the U.S. Air Force.   DSX is launching as part of the Space Test Program-2 (STP-2) mission, managed by the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC). SET is one of four NASA missions on this STP-2 launch — all of which are dedicated to improving technology in space. DSX separates from the launch vehicle approximately 3.5 hours after launch.   SET is the latest addition to NASA’s fleet of heliophysics observatories. NASA heliophysics missions study a vast interconnected system from the Sun to the space surrounding Earth and other planets, and to the farthest limits of the Sun’s constantly flowing stream of solar wind.

        description: "The sun erupted with one of the largest solar flares of this solar cycle on March 6, 2012 at 7PM ET. ?This flare was categorized as an X5.4, making it the second largest flare — after an X6.9 on August 9, 2011 — since the sun's activity segued into a period of relatively low activity called solar minimum in early 2007. The current increase in the number of X-class flares is part of the sun's normal 11-year solar cycle, during which activity on the sun ramps up to solar maximum, which is expected to peak in late 2013. About an hour later, at 8:14 PM ET, March 6, the same region let loose an X1.3 class flare. ?An X1 is 5 times smaller than an X5 flare.  These X-class flares erupted from an active region named AR 1429 that rotated into view on March 2. ?Prior to this, the region had already produced numerous M-class and one X-class flare. ?The region continues to rotate across the front of the sun, so the March 6 flare was more Earthward facing than the previous ones. ?It triggered a temporary radio blackout on the sunlit side of Earth that interfered with radio navigation and short wave radio.  In association with these flares, the sun also expelled two significant coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are traveling faster than 600 miles a second and may arrive at Earth in the next few days. ?In the meantime, the CME associated with the X-class flare from March 4 has dumped solar particles and magnetic fields into Earth's atmosphere and distorted Earth's magnetic fields, causing a moderate geomagnetic storm, rated a G2 on a scale from G1 to G5. ?Such storms happen when the magnetic fields around Earth rapidly change strength and shape. ?A moderate storm usually causes aurora and may interfere with high frequency radio transmission near the poles. ?This storm is already dwindling, but the Earth may experience another enhancement if the most recent CMEs are directed toward and impact Earth.  In addition, last night's flares have sent solar particles into Earth's atmosphere, producing a moderate solar energetic particle event, also called a solar radiation storm. These particles have been detected by NASA's SOHO and STEREO spacecraft, and NOAA's GOES spacecraft. ?At the time of writing, this storm is rated an S3 on a scale that goes up to S5. ?Such storms can interfere with high frequency radio communication.  Besides the August 2011 X-class flare, the last time the sun sent out flares of this magnitude was in 2006. ?There was an X6.5 on December 6, 2006 and an X9.0 on December 5, 2006. Like the most recent events, those two flares erupted from the same region on the sun, which is a common occurrence.",

Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth\'s atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground. However — when intense enough — they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel.  This flare is classified as an X1.6 class flare. "X-class" denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more information about its strength. An X2 is twice as intense as an X1, an X3 is three times as intense, etc.',

        description: 'On May 13, 2013, the sun emitted an X2.8-class flare, peaking at 12:05 p.m. EDT. This is the the strongest X-class flare of 2013 so far, surpassing in strength the X1.7-class flare that occurred 14 hours earlier. It is the 16th X-class flare of the current solar cycle and the third-largest flare of that cycle. The second-strongest was an X5.4 event on March 7, 2012. The strongest was an X6.9 on Aug. 9, 2011. On May 12, 2013, the sun emitted a significant solar flare, peaking at 10 p.m. EDT. This flare is classified as an X1.7, making it the first X-class flare of 2013. The flare was also associated with another solar phenomenon, called a coronal mass ejection (CME) that can send solar material out into space. This CME was not Earth-directed.  The May 12 flare was also associated with a coronal mass ejection, another solar phenomenon that can send billions of tons of solar particles into space, which can affect electronic systems in satellites and on the ground. Experimental NASA research models show that the CME left the sun at 745 miles per second and is not Earth-directed, however its flank may pass by the STEREO-B and Spitzer spacecraft, and their mission operators have been notified. If warranted, operators can put spacecraft into safe mode to protect the instruments from solar material. There is some particle radiation associated with this event, which is what can concern operators of interplanetary spacecraft since the particles can trip computer electronics on board.',

Some 4 billion years ago, the sun shone with only about three-quarters the brightness we see today, but its surface roiled with giant eruptions spewing enormous amounts of solar material and radiation out into space. These powerful solar explosions may have provided the crucial energy needed to warm Earth, despite the sun's faintness. The eruptions also may have furnished the energy needed to turn simple molecules into the complex molecules such as RNA and DNA that were necessary for life.  Understanding what conditions were necessary for life on our planet helps us both trace the origins of life on Earth and guide the search for life on other planets. Until now, however, fully mapping Earth's evolution has been hindered by the simple fact that the young sun wasn't luminous enough to warm Earth.  This newly discovered constant influx of solar particles to early Earth may have done more than just warm the atmosphere, it may also have provided the energy needed to make complex chemicals. In a planet scattered evenly with simple molecules, it takes a huge amount of incoming energy to create the complex molecules such as RNA and DNA that eventually seeded life.  While enough energy appears to be hugely important for a growing planet, too much would also be an issue -- a constant chain of solar eruptions producing showers of particle radiation can be quite detrimental. Such an onslaught of magnetic clouds can rip off a planet's atmosphere if the magnetosphere is too weak. Understanding these kinds of balances help scientists determine what kinds of stars and what kinds of planets could be hospitable for life.",

        description: "In late June 2013, the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, or IRIS, will launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. IRIS will tease out the rules governing the lowest layers of the solar atmosphere — historically some of the hardest to untangle. Known as the solar interface region, this is one of the most complex areas in the sun's atmosphere: all the energy that drives solar activity travels through it. The interface region lies between the sun’s 6,000-degree, white-hot, visible surface, the photosphere, and the much hotter multi-million-degree upper corona. Interactions between the violently moving plasma and the sun’s magnetic field in this area may well be the source of the energy that heats the corona to its million-degree temperatures, some hundreds and occasionally thousands of times hotter than the sun's surface. The chromosphere is also considered a candidate as the origin for giant explosions on the sun such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. IRIS will use high-resolution images, data and advanced computer models to unravel how solar gases move, gather energy and heat up through the lower solar atmosphere. Outfitted with state-of-the-art tools, IRIS will be able to tease apart what's happening in the solar interface region better than ever before.",

Thanks to this mission, which launched on Oct. 25, 2006, we can see and study the sun from multiple viewpoints – crucial for understanding solar activity and the evolution of space weather.  One of STEREO’s key instruments is called a coronagraph, which is used to study the corona, the sun’s outer atmosphere. Each of STEREO’s coronagraphs has a metal disk called an occulting disk. The occulting disk blocks the sun’s bright light and makes it possible to discern the detailed features of the surrounding corona, which is about one million times dimmer than the sun. Much like the way the bright headlights of a semi-truck at night hide just how big the truck is, the brightly shining sun makes it difficult to study the much fainter corona.  In celebration of the mission’s 10th anniversary, here is a guide to reading a STEREO image. Watch the video below, created with imagery of a massive July 2012 coronal mass ejection, to learn the key features of STEREO coronagraph data:  Space, in color  Each STEREO spacecraft has two coronagraphs with occulting disks of different sizes. The colors you see in the image are not true to life; scientists color the images to quickly tell which instrument in particular the image is from. In this video, the coronagraph image is colored blue.  Occulting disk  The black circle in the center of the coronagraph image is the occulting disk, which blocks the disk of the sun. The occulting disk mimics a total solar eclipse seen from Earth, in which the moon perfectly blocks the sun and allows observations of the massive corona.  The sun, in extreme ultraviolet light  Sometimes STEREO coronagraph images incorporate imagery from another one of STEREO’s instruments called the Extreme UltraViolet Imager, which captures the sun in a type of light that is invisible to human eyes. Later, these images are colorized. These extreme ultraviolet light images are sometimes imposed over the occulting disk to help give a sense of the sun’s size and position, and to provide more information as to which direction a solar eruption is headed. Extreme ultraviolet light images highlight active regions on the sun – regions where intense magnetic activity can give rise to solar eruptions. Here, STEREO observed the CME bursting forth from this active region.  Stars  Stars are often present in STEREO coronagraph images. These are the steady, brightly shining specks in the background.  Diffraction patterns  Faint ripples around the edge of the occulting disk result from diffracted light. When light enters the telescope, it hits the edge of the metal disk and bends, or diffracts, around the disk.  Streamers  Radial structures flowing out from the corona are called streamers. Solar material in streamers and the corona flow out into space to form the solar wind that fills our solar system.  Coronal mass ejections  Coronal mass ejections are eruptions of solar material that shoot far out into space, often accelerating particles ahead of them to near-light speeds. On July 23, 2012, STEREO-A saw this CME – one of the fastest on record. Scientists call this sort of CME a halo CME because the solar material forms a complete ring around the sun.  High-energy particle snow  As the CME expands beyond STEREO’s field of view, a flurry of what looks like snow floods the image. These are high-energy particles flung out ahead of the CME at near-light speeds, striking the charge-coupled device in STEREO’s camera. The immediacy and intensity of this “snowstorm” in space following the CME reflects just how fast and strong the eruption is: Less than an hour after the start of this eruption, accelerated particles traversed approximately 93 million miles from the sun to STEREO.',

        description: "The sun emitted a significant solar flare, peaking at 5:40 p.m. EDT on Oct. 24, 2014. NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which watches the sun constantly, captured images of the event. Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground, however -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel.  This flare is classified as an X3.1-class flare.  X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more information about its strength. An X2 is twice as intense as an X1, an X3 is three times as intense, etc.  The flare erupted from a particularly large active region -- labeled AR 12192 -- on the sun that is the largest in 24 years. This is the fourth substantial flare from this active region since Oct. 19.  The giant active region on the sun erupted on Oct. 26, 2014, with it's sixth substantial flare since Oct.19. This flare was classified as an X2-class flare and it peaked at 6:56 am EDT.  Continuing a week's worth of substantial flares beginning on Oct.19, 2014, the sun emitted two mid-level solar flares on Oct. 26 and Oct. 27. The first peaked at 8:34 pm EDT on Oct. 26, 2014, and the second peaked almost 10 hours later at 6:09 am EDT on Oct. 27. NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which constantly observes the sun, captured images of both flares.  A large active region on the sun erupted with another X-class flare, an X2.0, on Oct. 27, 2014 -- its fourth since Oct. 24. The flare peaked at 10:47 a.m. EDT.   The sun emitted a mid-level solar flare, an M6.6-class, peaking at 11:32 pm EDT on Oct. 28, 2014",

        description: "Two NASA spacecraft have provided the most comprehensive movie ever of a mysterious process at the heart of all explosions on the sun: magnetic reconnection. Magnetic reconnection happens when magnetic field lines come together, break apart, and then exchange partners, snapping into new positions and releasing a jolt of magnetic energy. This process lies at the heart of giant explosions on the sun such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, which can fling radiation and particles across the solar system.  Magnetic field lines, themselves, are invisible, but the sun's charged plasma particles course along their length. Space telescopes can see that material appearing as bright lines looping and arcing through the sun’s atmosphere, and so map out the presence of magnetic field lines.  Looking at a series of images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), scientists saw two bundles of field lines move toward each other, meet briefly to form what appeared to be an “X” and then shoot apart with one set of lines and its attendant particles leaping into space and one set falling back down onto the sun.  To confirm what they were seeing, the scientists turned to a second NASA spacecraft, the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). RHESSI collects spectrograms, a kind of data that can show where exceptionally hot material is present in any given event on the sun. RHESSI showed hot pockets of solar material forming above and below the reconnection point, an established signature of such an event. By combining the SDO and RHESSI data, the scientists were able to describe the process of what they were seeing, largely confirming previous models and theories, while revealing new, three-dimensional aspects of the process.",

NASA’s Parker Solar Probe is in the midst of intense environmental testing at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, in preparation for its journey to the Sun.

Parker Solar Probe will explore the Sun's outer atmosphere and make critical observations that will answer decades-old questions about the physics of stars. The resulting data will also help improve how we forecast major eruptions on the Sun and subsequent space weather events that can impact life on Earth, as well as satellites and astronauts in space.

  'AVAIL:Description': "On Sept. 10, 2017, the Hinode satellite observed an enormous X-class flare burst from an active region on the western edge of the Sun. The video shows the high-energy flare as seen by Hinode's X-Ray Telescope. The emission was so bright that the initial blast caused the detector to saturate. The giant explosion sent a huge cloud of superhot plasma zooming into interplanetary space -- a phenomenon known as a coronal mass ejection. Studying large flares like this one with a variety of instruments is key to understanding exactly what causes these dramatic eruptions, and one day predicting them before they occur.",

        description: "Flaring, active regions of our sun are highlighted in this image combining observations from several telescopes. High-energy X-rays from NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) are shown in blue; low-energy X-rays from Japan's Hinode spacecraft are green; and extreme ultraviolet light from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is yellow and red.  All three telescopes captured their solar images around the same time on April 29, 2015. The NuSTAR image is a mosaic made from combining smaller images.  The active regions across the sun's surface contain material heated to several millions of degrees. The blue-white areas showing the NuSTAR data pinpoint the most energetic spots. During the observations, microflares went off, which are smaller versions of the larger flares that also erupt from the sun's surface. The microflares rapidly release energy and heat the material in the active regions.  NuSTAR typically stares deeper into the cosmos to observe X-rays from supernovas, black holes and other extreme objects. But it can also look safely at the sun and capture images of its high-energy X-rays with more sensitivity than before. Scientists plan to continue to study the sun with NuSTAR to learn more about microflares, as well as hypothesized nanoflares, which are even smaller.  In this image, the NuSTAR data shows X-rays with energies between 2 and 6 kiloelectron volts; the Hinode data, which is from the X-ray Telescope instrument, has energies of 0.2 to 2.4 kiloelectron volts; and the Solar Dynamics Observatory data, taken using the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly instrument, shows extreme ultraviolet light with wavelengths of 171 and 193 Angstroms.  Note the green Hinode image frame edge does not extend as far as the SDO ultraviolet image, resulting in the green portion of the image being truncated on the right and left sides.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19821",

The activity was captured in a wavelength of extreme ultraviolet light. Because this occurred way over near the edge of the Sun, it was unlikely to have any effect on Earth.

But there is more to the connection between the two disciplines: science and art techniques are often quite similar, indeed one may inform the other or be improved based on lessons from the other arena. One such case is a technique known as a &quot;gradient filter&quot; – recognizable to many people as an option available on a photo-editing program. Gradients are, in fact, a mathematical description that highlights the places of greatest physical change in space. A gradient filter, in turn, enhances places of contrast, making them all the more obviously different, a useful tool when adjusting photos. Scientists, too, use gradient filters to enhance contrast, using them to accentuate fine structures that might otherwise be lost in the background noise. On the sun, for example, scientists wish to study a phenomenon known as coronal loops, which are giant arcs of solar material constrained to travel along that particular path by the magnetic fields in the sun\'s atmosphere. Observations of the loops, which can be more or less tangled and complex during different phases of the sun\'s 11-year activity cycle, can help researchers understand what\'s happening with the sun\'s complex magnetic fields, fields that can also power great eruptions on the sun such as solar flares or coronal mass ejections.  The still here shows an unfiltered image from the sun next to one that has been processed using a gradient filter. Note how the coronal loops are sharp and defined, making them all the more easy to study. On the other hand, gradients also make great art.

It is the first -- and may be the only -- time that we will ever see our solar system from such a vantage point. The image is a portion of a wide-angle image containing the sun and the region of space where the Earth and Venus were at the time with two narrow-angle pictures centered on each planet. The wide-angle was taken with the camera's darkest filter (a methane absorption band), and the shortest possible exposure (5 thousandths of a second) to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. The sun is not large in the sky as seen from Voyager's perspective at the edge of the solar system but is still eight million times brighter than the brightest star in Earth's sky, Sirius. The image of the sun you see is far larger than the actual dimension of the solar disk. The result of the brightness is a bright burned out image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera. The \"rays\" around the sun are a diffraction pattern of the calibration lamp which is mounted in front of the wide angle lens. The two narrow-angle frames containing the images of the Earth and Venus have been digitally mosaiced into the wide-angle image at the appropriate scale. These images were taken through three color filters and recombined to produce a color image. The violet, green and blue filters were used; exposure times were, for the Earth image, 0.72, 0.48 and 0.72 seconds, and for the Venus frame, 0.36, 0.24 and 0.36, respectively. Although the planetary pictures were taken with the narrow-angle camera (1500 mm focal length) and were not pointed directly at the sun, they show the effects of the glare from the nearby sun, in the form of long linear streaks resulting from the scattering of sunlight off parts of the camera and its sun shade. From Voyager's great distance both Earth and Venus are mere points of light, less than the size of a picture element even in the narrow-angle camera. Earth was a crescent only 0.12 pixel in size. Coincidentally, Earth lies right in the center of one of the scattered light rays resulting from taking the image so close to the sun. Detailed analysis also suggests that Voyager detected the moon as well, but it is too faint to be seen without special processing. Venus was only 0.11 pixel in diameter. The faint colored structure in both planetary frames results from sunlight scattered in the optics.   http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00450",

The complex overlay of lines can teach scientists about the ways the sun\'s magnetism changes in response to the constant movement on and inside the sun. Note how the magnetic fields are densest near the bright spots visible on the sun – which are magnetically strong active regions – and many of the field lines link one active region to another.  This magnetic map was created using the PFSS – Potential Field Source Surface – model, a model of the magnetic field in the sun’s atmosphere based on magnetic measurements of the solar surface. The underlying image was taken in extreme ultraviolet wavelengths of 171 angstroms. This type of light is invisible to our eyes, but is colorized here in gold.

        description: 'Caption: This image from June 20, 2013, at 11:15 p.m. EDT shows the bright light of a solar flare on the left side of the sun and an eruption of solar material shooting through the sun’s atmosphere, called a prominence eruption. Shortly thereafter, this same region of the sun sent a coronal mass ejection out into space.  ---  On June 20, 2013, at 11:24 p.m., the sun erupted with an Earth-directed coronal mass ejection or CME, a solar phenomenon that can send billions of tons of particles into space that can reach Earth one to three days later. These particles cannot travel through the atmosphere to harm humans on Earth, but they can affect electronic systems in satellites and on the ground.  Experimental NASA research models, based on observations from NASA’s Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory and ESA/NASA’s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory show that the CME left the sun at speeds of around 1350 miles per second, which is a fast speed for CMEs.  Earth-directed CMEs can cause a space weather phenomenon called a geomagnetic storm, which occurs when they funnel energy into Earth\'s magnetic envelope, the magnetosphere, for an extended period of time. The CME’s magnetic fields peel back the outermost layers of Earth\'s fields changing their very shape. Magnetic storms can degrade communication signals and cause unexpected electrical surges in power grids. They also can cause aurora. Storms are rare during solar minimum, but as the sun’s activity ramps up every 11 years toward solar maximum – currently expected in late 2013 -- large storms occur several times per year.  In the past, geomagnetic storms caused by CMEs of this strength and direction have usually been mild.

        description: 'Caption: This image from June 20, 2013, at 11:15 p.m. EDT shows the bright light of a solar flare on the left side of the sun and an eruption of solar material shooting through the sun’s atmosphere, called a prominence eruption. Shortly thereafter, this same region of the sun sent a coronal mass ejection out into space.  ---  On June 20, 2013, at 11:24 p.m., the sun erupted with an Earth-directed coronal mass ejection or CME, a solar phenomenon that can send billions of tons of particles into space that can reach Earth one to three days later. These particles cannot travel through the atmosphere to harm humans on Earth, but they can affect electronic systems in satellites and on the ground.  Experimental NASA research models, based on observations from NASA’s Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory and ESA/NASA’s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory show that the CME left the sun at speeds of around 1350 miles per second, which is a fast speed for CMEs.  Earth-directed CMEs can cause a space weather phenomenon called a geomagnetic storm, which occurs when they funnel energy into Earth\'s magnetic envelope, the magnetosphere, for an extended period of time. The CME’s magnetic fields peel back the outermost layers of Earth\'s fields changing their very shape. Magnetic storms can degrade communication signals and cause unexpected electrical surges in power grids. They also can cause aurora. Storms are rare during solar minimum, but as the sun’s activity ramps up every 11 years toward solar maximum – currently expected in late 2013 -- large storms occur several times per year.  In the past, geomagnetic storms caused by CMEs of this strength and direction have usually been mild.

The CME originated from the far side of the Sun and did not have any interaction with the comet. The comet, only perhaps 30 meters across, was not seen after it went out of view, likely disintegrated by the heat and radiation from the Sun. We call this a &quot;full halo&quot; CME since the front edge of the CME is expanding in all directions around the Sun like a halo.  The images were taken by SOHO\'s coronagraphs in which a disk (red) blocks the Sun and some of the area around it so we can see faint structures beyond that.

        title: 'Comet ISON Approaching the Sun [still]',
        description: 'This movie from NASA’s STEREO spacecraft\'s Heliospheric Imager shows Comet ISON, Mercury, Comet Encke and Earth over a five-day period from Nov. 20 to Nov. 25, 2013. The sun sits right of the field of view of this camera. Comet ISON, which will round the sun on Nov. 28, is what\'s known as a sungrazing comet, due to its close approach.  Foreshortening or the angle at which these images were obtained make Earth appear as if it is closer to the sun than Mercury. If you look closely you will also see a dimmer and smaller comet Encke near comet ISON.   A comet’s journey through the solar system is perilous and violent. A giant ejection of solar material from the sun could rip its tail off. Before it reaches Mars -- at some 230 million miles away from the sun -- the radiation of the sun begins to boil its water, the first step toward breaking apart. And, if it survives all this, the intense radiation and pressure as it flies near the surface of the sun could destroy it altogether.  Even if the comet does not survive, tracking its journey will help scientists understand what the comet is made of, how it reacts to its environment, and what this explains about the origins of the solar system. Closer to the sun, watching how the comet and its tail interact with the vast solar atmosphere can teach scientists more about the sun itself.

        description: 'Date: 19 Nov 2013  Comet ISON shows off its tail in this three-minute exposure taken on 19 Nov. 2013 at 6:10 a.m. EST, using a 14-inch telescope located at the Marshall Space Flight Center. The comet is just nine days away from its close encounter with the sun; hopefully it will survive to put on a nice show during the first week of December. The star images are trailed because the telescope is tracking on the comet, which is now exhibiting obvious motion with respect to the background stars over a period of minutes.  At the time of this image, Comet ISON was some 44 million miles from the sun -- and 80 million miles from Earth -- moving at a speed of 136,700 miles per hour.  Credit: NASA/MSFC/Aaron Kingery  --------  More details on Comet ISON:  Comet ISON began its trip from the Oort cloud region of our solar system and is now travelling toward the sun. The comet will reach its closest approach to the sun on Thanksgiving Day -- 28 Nov 2013 -- skimming just 730,000 miles above the sun\'s surface. If it comes around the sun without breaking up, the comet will be visible in the Northern Hemisphere with the naked eye, and from what we see now, ISON is predicted to be a particularly bright and beautiful comet.  Catalogued as C/2012 S1, Comet ISON was first spotted 585 million miles away in September 2012. This is ISON\'s very first trip around the sun, which means it is still made of pristine matter from the earliest days of the solar system’s formation, its top layers never having been lost by a trip near the sun. Comet ISON is, like all comets, a dirty snowball made up of dust and frozen gases like water, ammonia, methane and carbon dioxide -- some of the fundamental building blocks that scientists believe led to the formation of the planets 4.5 billion years ago.   NASA has been using a vast fleet of spacecraft, instruments, and space- and Earth-based telescope, in order to learn more about this time capsule from when the solar system first formed.   The journey along the way for such a sun-grazing comet can be dangerous. A giant ejection of solar material from the sun could rip its tail off. Before it reaches Mars -- at some 230 million miles away from the sun -- the radiation of the sun begins to boil its water, the first step toward breaking apart. And, if it survives all this, the intense radiation and pressure as it flies near the surface of the sun could destroy it altogether.   This collection of images show ISON throughout that journey, as scientists watched to see whether the comet would break up or remain intact.    The comet reaches its closest approach to the sun on Thanksgiving Day -- Nov. 28, 2013 -- skimming just 730,000 miles above the sun’s surface. If it comes around the sun without breaking up, the comet will be visible in the Northern Hemisphere with the naked eye, and from what we see now, ISON is predicted to be a particularly bright and beautiful comet.   ISON stands for International Scientific Optical Network, a group of observatories in ten countries who have organized to detect, monitor, and track objects in space. ISON is managed by the Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics, part of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  <b><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html" rel="nofollow">NASA image use policy.</a></b>  <b><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html" rel="nofollow">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

It has been processed to highlight the edges of each loop to make the structure more clear.  A series of loops such as this is known as a flux rope, and these lie at the heart of eruptions on the sun known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs.) This is the first time scientists were able to discern the timing of a flux rope\'s formation.  (SDO AIA 131 and 171 difference blended image of flux ropes during CME.)  Credit: NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center/SDO  ----  On July 18, 2012, a fairly small explosion of light burst off the lower right limb of the sun. Such flares often come with an associated eruption of solar material, known as a coronal mass ejection or CME – but this one did not. Something interesting did happen, however. Magnetic field lines in this area of the sun\'s atmosphere, the corona, began to twist and kink, generating the hottest solar material – a charged gas called plasma – to trace out the newly-formed slinky shape. The plasma glowed brightly in extreme ultraviolet images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and scientists were able to watch for the first time the very formation of something they had long theorized was at the heart of many eruptive events on the sun: a flux rope.  Eight hours later, on July 19, the same region flared again. This time the flux rope\'s connection to the sun was severed, and the magnetic fields escaped into space, dragging billions of tons of solar material along for the ride -- a classic CME.  &quot;Seeing this structure was amazing,&quot; says Angelos Vourlidas, a solar scientist at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. &quot;It looks exactly like the cartoon sketches theorists have been drawing of flux ropes since the 1970s. It was a series of figure eights lined up to look like a giant slinky on the sun.&quot;  <b>To read more about this new discovery go to: <a href="http://1.usa.gov/14UHsTt" rel="nofollow">1.usa.gov/14UHsTt</a> </b>',

        description: 'This movie from NASA’s STEREO spacecraft\'s Heliospheric Imager shows Comet ISON, Mercury, Comet Encke and Earth over a five-day period from Nov. 20 to Nov. 25, 2013. The sun sits right of the field of view of this camera. Comet ISON, which will round the sun on Nov. 28, is what\'s known as a sungrazing comet, due to its close approach.  Foreshortening or the angle at which these images were obtained make Earth appear as if it is closer to the sun than Mercury. If you look closely you will also see a dimmer and smaller comet Encke near comet ISON.    A comet’s journey through the solar system is perilous and violent. A giant ejection of solar material from the sun could rip its tail off. Before it reaches Mars -- at some 230 million miles away from the sun -- the radiation of the sun begins to boil its water, the first step toward breaking apart. And, if it survives all this, the intense radiation and pressure as it flies near the surface of the sun could destroy it altogether.   Even if the comet does not survive, tracking its journey will help scientists understand what the comet is made of, how it reacts to its environment, and what this explains about the origins of the solar system. Closer to the sun, watching how the comet and its tail interact with the vast solar atmosphere can teach scientists more about the sun itself.

        description: 'Caption: This is an image of magnetic loops on the sun, captured by NASA\'s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).  It has been processed to highlight the edges of each loop to make the structure more clear.  A series of loops such as this is known as a flux rope, and these lie at the heart of eruptions on the sun known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs.) This is the first time scientists were able to discern the timing of a flux rope\'s formation.  (SDO AIA 131 and 171 difference blended image of flux ropes during CME.)  Credit: NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center/SDO  ----  On July 18, 2012, a fairly small explosion of light burst off the lower right limb of the sun. Such flares often come with an associated eruption of solar material, known as a coronal mass ejection or CME – but this one did not. Something interesting did happen, however. Magnetic field lines in this area of the sun\'s atmosphere, the corona, began to twist and kink, generating the hottest solar material – a charged gas called plasma – to trace out the newly-formed slinky shape. The plasma glowed brightly in extreme ultraviolet images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and scientists were able to watch for the first time the very formation of something they had long theorized was at the heart of many eruptive events on the sun: a flux rope.  Eight hours later, on July 19, the same region flared again. This time the flux rope\'s connection to the sun was severed, and the magnetic fields escaped into space, dragging billions of tons of solar material along for the ride -- a classic CME.  &quot;Seeing this structure was amazing,&quot; says Angelos Vourlidas, a solar scientist at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. &quot;It looks exactly like the cartoon sketches theorists have been drawing of flux ropes since the 1970s. It was a series of figure eights lined up to look like a giant slinky on the sun.&quot;  <b>To read more about this new discovery go to: <a href="http://1.usa.gov/14UHsTt" rel="nofollow">1.usa.gov/14UHsTt</a> </b>',

Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth\'s atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground, however -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel. This disrupts the radio signals for as long as the flare is ongoing, and the radio blackout for this flare has already subsided.    This flare is classified as an M5.7 class flare. M-class flares are the weakest flares that can still cause some space weather effects near Earth. Increased numbers of flares are quite common at the moment, since the sun\'s normal 11-year activity cycle is ramping up toward solar maximum, which is expected in late 2013.

A series of loops such as this is known as a flux rope, and these lie at the heart of eruptions on the sun known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs.) This is the first time scientists were able to discern the timing of a flux rope\'s formation.   Credit: NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center/SDO  ----  On July 18, 2012, a fairly small explosion of light burst off the lower right limb of the sun. Such flares often come with an associated eruption of solar material, known as a coronal mass ejection or CME – but this one did not. Something interesting did happen, however. Magnetic field lines in this area of the sun\'s atmosphere, the corona, began to twist and kink, generating the hottest solar material – a charged gas called plasma – to trace out the newly-formed slinky shape. The plasma glowed brightly in extreme ultraviolet images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and scientists were able to watch for the first time the very formation of something they had long theorized was at the heart of many eruptive events on the sun: a flux rope.  Eight hours later, on July 19, the same region flared again. This time the flux rope\'s connection to the sun was severed, and the magnetic fields escaped into space, dragging billions of tons of solar material along for the ride -- a classic CME.  &quot;Seeing this structure was amazing,&quot; says Angelos Vourlidas, a solar scientist at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. &quot;It looks exactly like the cartoon sketches theorists have been drawing of flux ropes since the 1970s.

Combined with the energy from ripples in the magnetic field, they may contain enough energy to power the solar wind that streams from the sun toward Earth at 1.5 million miles per hour.   Credit: NASA/SDO/AIA   Like giant strands of seaweed some 32,000 miles high, material shooting up from the sun sways back and forth with the atmosphere. In the ocean, it\'s moving water that pulls the seaweed along for a ride; in the sun\'s corona, magnetic field ripples called Alfvén waves cause the swaying.  For years these waves were too difficult to detect directly, but NASA\'s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is now able to track the movements of this solar &quot;seaweed&quot; and measure how much energy is carried by the Alfvén waves. The research shows that the waves carry more energy than previously thought, and possibly enough to drive two solar phenomena whose causes remain points of debate: the intense heating of the corona to some 20 times hotter than the sun\'s surface and solar winds that blast up to 1.5 million miles per hour.  &quot;SDO has amazing resolution so you can actually see individual waves,&quot; says Scott McIntosh at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. &quot;Now we can see that instead of these waves having about 1000th the energy needed as we previously thought, it has the equivalent of about 1100W light bulb for every 11 square feet of the sun\'s surface, which is enough to heat the sun\'s atmosphere and drive the solar wind.&quot;  To read more go to: <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sdo/news/alfven-waves.html" rel="nofollow">www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sdo/news/alfven-waves.html</a>  <b><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html" rel="nofollow">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.

Credit: NASA/Goddard/SDO  ---  The sun emitted a mid-level solar flare, peaking at 1:32 pm EDT on May 3, 2013. Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth\'s atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground, however -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel. This disrupts the radio signals for as long as the flare is ongoing, and the radio blackout for this flare has already subsided.    This flare is classified as an M5.7 class flare. M-class flares are the weakest flares that can still cause some space weather effects near Earth.

Credit: NASA/Goddard/SDO  ---  The sun emitted a mid-level solar flare, peaking at 1:32 pm EDT on May 3, 2013. Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth\'s atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground, however -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel. This disrupts the radio signals for as long as the flare is ongoing, and the radio blackout for this flare has already subsided.    This flare is classified as an M5.7 class flare.

        description: "The cameras of Voyager 1 on Feb. 14, 1990, pointed back toward the sun and took a series of pictures of the sun and the planets, making the first ever portrait of our solar system as seen from the outside.  In the course of taking this mosaic consisting of a total of 60 frames, Voyager 1 made several images of the inner solar system from a distance of approximately 4 billion miles and about 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane. Thirty-nine wide angle frames link together six of the planets of our solar system in this mosaic. Outermost Neptune is 30 times further from the sun than Earth. Our sun is seen as the bright object in the center of the circle of frames. The wide-angle image of the sun was taken with the camera's darkest filter (a methane absorption band) and the shortest possible exposure (5 thousandths of a second) to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. The sun is not large as seen from Voyager, only about one-fortieth of the diameter as seen from Earth, but is still almost 8 million times brighter than the brightest star in Earth's sky, Sirius. The result of this great brightness is an image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera. Wide-angle images surrounding the sun also show many artifacts attributable to scattered light in the optics. These were taken through the clear filter with one second exposures. The insets show the planets magnified many times. Narrow-angle images of Earth, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune were acquired as the spacecraft built the wide-angle mosaic. Jupiter is larger than a narrow-angle pixel and is clearly resolved, as is Saturn with its rings. Uranus and Neptune appear larger than they really are because of image smear due to spacecraft motion during the long (15 second) exposures. From Voyager's great distance Earth and Venus are mere points of light, less than the size of a picture element even in the narrow-angle camera. Earth was a crescent only 0.12 pixel in size. Coincidentally, Earth lies right in the center of one of the scattered light rays resulting from taking the image so close to the sun.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00451",

        title: "Hotspots in Fountains on the Sun's Surface Help Explain Coronal Heating Mystery",
        description: 'NASA image release January 6, 2010  Caption: Spicules on the sun, as observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory. These bursts of gas jet off the surface of the sun at 150,000 miles per hour and contain gas that reaches temperatures over a million degrees.  GREENBELT, Md. -- Observations from NASA\'s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Japanese satellite Hinode show that some gas in the giant, fountain-like jets in the sun\'s atmosphere known as spicules can reach temperatures of millions of degrees. The finding offers a possible new framework for how the sun\'s high atmosphere gets so much hotter than the surface of the sun.   What makes the high atmosphere, or corona, so hot – over a million degrees, compared to the sun surface\'s 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit -- remains a poorly understood aspect of the sun\'s complicated space weather system. That weather system can reach Earth, causing auroral lights and, if strong enough, disrupting Earth\'s communications and power systems. Understanding such phenomena, therefore, is an important step towards better protecting our satellites and power grids.   &quot;The traditional view is that all the heating happens higher up in the corona,&quot; says Dean Pesnell, who is SDO\'s project scientist at NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. &quot;The suggestion in this paper is that cool gas is being ejected from the sun\'s surface in spicules and getting heated on its way to the corona.&quot;  Spicules were first named in the 1940s, but were hard to study in detail until recently, says Bart De Pontieu of Lockheed Martin\'s Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory, Palo Alto, Calif. who is the lead author on a paper on this subject in the January 7, 2011 issue of Science magazine.   In visible light, spicules can be seen to send large masses of so-called plasma – the electromagnetic gas that surrounds the sun – up through the lower solar atmosphere or photosphere. The amount of material sent up is stunning, some 100 times as much as streams away from the sun in the solar wind towards the edges of the solar system. But nobody knew if they contained hot gas.  &quot;Heating of spicules to the necessary hot temperatures has never been observed, so their role in coronal heating had been dismissed as unlikely,&quot; says De Pontieu.   Now, De Pontieu\'s team -- which included researchers at Lockheed Martin, the High Altitude Observatory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Colorado and the University of Oslo, Norway -- was able to combine images from SDO and Hinode to produce a more complete picture of the gas inside these gigantic fountains.   The scientists found that a large fraction of the gas is heated to a hundred thousand degrees, while a small fraction is heated to millions of degrees. Time-lapsed images show that this material spews up into the corona, with most falling back down towards the surface of the sun. However, the small fraction of the gas that is heated to millions of degrees does not immediately return to the surface. Given the large number of spicules on the Sun, and the amount of material in the spicules, the scientists believe that if even some of that super hot plasma stays aloft it would make a contribution to coronal heating.   Astrophysicist Jonathan Cirtain, who is the U.S. project scientist for Hinode at NASA\'s Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala., says that incorporating such new information helps address an important question that reaches far beyond the sun. &quot;This breakthrough in our understanding of the mechanisms which transfer energy from the solar photosphere to the corona addresses one of the most compelling questions in stellar astrophysics: How is the atmosphere of a star heated?&quot; he says. &quot;This is a fantastic discovery, and demonstrates the muscle of the NASA Heliophysics System Observatory, comprised of numerous instruments on multiple observatories.&quot;  Hinode is the second mission in NASA\'s Solar Terrestrial Probes program, the goal of which is to improve understanding of fundamental solar and space physics processes. The mission is led by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ). The collaborative mission includes the U.S., the United Kingdom, Norway and Europe. NASA Marshall manages Hinode U.S. science operations and oversaw development of the scientific instrumentation provided for the mission by NASA, academia and industry. The Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center is the lead U.S. investigator for the Solar Optical Telescope on Hinode.  SDO is the first mission in a NASA science program called Living With a Star, the goal of which is to develop the scientific understanding necessary to address those aspects of the sun-Earth system that directly affect our lives and society. NASA Goddard built, operates, and manages the SDO spacecraft for NASA\'s Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

        title: 'Two Coronal Holes on the Sun Viewed by SDO',
        description: 'NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory, or SDO, captured this solar image on March 16, 2015, which clearly shows two dark patches, known as coronal holes. The larger coronal hole of the two, near the southern pole, covers an estimated 6- to 8-percent of the total solar surface. While that may not sound significant, it is one of the largest polar holes scientists have observed in decades. The smaller coronal hole, towards the opposite pole, is long and narrow. It covers about 3.8 billion square miles on the sun - only about 0.16-percent of the solar surface.  Coronal holes are lower density and temperature regions of the sun’s outer atmosphere, known as the corona. Coronal holes can be a source of fast solar wind of solar particles that envelop the Earth.  The magnetic field in these regions extends far out into space rather than quickly looping back into the sun’s surface. Magnetic fields that loop up and back down to the surface can be seen as arcs in non-coronal hole regions of the image, including over the lower right horizon.  The bright active region on the lower right quadrant is the same region that produced solar flares last week.

        title: "NASA's SDO Sees Giant Filament on the Sun",
        description: 'A dark line snaked across the lower half of the sun on Feb.10, 2015, as seen in this image from NASA\'s Solar Dynamics Observatory, or SDO. SDO shows colder material as dark and hotter material as light, so the line is, in fact, an enormous swatch of colder material hovering in the sun\'s atmosphere, the corona. Stretched out, that line – or solar filament as scientists call it – would be more than 533,000 miles long. That is longer than 67 Earths lined up in a row.  Filaments can float sedately for days before disappearing. Sometimes they also erupt out into space, releasing solar material in a shower that either rains back down or escapes out into space, becoming a moving cloud known as a coronal mass ejection, or CME.  SDO captured images of the filament in numerous wavelengths, each of which helps highlight material of different temperatures on the sun. By looking at such features in different wavelengths and temperatures, scientists learn more about what causes these structures, as well as what catalyzes their occasional eruptions.

        description: 'Caption: This is an image of magnetic loops on the sun, captured by NASA\'s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).  It has been processed to highlight the edges of each loop to make the structure more clear.  A series of loops such as this is known as a flux rope, and these lie at the heart of eruptions on the sun known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs.) This is the first time scientists were able to discern the timing of a flux rope\'s formation.  (Blended 131 Angstrom and 171 Angstrom images of July 19, 2012 flare and CME.)  Credit: NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center/SDO  ----  On July 18, 2012, a fairly small explosion of light burst off the lower right limb of the sun. Such flares often come with an associated eruption of solar material, known as a coronal mass ejection or CME – but this one did not. Something interesting did happen, however. Magnetic field lines in this area of the sun\'s atmosphere, the corona, began to twist and kink, generating the hottest solar material – a charged gas called plasma – to trace out the newly-formed slinky shape. The plasma glowed brightly in extreme ultraviolet images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and scientists were able to watch for the first time the very formation of something they had long theorized was at the heart of many eruptive events on the sun: a flux rope.  Eight hours later, on July 19, the same region flared again. This time the flux rope\'s connection to the sun was severed, and the magnetic fields escaped into space, dragging billions of tons of solar material along for the ride -- a classic CME.  &quot;Seeing this structure was amazing,&quot; says Angelos Vourlidas, a solar scientist at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. &quot;It looks exactly like the cartoon sketches theorists have been drawing of flux ropes since the 1970s. It was a series of figure eights lined up to look like a giant slinky on the sun.&quot;  <b>To read more about this new discovery go to: <a href="http://1.usa.gov/14UHsTt" rel="nofollow">1.usa.gov/14UHsTt</a> </b>  <b><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html" rel="nofollow">NASA image use policy.</a></b>  <b><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html" rel="nofollow">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a></b> enables NASA’s mission through four scientific endeavors: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Solar System Exploration, and Astrophysics.
